It is important to note that due to the minimum traffic on the K \\<> P Bridge, no funds from the bounty have been spent so far. A new partnership with Hacken and the inclusion in the scope of the bounty of Snowbridge and Hyperbridge, as well as the change of curators to also reflect this change, will allow us to deliver on the increase of interest of reporters on Hacken platform. \n\n\n\nFor more details about the scope and how this bounty works please check at [<u>https://polkadot.com/bridges-bug-bounty/</u>](https://polkadot.com/bridges-bug-bounty/).\n\n\n\nStatus of what has been delivered so far:\n\n\n\n* In 2024, there has been limited traffic to the bridge so the level of attraction within the researcher community has been limited.\n* Since Q1-2025 and thanks to an initial partnership with the Hacken Bounty platform and help from Distractive, the bounty has received increased attention from researchers ([<u>Hacken Portal</u>](https://hackenproof.com/programs/polkadot-bridge)) with +15000 scope reviews. \n* No bounties have been paid and no fees have been paid, all activities have been done pro bono by all stakeholders including curators and partners.\n\n\n\nThe next steps are:\n\n\n\n* The new curator team aims to continue to improve things by:\n  * Reinforcing the security partnership between bridges by expanding the scope to [<u>Snowbridge</u>](https://app.snowbridge.network/) and [<u>Hyperbridge</u>](https://app.hyperbridge.network/) especially in the context of the recent increase of traffic through the different bridges.\n  * Reviewing the total reward amount available to reporters with the different scope adding funds to a consolidated reward pool\n  * Reviewing the reward and fee structure for the different stakeholders\n  * Reinforcing the [<u>visibility</u>](https://x.com/HackenProof/status/1895140859362120088) to attract more researchers at the different events, on social media and Bounty Platform\n  * Partnering with other Bounties including [<u>Polkadot Assurance Legion.</u>](https://dotpal.io/)\n* More details about the above will be shared to the community in September/October 2025 in the direction channels and on this post.\n\n\n\nNOTE: A mirror referendum is happening in Polkadot as the Bounty is on both networks.\n\n\n\nCurator changes:\n\n* The security nested MSG was creating more operational complexity than specific added value so it is suppressed (it was requiring more coordination of people and in addition Multisig containing another Multisig is not supported in the same way by the different tools and as a consequence made on chain transactions more complicated to raise and sign).\n* [<u>Jeroen</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/1ubpnuk7AwPwmEnuhxuv3f5pvwp8X1QdqcMucSwdDDehSGB) and [<u>Kirill</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/13zU1pipCuijDA1eWdHPnDgEHh3BvDJ9GsPMMFFvE5p6GF4D) are not part of this new set of curators, and we would like to take the opportunity to thank them for the initial phase of this bounty.\n* As a consequence the new curators are 5 and not 7, aligned with the different bridges part of the scope.\n\n\n\nCurators of the new MSG:\n\n* [<u>Valery</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/15BERoWxrWC61cAb4JjpUdM7sy8FAS9uduismDbZ7PURZLto) - Cl0x (Hydration team)\n* [<u>Vince</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/14Pn8sUxdEMgFRDgZ5J2VfcUVMLaMQhst9XuvCj9mKJYUAN2) - VinceCorsica (Parity’s Security)\n* [<u>Adrian</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/121dd6J26VUnBZ8BqLGjANWkEAXSb9mWq1SB7LsS9QNTGFvz) - Kata (Parity Bridge team)\n* [<u>Vincent</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/16YdterMH6axUsZP52fF3M7JJePfNB3yCd8dXwniEofpTSiP) - SnowBridge team\n* [<u>Seun</u>](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/user/1333zsMafds2sKAr8nG3zwXTCHPYv2Nm6CRgakpu6YVGt7nM) - Hyperbridge team",

      "userId": 2396,
      "content": "## **Subscan 2025 Q1-Q2 Funding Proposal: Basic service fee for the Kusama Relaychain and Kusama public parachain (AssetHub, Coretime, BridgeHub, People)**\n\n> *Due to potential display issues with some charts in markdown format across various devices and platforms, please refer to the detailed information in this Google Document:*\n> [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MdAecFs36pUq8lT-pkCW-P7LzSdEsShr\\_k84ct4yQWs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MdAecFs36pUq8lT-pkCW-P7LzSdEsShr_k84ct4yQWs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSubscan is one of the most widely used blockchain explorers and indexers in the Polkadot ecosystem. It serves developers, validators, parachain teams, governance participants, and the wider community with reliable, accurate, and comprehensive blockchain data. Our infrastructure underpins operational reliability, governance transparency, and cross-chain interoperability — playing an indispensable role in the growth and decision-making processes of the ecosystem.\n\n### **Past proposals**\n\n* [<u>#229 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine (from July to December 2022)</u>](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/229)\n* [<u>#377 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Asset Hub (Kusama) Networks (from January 2023 to March 2024)</u>](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/377)\n* [<u>#434 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine Networks (from April to June 2024)</u>](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/434)\n* [<u>#482 Subscan Q2/Q3/Q4 2024 Funding Proposal: Basic service fee for the Kusama Relaychain and Kusama public parachain (AssetHub, Coretime, BridgeHub, People)</u>](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/482)\n\n###\n\n### **Overview and Rationale**\n\nSubscan has long served as a core data infrastructure provider within the Kusama ecosystem, delivering stable, accurate, and low-latency blockchain indexing and explorer services for the relay chain and multiple public parachains (AssetHub, Coretime, BridgeHub, People).\nOver the past several quarters, on-chain transaction volumes, event counts, and the number of parachains have all grown steadily. This has directly increased database storage requirements and API load. Whether it is developers debugging dApps, validators monitoring node health, or community members tracking governance and asset data, these services all rely on Subscan’s reliability and precision.\n\nFor Q1–Q2 2025, our primary goals are:\n\n1. **Ensure operational stability across 5 networks** — covering data collection, indexing, storage, and API services for the Kusama relay chain and four public parachains.\n2. **Maintain data quality and performance** — ensuring indexing accuracy and query responsiveness despite continuous data growth.\n3. **Support ecosystem expansion** — through ongoing improvements to the basic module, governance data coverage, and cross-chain data parsing capabilities.\n\nThis proposal ensures the Kusama ecosystem continues to benefit from reliable and transparent data services, with costs tied directly to real usage metrics.\n\n### **Scope of This Proposal**\n\n**Q1\\&Q2 Maintenance (5 Networks)**:\n\n* **Relay Chain:** Kusama\n* **Public Parachains**: AssetHub, Coretime, BridgeHub, People\n\nThese networks benefit from high-quality data indexing, stable uptime, accurate block and transaction data, NFT indexing improvements, and reliable APIs that developers and validators depend on daily.\n\nWorth explicitly stating and cross-referencing that this request covers maintenance only. Any development work for Kusama-specific features is provided at no additional cost, as the one-time development expenses have already been covered under the Polkadot proposal. Adapting existing functionality to the Kusama network requires minimal effort and therefore incurs **no extra charges**.\n\n### **Benefits to Different User Groups**\n\n* **Developers**: The enhanced APIs and improved indexing accuracy allow developers to more quickly access real-time and historical data, enabling them to build more reliable dApps and automation tools.\n* **Validators & Parachain Teams**: Up-to-date block information, node health monitoring, and clear notification pipelines help validators maintain stable operations and quickly address issues. Parachain teams receive timely insights into network performance, asset transfers, and governance activities, facilitating better decision-making.\n* **End-Users & Traders**: Subscan’s improved UI/UX, faster data retrieval, and more accurate token pricing empower end-users to confidently explore and evaluate chain data. Improved NFT module performance enhances the experience for users and creators alike, making the platform more accessible and engaging.\n\n### **Service Fee Model & Pricing Methodology**\n\nOur maintenance packages are designed to address a variety of data needs, ensuring smooth and efficient operations. Given the complexity of our overall cost structure—which includes expenses for GCP, Cloudflare, Datadog, Onfinality, Dwellir, and Subscan’s team operations—we use storage as the primary metric to determine fees. Storage usage strongly correlates with total costs and fluctuates as new blocks are produced. To maintain fairness and accuracy, we use the median storage value measured on the 15th day of each quarter to establish the quarterly baseline fee.\n\n**Pricing Tiers**:\n**a. Basic Plan**\n\n* Up to 200 GB: $799/month\n* Beyond 200 GB: $5.3/GB\n* Automatically upgrades to the next tier after 350 GB\n\n**b. Advanced Plan**\n\n* Up to 500 GB: $1,699/month\n* Beyond 500 GB: $5.2/GB\n* Automatically upgrades to the next tier after 750 GB\n\n**c. Professional Plan**\n\n* Up to 1 TB: $2,999/month\n* Beyond 1 TB: $5/GB\n\n### **Monthly Service Fee Breakdown**\n\n1. **Database Storage & Indexing**\n   * **What It Covers**: Continuous indexing of on-chain data—from blocks and transactions to event logs, governance info, and NFTs—so users can reliably access both real-time and historical records.\n   * **Why It Matters**: As chain activity increases, so does data volume. By tying fees to storage needs, we accurately account for the costs of scaling infrastructure (e.g., additional database capacity).\n2. **Network Egress Bandwidth**\n   * **What It Covers**: The outgoing traffic required to serve user requests quickly and consistently, including API calls, UI data retrieval, and integrations with third-party tools.\n   * **Why It Matters**: A stable, high-bandwidth connection ensures that explorers, wallets, and dApps receive timely data responses, even during peak activity.\n3. **Monitoring & DevOps**\n   * **What It Covers**: Round-the-clock health checks, internal alert pipelines, CI/CD automation, and system auditing. This includes running multiple nodes, maintaining synchronization, and ensuring high availability.\n   * **Why It Matters**: These processes help detect issues early (e.g., node crashes, indexer slowdowns) and streamline updates or deployments, minimizing service disruption for the community.\n4. **Node Status Monitoring & Notifications**\n   * **What It Covers**: Dedicated tools and alert mechanisms to track the real-time status of network nodes—particularly those relating to the Kusama Relay Chain and the associated parachains (Assethub, Coretime, Bridgehub, People).\n   * **Why It Matters**: Quick notifications enable parachain teams, validators, and the wider ecosystem to react rapidly to performance changes, forks, or potential security incidents.\n5. **Technical Support & Troubleshooting**\n   * **What It Covers**: Responsive assistance for users, developers, and validators, including issue resolution, feature guidance, and integration help.\n   * **Why It Matters**: Timely support keeps the ecosystem running smoothly and fosters a positive development environment—especially crucial for teams building dApps, explorers, and automation tools.\n\n### **Why We Use Storage as a Pricing Metric**\n\n* **Correlation to Real Costs**: Storage growth scales in tandem with block production and transaction activity, making it a more stable metric than raw API traffic.\n* **Quarterly Baseline**: By measuring the median storage on the 15th day of each quarter, we capture a fair snapshot of usage to determine the appropriate fee tier.\n* **Predictable Billing**: This approach reduces wild fluctuations tied to sudden traffic spikes and provides a more transparent cost basis for the community and treasury.\n\n### **Beyond Storage: The Full Cost Landscape**\n\nOur pricing also factors in overhead for hosting and operational services such as **GCP, Cloudflare, Datadog, Onfinality, Dwellir**, plus Subscan’s own team efforts in **maintenance, development, and user support**. By pegging fees to storage usage, we ensure a straightforward, usage-based cost structure while continuing to deliver reliable, feature-rich explorer services to the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n### **Fee Details**\n\n#### **2025 Q1 & Q2 Maintenance Fee**\n\n#### <img height=\"144\" width=\"687\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXet0t9V6M3CyQiz9UAQgS8F6Usj8WMTeQ3EUp_WJ9t6icLmTs7mDFRw6kDegy-JylFqSzQTPZl-wiHC11YZVIK-472WneniRMKWAjMZmixWrbD7VsyVD_4ESakDadlDys5oCn1W1g?key=mqj-dLPW1cRI1b-JuozRQA\" />\n\n####\n\n#### <img height=\"152\" width=\"723\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcxN7fcy7SC-bhhHhCFO6sg5TTzJq0wcOlEbk8epvpbCf72-VL74-jQrqHrCtcRWovzb3F1mc58iaszCtGNIC9Mfsg69EMXtCHuqU3ny9C43zRX1LUPucewICS-BllAP1XsMVuRDg?key=mqj-dLPW1cRI1b-JuozRQA\" />\n\n<img height=\"464\" width=\"590\" src=\"https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc9YxGbs2OsiP2h5x-g_BoOjgq9VOT8AZ0XJajN8woTAAiPypOIFq6KkWJZqkNlFNXb6vGp8oGM0CdtgYKpuhSmTqsDDCNQ9ghHGPq61MVaVVdh5wwUID1zjkFFg2icIosdNXjB?key=mqj-dLPW1cRI1b-JuozRQA\" />\n\n| Network          | Actual Usage/GB | Date       | Package      | Fees/Month | Billing Period            | Fees  |\n| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------- | ----- |\n| Kusama           | 3339.15         | 14/02/2025 | Professional | 14574      | Q1: 01/01/2025-31/03/2025 | 43724 |\n| Kusama           | 3479.22         | 16/05/2025 | Professional | 15275      | Q2: 01/04/2025-30/06/2025 | 45825 |\n| AssetHub-Kusama  | 291.4           | 14/02/2025 | Basic+       | 1283       | Q1: 01/01/2025-31/03/2025 | 3850  |\n| AssetHub-Kusama  | 310.05          | 16/05/2025 | Basic+       | 1382       | Q2: 01/04/2025-30/06/2025 | 4146  |\n| Coretime-Kusama  | 57.17           | 14/02/2025 | Basic        | 799        | Q1: 01/01/2025-31/03/2025 | 2397  |\n| Coretime-Kusama  | 67.87           | 16/05/2025 | Basic        | 799        | Q2: 01/04/2025-30/06/2025 | 2397  |\n| BridgeHub-Kusama | 173.27          | 14/02/2025 | Basic        | 799        | Q1: 01/01/2025-31/03/2025 | 2397  |\n| BridgeHub-Kusama | 207.33          | 16/05/2025 | Basic+       | 837        | Q2: 01/04/2025-30/06/2025 | 2513  |\n| People-Kusama    | 44.79           | 14/02/2025 | Basic        | 799        | Q1: 01/01/2025-31/03/2025 | 2397  |\n| People-Kusama    | 61.36           | 16/05/2025 | Basic        | 799        | Q2: 01/04/2025-30/06/2025 | 2397  |\n\n* Total Maintenance Fees for 2025 Q1 & Q2 (5 networks): USD 112,043\n\n**Risk Assessment & Mitigation**\n\n* **Rising Storage Costs**: We employ automated data cleaning and indexing optimizations to prevent runaway growth.\n* **Security & Reliability**: Regular audits, real-time monitoring, and DevOps best practices minimize downtime and security threats.

      "content": "## Objective\n\nBloque aims to make Kusama the leading network for debit card issuance worldwide, starting in LatAm. Our success metric result for this project is $10M in monthly volume on Asset Hub. We have the network, the team, the metrics—and your trust.\n\n## We are a trusted team\n\nOur team we have shipped before the [#499](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/499) 30% faster with 20% more total payment volume in asset hub [(+$528K USD vs $440K USD )](https://assethub-kusama.subscan.io/account/CzQea4LtW8YWgwgYRMeRi64FgK2YVnWDGQkxa9SxcqPRq7W?tab=asset_change)\n\n\n## Summary proposal.\n\n**Bloque** has  launched an  open developer platform to issue layer 1 VISA  debit  cards on Kusama Asset Hub.\n\nThe requested funding allows us to build on the technical foundation to issue and distribute 20,000 physical debit cards over <ins>1 year</ins> to 20,000 new and KYC’d Kusama account holders. These new cards have its own account in Asset-hub and can spend KSM, dUSD and native tokens at any point of sale. instantly.\n\nThese new users will be onboarded through  trusted partners including: fintech platforms, construction companies, e-commerce merchants and street sellers throughout LatAm. \n\nWe project an average spend per card of $149 - $500 per month creating a monthly volume of $3.6M to $10m, we already moved ~~$440K~~ $528K USD on-chain in AH. (Why 500 USD, check the FAQ below)\n\nThis will generate 0.2% fees on every transaction for Kusama - $7.2K - $20k per month. \n\nFor developers you can issue debit cards to your users and earn up to 1.2% on every purchase they make. It’s a cost-effective, compliant, and growth aligned  way to boost your revenue while delivering real value to your community.\n\n## Why Kusama?\n\n- Kusama its a production ready blockchain underuse that is 8.22x cheaper:\n\n**Pure Proxy:** Kusama(0.0068 KSM) ~= 0.0941 USD vs Polkadot(0.2 DOT) > ~0.7 USD\n- Kusama receives faster upgrades, we benefit sooner from performance, security, scalability and Governance.\n- We made the first Kusama/Polkadot Meetup in LatAm in my previous startup Valiu, in 2020, i'm a true believer.\n\n## KYC/KYB Not required for DAOS\n\nWe’re building a legal framework that lets communities and individuals use debit cards without exposing personal identity. Our KYT‑driven compliance program reduces AML risks and allows DAOs and their members to access the traditional financial system while preserving privacy.\n\n## ZK Approach\n\nWe aim to enable ZK proofs in a later phase. Our manufacturer supports loading Java applets onto the card, enabling on‑card cryptography. We’re evaluating how to leverage this for privacy‑preserving verification, once we got confirmation we can share a plan with the community.\n\n## Demo\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/qqLcFk8k/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-1-59-54-PM.png)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mrfdBTdszSk)\n\n## AGG presentation\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/yY1kPhW4/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-1-51-15-PM.png)](https://x.com/TheKusamarian/status/1948171274305544209)\n[Link to slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zwY2wvwEJe74sSJnKGwI46vBdeIumZody3Tax6VNyY0/edit?slide=id.g3634ddf2cff_0_102#slide=id.g3634ddf2cff_0_102)\n\n## TL; DR;\n\n**Our team:**\n\n- Founding team from YCombinator.\n-  $2.5m USD Total Payment Volume to date.\n- +$400k USD on moved on Kusama AH currently.\n- Delivered the [#499 30% faster](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/499).\n\n**Proposal:**\n-  Expected $3.6 - $10m USD monthly volume in AH through 20,000 holders spending +$149-$500 per month. \n- Our north-star success metric is $10M USD in monthly volume.\n- 0.2% Transaction fees to Kusama (either burned or $7.2-$20k USD per month to treasury) \n- buy pressure with 0.1% purchase per debit card transaction in KSM for fees.\n- Developers can earn up to 1.2% of transaction fees by launching their own branded cards \n- Opportunity for branding on the card, which lead awareness of kusama. \n- Costs are for purchasing debit cards and for developer time.\n- Risk shared by Bloque team who are covering their own overhead (~$134K USD paid by Bloque,  $179K paid by Kusama).\n\n## Costs:\n\n#### Physical Card  Costs (107,707 USD) paid by Kusama : 60.1% of total Amount.\n- **Price per card:**3.04 USD x 20,000 = +60,800 USD [(You can check it in our contract here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2tmUvMkL-3Te4HhPEyCPBZG719KTgpA/view)\n-** Embossing fee:**+4,500 USD\n- **Colombian VAT:** 19% = 0.19  * (60,800 USD + 4,500 USD) = +12,407 USD\n- **Additional Visa Collateral:** +30K USD extra collateral for Visa processing transactions ahead of settlement.

In addition, the “debit callback” endpoint with 3D Secure prompts users to authorize (i.e., sign) transactions—effectively meaning the user “sells” crypto to us so that we can complete the payment on their behalf. Our security model is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing: at setup, the holder sends us one part of the secret while keeping the other part secure across multiple devices. When a transaction is authorized, the two parts are combined to complete the transaction.\n\n**How are redemptions processed?**\nToday’s redemption channels include Brale Rails (conversion across 10+ chains to USDT/USDC), a DEX liquidity pool for KSM/dUSD, and direct debit card transactions.\n\n**Do day-to-day COP inflation swings pose a risk?**\nYes, they can. To mitigate this risk, we maintain only small COP buffers in the bank while holding most of our treasury in USD.\n\n**How will the system mitigate potential volatility given that settlement can take several days?**\nLimiting USD buffer sales to twice daily (e.g., morning and afternoon) may expose us to unexpected volatility. Ideally, we offload USD as frequently as market conditions allow. When that isn’t feasible, we rely on compensation accounts, short-term COP buffer loans, SWIFT transfers, and OTC channels to quickly convert USD into COP liquidity.\n\n**How would a chargeback or clawback be handled?**\nFor same-day chargebacks—such as paying $5 with KSM for an Uber ride and then canceling—the system applies an adjustment credit by deducting $5 from the USD buffer, converting it to KSM, and crediting your account. For delayed clawbacks—like purchasing a $20 card with KSM on Temu but receiving a faulty product—we detect the issue via Visa’s invoices and balance sheets. In the next payment cycle, we net the amounts between our accounts; for instance, if we owe Visa $100 but receive $20, we pay only $80, converting the extra $20 into KSM and crediting your account.\n\n**Why 20,000 cards instead of 10,000 or 5,000?**\nPomelo minimum order is 10K physical cards,  For the range of 10K or 20K, our operative costs are the same, the unit costs operative cost per card is lower for 20K cards, so its optimal for RoI.\n\nFor 20K Cards = (134,760 + 72,000)/20,000 cards =  ~$10 USD.\nFor 10K Cards = (134,760 + 72,000)/10,000 card = ~$20 USD.\n\n**Why $149 - $500 USD per card?**\n[Please check our volumes projection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhy7ncYhbg5JCBA2FF4gWPu19VunMzIF_-nLyqIodq4/edit?gid=735485583#gid=735485583)",

      "userId": 3186,
      "content": "# **PolkArena: Revolutionizing Events for the Polkadot Era**\n\n## **Summary**\n\nWe propose to develop a comprehensive universal events portal specifically designed for the Polkadot ecosystem, serving as the decentralized amalgamation of Luma and DoraHacks while introducing unique on-chain features that will revolutionize how events/hackathons are conducted! This platform will fulfil the complete spectrum of event needs - from simple community meetups and networking sessions to sophisticated multi-track hackathons with integrated judging, funding, and project submission systems. By combining the user-friendly interface and broad appeal of mainstream event platforms with unique web3-native features, PolkArena will revolutionize how events are conducted and experienced.\n\nThe platform will serve as the premier destination for all Polkadot ecosystem participants - event attendees, organizers, developers, investors, and community members. Unlike traditional centralized platforms that charge significant fees (Luma charges 5% platform fees for paid events) and lack transparency, PolkArena will leverage Polkadot's infrastructure to provide unprecedented transparency, immutable records, utilisation of Polkadot-exclusive features and no-cost event management tools for Polkadot contributors and all the attendees of the ecosystem events.\n\n### **Why Kusama?**\n\nAs we develop the PolkArena in phases, we will be aiming to roll out the miniature event hosting portal first which will run on Kusama AssetHub’s PolkaVM, ready to use for the small scale meetups and non-hackathon events, way before the whole development scope is achieved.\n\n## **Project Overview**\n\n### **Vision**\n\nBuilding on our experience hosting the [AssetHub Hackathon](https://lu.ma/PolkaVM?period=past), we ([Edgetributor SubDAO](https://x.com/Edgetributors/) and [MontaQ Labs](https://x.com/montaqlabs)) identified the critical need for a unified, web3-native events platform that could handle everything from casual community gatherings to complex multi-day hackathons with sophisticated judging mechanisms and on-chain funding distribution.\n\nThe aim is to create the most advanced blockchain-native universal events platform that seamlessly integrates with Polkadot's infrastructure, serving as the decentralized equivalent of Luma while incorporating DoraHacks' sophisticated hackathon capabilities, especially the capabilities often missing from fragmented event management across different platforms.\n\n### **Core Value Proposition**\n\nUnlike traditional event platforms such as Luma (which offers basic event management with limited blockchain integration) or specialized hackathon platforms like DoraHacks (which focuses primarily on developer competitions), PolkArena will be the first platform to combine universal event management capabilities with deep blockchain integrations. Our solution will store critical event data on-chain on PolkaVM, provide native Polkadot tooling integration, and offer features specifically tailored to serve both the technical and non-technical members of the Polkadot community.\nEven competitor ecosystems lack such comprehensive on-chain event infrastructure. For example, while Solana has the Colosseum platform for hackathons, it lacks web3-native features and universal event management capabilities.\n\n### **Ecosystem Benefits**\n\n* **Universal Event Portal:** From 10-person meetups to 1000+ participant hackathons\n* **Blockchain-native Architecture:** Built on PolkaVM for enhanced performance\n* **Developer Onboarding**: Streamlined entry point for new Polkadot developers\n* **Innovation Catalyst**: Platform for showcasing cutting-edge Polkadot capabilities\n* **Community Growth**: Enhanced engagement through gamification and social features\n* **Talent Hub**: Go to place for talent identification, development, and ecosystem onboarding by anyone\n\n## **Feature Set**\n\n### **Unique Core Features:**\n\n* **On-Chain Data Storage**\n  * Event/hackathon details, configurations, and metadata stored immutably on-chain\n  * Registrations and check-ins\n  * Hackathon project submissions with cryptographic proof of timing and authenticity\n  * Participant feedback and judging scores with transparent tracking\n  * Complete project changelog history with version control on-chain\n  * Live scoring tracker with real-time updates and dispute resolution\n* **StorageHub Integration**\n  * Seamless project video and source code storage when StorageHub launches\n  * Decentralized file management with content addressing\n  * Automatic backup and versioning of project assets\n* **Developer Experience Tools**\n  * 1-click local pre-configured devnet deployment using chopsticks for rapid prototyping\n  * Chain state snapshot functionality for testing and development (tentative)\n  * Universal faucet integration supporting all Polkadot parachains\n* **Gamification & Learning**\n  * On-chain quizzes with verifiable completion certificates as NFTs\n  * Task-based leaderboards with skill progression tracking\n  * Side quests and assignments with automated validation\n  * Achievement NFT system for skill milestones\n* **Advanced Reward System**\n  * Native DOT distribution with programmable vesting\n  * Multi-token support (ERC20/ERC721/ERC1155) for diverse reward structures\n  * Automated prize distribution based on smart contract conditions\n  * Cross-chain reward compatibility through XCM\n* **Social & Collaboration Features**\n  * Grill Chat integration for decentralized communication\n  * AI-powered team matching based on complementary skills\n  * Mentor network with reputation-based matching\n  * Real-time collaboration tools with on-chain coordination\n* **Event Management**\n  * Integrated calendar with Luma API for seamless event scheduling\n  * Side event coordination with automatic notifications\n  * Cross-platform event synchronization\n  * Community-driven event discovery\n* **Recognition & Credentials**\n  * dotMemo integration for proof of attendance\n  * Skill-based achievement system with verifiable credentials\n  * Portfolio generation with project showcase capabilities\n  * Community reputation scoring with on-chain verification\n\n### **Additional Features:**\n\n* **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**\n  * Real-time participation metrics and engagement tracking\n  * Project quality assessment with AI-powered insights\n  * Ecosystem health monitoring and trend analysis\n  * Predictive analytics for hackathon success factors\n* **Cross-Chain Compatibility**\n  * Seamless integration with other Substrate-based chains\n  * Cross-parachain project deployment capabilities\n  * Universal identity management across the ecosystem\n* **Enterprise Integration**\n  * Corporate sponsor dashboards with detailed ROI tracking\n  * Advanced filtering and search capabilities for talent recruitment\n  * Automated compliance reporting and audit trails\n  * Custom branding and white-label solutions\n* **AI-Powered Features**\n  * Intelligent project categorization and tagging\n  * Automated code quality assessment and feedback\n  * Smart matching algorithms for optimal team formation\n  * Predictive prize allocation recommendations\n\n### **Technical Architecture:**\n\nThe platform will be built using a modular architecture that leverages Polkadot ecosystem's unique capabilities while ensuring scalability and maintainability.

That story is told live, weaving a web across a dancefloor of thousands, immersing it in the unified community and human possibility at the heart of Web3 - the profound synergy underpinning the partnership.\n\nThis is Kusama and Polkadot’s cultural layer — not a sponsorship, not a campaign, but a living, breathing act of radical culture that brings Web3 to life in the streets, in the sound, in the fire. It is a decentralised experience where the infrastructure is the medium and connection is the story.\n\n![Screenshot 2025-06-11 at 17.36.19.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQ2uhSN5bATM87JNuZW3ki2YkPY2tPk4PPQLWRpCwzXrh)",

      "content": "Introducing DotShield, a Web3-native bot designed to improve moderation, verification, and scam prevention in Telegram and Discord communities within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.\n\nCurrently, existing Telegram bots lack customizable Web3 verification, relying instead on captchas that are easily bypassed. While some Discord bots support Web3 verification, there is no Polkadot-native solution.\n\nDotShield solves this problem by enabling dynamic chain state verification, allowing groups to set their own desired criteria, such as balance thresholds and membership conditions, including but not limited to council membership, validator and other on-chain attributes.\n\n\n**Why This Matters**\n- Telegram & Discord groups are primary communication hubs for Web3 communities but suffer from spam, bot invasions, and scam attempts.\n- Existing bots do not use cryptographic verification for users, meaning scam bots can easily bypass security measures.\n- No Polkadot-native bot exists that integrates with the ecosystem for seamless verification.\n- Expanding DotShield ensures better security, community discussions, and fraud prevention across the entire Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n\n**The Story Behind DotShield**\nI've been a moderator/admin of several Telegram group chats and have been searching for an effective solution to combat spam and bot invasions for years. Existing solutions, such as Rose and Shieldy, rely on traditional Web2 captchas, which are no longer effective. Frustrated with the lack of viable options, I decided to teach myself how to code and build my own solution. After countless all-nighters debugging and researching, I finally created DotShield—designed specifically to meet the needs of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.\n\n\n**Core Features**\n- **Dynamic Chain State Verification**: Group admins can set criteria based on on-chain balances, governance roles, or other identity markers.\n- **Single Sign-In for Web3 Users**: No need to constantly sign transactions; DotShield seamlessly verifies users if they save their wallet as default.\n- **Flexible Moderation**: Admins can override verification, allowing them to manually add or remove members.\n- **Scam Prevention & Fraud Mitigation**: Dotshield is capable of implementing automated detection, user reporting mechanisms, and external scam database collaboration.\n- **Expansion to Discord**: Addresses the lack of a Polkadot-native verification bot for Discord, ensuring Web3 security across both platforms.\n\n\n**Funding Request & Milestone-Based Payment Structure**\nI am requesting treasury funding to support both the initial deployment and expansion to Discord. Payments will be structured as follows:\n\n1. **First Instalment** – Covers completed milestones (Telegram bot, core verification, UI, performance upgrades). **Total hours: 460**\n2. **Second Instalment** – After successful completion of Discord expansion and verification. **Total projected hours: 470**\n\n**Total hours: 930**\n\nI am seeking **USD$60/hr** to cover:\n- Development Server & Infrastructure Costs\n- Ongoing Maintenance & Feature Requests\n- Security & Scam Prevention Enhancements\n\n[**Full Proposal**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T30qpqw9mudbWZ9Y1Pr-jAs8hNblQiEFlSYhzlmKKeg/edit?tab=t.0)\n\n**Feedback**\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on how DotShield can be improved, whether additional features should be included, or if the funding structure needs adjustment.\n\n**Here’s a summary of recent user feedback**:\n- **Average Overall UX Rating**: 8.8 / 10\n- **Average UI Satisfaction (DotShield.app)**: 8.9 / 10\n- **Average Ease of Understanding Instructions**: 9.1 / 10\n- **Common Bug Reports**:\nMinimal bugs reported. Some mentioned minor onboarding issues, such as unclear steps for setting up a supergroup.\n\n- **Comfort Linking Wallets**:\nWhile some users expressed initial skepticism about connecting wallets (due to common web3 security concerns), many gained confidence thanks to positive community reputation.\n\n- **Transparency Requests**:\nUsers would like clearer communication about how DotShield handles data, including open-sourcing certain elements or publishing technical documentation to build further trust.\n\n- **Recommendation Likelihood**:\nThe majority of respondents would recommend DotShield to others, citing the value in protecting Polkadot ecosystem communities from scams and spam.\n\n- **Improvement Suggestions**:\n- Provide more detailed onboarding guides and user-facing documentation\n- Increase transparency around wallet connection and data handling\n- Enhance first-time user experience, especially for non-technical audiences\n\n- **Polkadot Ecosystem Adoption**:\nUsers are highly supportive of DotShield becoming a standard security layer across Telegram and Discord for the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n- **Likelihood to share with other community managers**:\nAverage score of 8.1 / 10\n\nHere are some group chats I’ve set up for testing purposes:\nhttps://t.me/DotShieldOfficial\nhttps://t.me/wndtester\nhttps://t.me/Polkadot_Sign_Only",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nI present this proposal on the authorization of the curators of bounty 25.\n\nThis proposal seeks to continue funding of Public RPC Providers for the period of six months plus an additional month's contingency. Funding is issued to bounty 25 which awards vendors for RPC services on the Kusama relay-chain as well as its system parachains. The total cost for such provision is USD$107,237.98, which represents $12,397.21 per month without contingency and administrative fees.\n\nBounty 25 adopts an tender based procurement model in which service providers bid on requirements as set-out by the curators. The tender requirements are aligned to ecosystem needs and can scale up/down depending on usage. Tenders are scored and the highest scoring providers receive funding.  \n  \nAttention is also being placed on quality of service and should service providers fail to meet said quality-standards they will be penalized or lose funding altogether.\n\nThis approach has seen a reduction with independent funding proposals for such services and steering of providers to a \"market rate\".\n\nFurther details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WV7n5HVKtO5s0ub6g4uEQAN4Y7SRNcu56QYFXPgN15I/edit?tab=t.0)\n\nKind Regards,  \nWill | Paradox | ParaNodes.io",

Its cloud-native, API-driven platform lets banks and fintechs launch secure, scalable cards rapidly. Partnering with Mastercard and Coastal Community Bank, Pomelo modernizes payments and drives financial inclusion.\n-   **Truora (KYC/KYB):** Truora is a Latin American startup simplifying user verification and fraud prevention. Its API-driven platform offers background checks, digital identity, and KYC tools to help businesses onboard customers securely, reduce fraud, and boost conversion\n-   **Bancolombia (Our Bank):** Bancolombia is Colombia’s largest bank, boasting 146+ years of trusted service. With 30M+ customers, extensive branch and ATM networks, and innovative digital solutions, it drives financial inclusion, supports sustainable growth, and champions economic progress across Latin America.\n\n### Meet our first customer\n\n[![](https://i.ibb.co/sd0gp7sF/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-17-02-55.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzP1vXJq7zQ&t=2714s&ab_channel=TheKus)\n\nwe introduced CocoWallet, building on the success of [CocoMercado](https://www.cocomercado.com/landing/), a remittance-based food service that’s supported Venezuela’s elderly through 7,000,000 expats. Now, CocoWallet is tackling financial exclusion in Colombia by launching debit cards with Bloque for the unbanked—and we’re bringing this to Kusama.\n\nOur goal is to onboard 3,000+ unbanked Colombians in the next few months. Here’s how we’ll do it on Kusama:\n\n-   **Decentralized Design:** Funds will be held in non-custodial wallets on Kusama’s Asset-Hub, with all debit card transactions pay fees in KSM. No banks, no centralized control—just user-owned value.\n-   **Kusama Benefits:** These 3,000 new users will become KSM holders, boosting adoption. Each card swipe will generate on-chain micro-transactions, increasing network activity and rewarding validators.\n-   **Scalability:** After this pilot, we’ll scale to 10,000 users across Latin America by 2025, funded by transaction fees but no endless treasury asks. Banks are obsolete. We want to drive a transformation that enables every organization to provide financial services—starting with a debit card. We aim to free finances for people, and to do this, we need your support.\n\n# FAQ\n\n-   **Why funding us?** We are an experienced team with a proven record of building Web3 products. Now, we want to use Kusama in everyday cases worldwide.\n    \n-   **Which regions are supported?** Mainly LatAm starting in Colombia & Mexico with worldwide availability via Passport.\n    \n-   **How will this API handle key material since the wallets are non-custodial?**  \n    We use a combination of proxy accounts with defined spending limits. In addition, the “debit callback” endpoint with 3D Secure prompts users to authorize (i.e., sign) transactions—effectively meaning the user “sells” crypto to us so that we can complete the payment on their behalf. Our security model is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing: at setup, the holder sends us one part of the secret while keeping the other part secure across multiple devices. When a transaction is authorized, the two parts are combined to complete the transaction.\n    \n-   **How are redemptions processed?**  \n    Today’s redemption channels include Brale Rails (conversion across 10+ chains to USDT/USDC), a DEX liquidity pool for KSM/dUSD, and direct debit card transactions.\n    \n-   **Do day-to-day COP inflation swings pose a risk?**  \n    Yes, they can. To mitigate this risk, we maintain only small COP buffers in the bank while holding most of our treasury in USD.\n    \n-   **How will the system mitigate potential volatility given that settlement can take several days?**  \n    Limiting USD buffer sales to twice daily (e.g., morning and afternoon) may expose us to unexpected volatility. Ideally, we offload USD as frequently as market conditions allow. When that isn’t feasible, we rely on compensation accounts, short-term COP buffer loans, SWIFT transfers, and OTC channels to quickly convert USD into COP liquidity.\n    \n-   **How would a chargeback or clawback be handled?**  \n    **_For same-day chargebacks_**—such as paying $5 with KSM for an Uber ride and then canceling—the system applies an adjustment credit by deducting $5 from the USD buffer, converting it to KSM, and crediting your account. **_For delayed clawbacks_**—like purchasing a $20 card with KSM on Temu but receiving a faulty product—we detect the issue via Visa’s invoices and balance sheets. In the next payment cycle, we net the amounts between our accounts; for instance, if we owe Visa $100 but receive $20, we pay only $80, converting the extra $20 into KSM and crediting your account.\n    \n-   **Whats the relationship with Virto?** BloqueDAO is a Virto-spinoff established as a self-governing DAO in Kreivo. We’re leveraging on the Kreivo technology to support non-custodial management of the funds every user tops-up in their Kusama Pay cards.",

Now, we want to use Kusama in everyday cases worldwide.\n    \n-   **Which regions are supported?** Mainly LatAm starting in Colombia & Mexico with worldwide availability via Passport.\n    \n-   **How will this API handle key material since the wallets are non-custodial?**  \n    We use a combination of proxy accounts with defined spending limits. In addition, the “debit callback” endpoint with 3D Secure prompts users to authorize (i.e., sign) transactions—effectively meaning the user “sells” crypto to us so that we can complete the payment on their behalf. Our security model is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing: at setup, the holder sends us one part of the secret while keeping the other part secure across multiple devices. When a transaction is authorized, the two parts are combined to complete the transaction.\n    \n-   **How are redemptions processed?**  \n    Today’s redemption channels include Brale Rails (conversion across 10+ chains to USDT/USDC), a DEX liquidity pool for KSM/dUSD, and direct debit card transactions.\n    \n-   **Do day-to-day COP inflation swings pose a risk?**  \n    Yes, they can. To mitigate this risk, we maintain only small COP buffers in the bank while holding most of our treasury in USD.\n    \n-   **How will the system mitigate potential volatility given that settlement can take several days?**  \n    Limiting USD buffer sales to twice daily (e.g., morning and afternoon) may expose us to unexpected volatility. Ideally, we offload USD as frequently as market conditions allow. When that isn’t feasible, we rely on compensation accounts, short-term COP buffer loans, SWIFT transfers, and OTC channels to quickly convert USD into COP liquidity.\n    \n-   **How would a chargeback or clawback be handled?**  \n    <ins>For same-day chargebacks</ins>—such as paying $5 with KSM for an Uber ride and then canceling—the system applies an adjustment credit by deducting $5 from the USD buffer, converting it to KSM, and crediting your account. <ins>For delayed clawbacks</ins>—like purchasing a $20 card with KSM on Temu but receiving a faulty product—we detect the issue via Visa’s invoices and balance sheets. In the next payment cycle, we net the amounts between our accounts; for instance, if we owe Visa $100 but receive $20, we pay only $80, converting the extra $20 into KSM and crediting your account.\n    \n-   **Whats the relationship with Virto?** BloqueDAO is a Virto-spinoff established as a self-governing DAO in Kreivo. We’re leveraging on the Kreivo technology to support non-custodial management of the funds every user tops-up in their Kusama Pay cards.",

Its cloud-native, API-driven platform lets banks and fintechs launch secure, scalable cards rapidly. Partnering with Mastercard and Coastal Community Bank, Pomelo modernizes payments and drives financial inclusion.\n-   **Truora (KYC/KYB):** Truora is a Latin American startup simplifying user verification and fraud prevention. Its API-driven platform offers background checks, digital identity, and KYC tools to help businesses onboard customers securely, reduce fraud, and boost conversion\n-   **Bancolombia (Our Bank):** Bancolombia is Colombia’s largest bank, boasting 146+ years of trusted service. With 30M+ customers, extensive branch and ATM networks, and innovative digital solutions, it drives financial inclusion, supports sustainable growth, and champions economic progress across Latin America.\n\n## Documentation\n\n-   [API Documentation:](https://api.bloque.app/docs/accounts) here you will find a preview in how it will work, you can create your own identities and also cards, if you want to test it please contact us.\n\n### Card Features\n\n-   Funds are non-custodial in Asset-hub.\n-   Top-up via dUSD via Polygon, Etherium, Asset-hub + 10+ chains.\n-   You can add this card to Apple or Google Wallet.\n-   Worldwide shipping for Physical Card.\n-   Cash ATM withdraws.\n-   As developer you can issue debit cards and earn up to ~1.3% from customers purchases cheaper, compliant and easier than ever before.\n\n### Benefits for Kusama\n\n-   All balances for the debit cards would be on-chain, ensuring transparency and increased chain volume.\n-   Calling all developers and builders! We're taking Kusama to new heights by partnering with more real world startups.\n-   Visa provides card infrastructure via Pomelo ([https://pomelo.la/es/](https://pomelo.la/es/)).\n    -   Our agreement with Pomelo is established in Colombia, but you can get access to the card worldwide (you only need a passport to verify your identity).\n-   Today, we want to support dUSD and KSM via Asset Conversions in Asset Hub.\n    -   In the future, we’ll be able to enable other coins/tokens created in the ecosystem to be used in daily use cases. For example, you could make a token in Asset Hub, create a pool (`YOUR_TOKEN/dUSD`), and then use that token to pay for your bus ticket.\n    -   With our customers and operation only, we will increase the volume on chain by ~700K USD monthly\n\n## How is it different from Polkadot Pay, Polkadot App or Nova Wallet debit card?\n\nActually, we're not competing —we're here to enable innovation. Think of us as an open API for debit card issuance for web3 projects, helping more projects/wallets/dapps to connect their users with their money. Here's what that means:\n\n-   **Integration Made Simple:** Our platform lets dapps and apps add debit card functionality without the heavy investments or operational overhead.\n-   **Building Together:** Instead of competing, we empower services to enhance their offerings. We provide the foundation, and you build on top of it.\n-   **Expanding Regional Reach:** We also support regional growth. For instance, if Polkadot Pay or Nova wants to extend their services into new regions like Latin America, our solution can simplify and accelerate that process.\n\nIn short, we're not here to replace existing services—we're here to support and enhance them. Our focus is on making it easier for any platform to offer debit cards, thereby driving innovation and growth across the board.\n\n[Here, If you want a more detailed comparison](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17uaTkqpwEgpUgVkM62S1K3YA4enlchwAciX3ni_jF7Y/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n## How far are we?\n\nWe have been working on the relationships and legal requirements to launch these debit cards for over a year; today, we’re in an advanced integration process for friends and family and with the regulatory requirements to do it.\n\n## **About us**\n\n-   [David Barinas:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbarinas/) CEO + Sr Engineer - Former YCombinator S19 Founder (Valiu 300K users + 6.2M raised).\n-   [Ole Tobias:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ole-tobias-lode/) COO + Product Managment - MSc in Technology Management, former Technology Consultant at Deloitte, and ex-COO of Efficence AS.\n-   [Roy Parrish:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roy-parrish-rippe/) Chief Legal Officer - LATAM & North America | Strategic Oversight of Compliance and Regulatory Affairs\n-   [Katherin Lopez:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angy-katherine-l%C3%B3pez-pr/) Head of User Research and Deals seeker / Ex Littio (YCS19) Ex Valiu (YCS19).\n-   [Luis Polania:](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-%C3%A1ngel-c%C3%B3rdoba-polan%C3%ADa-a1175a190/) / Head of Financial Operations Ex Littio (YCS23) Ex Valiu (YCS19).\n\n### Traction\n\n-   Today, our monthly volume is ~253K USD, which we plan to migrate to Kusama via dUSD.\n-   Startups will work with us until today:\n    -   [Coco Wallet YCS19](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/coco-wallet) 3.5K Users monthly [Link to LoI](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yOyvpNZvc043MvF61o6oppkY9rJ0gsqB/view?usp=sharing)\n    -   New Customers will be released and updated here soon…\n\n## Expenses Breakdown\n\n-   **45.7K USD** License = **30K USD x 19% Colombian VAT + 10K USD Collateral for Visa**\n-   **75K USD = 2.5K USD x 5 Members Full time x 6 Months**\n\n**Total:** 120.7K USD\n\n## Discussion Channel & Website\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us on our channel to discuss them with the community.\n\n-   [Join here](https://matrix.to/#/#kusama-pay:bloque.team)\n-   [Bloque Landing](https://www.bloque.app)\n\n## FAQ\n\n-   **Why funding us?**\n\nWe are an experienced team with a proven record of building Web3 products.

      "content": "> _Due to potential display issues with some charts in markdown format across various devices and platforms, please refer to the detailed information in this Google Document:_\n> \n> [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEoAbIrSm6ahkJHcDfpLrRFwxkgmDraUsA6m1nAK\\_Jo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FEoAbIrSm6ahkJHcDfpLrRFwxkgmDraUsA6m1nAK_Jo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSubscan is a comprehensive and widely-used explorer and indexer within the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem. It provides developers, validators, parachain teams, and general users with critical data insights—enabling efficient on-chain operations, debugging, and decision-making. We have previously received funding from the Kusama Treasury for infrastructure and development costs, ensuring that the platform remains stable, accessible, and continuously evolving.\n\n### **Past proposals**\n\n-   [**#229 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine (from July to December 2022)**](../referenda/229)\n-   [**#377 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Asset Hub (Kusama) Networks (from January 2023 to March 2024)**](../referenda/377)\n-   [**#434 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine Networks (from April to June 2024)**](../referenda/434)\n\n### **Overview and Rationale**\n\nIn earlier funding cycles, we relied on a reimbursement model closely tied to API usage and traffic distribution. This often resulted in cost volatility and estimation inaccuracies. To improve fairness, predictability, and transparency, we have refined our pricing model based on storage usage—an approach that correlates more reliably with total costs and has been successfully tested over the last year.\n\n**Encouraging Community Participation**  \nWe strongly value community feedback. Stakeholders can suggest new features, raise issues, and influence development priorities via our GitHub Issue Tracker:\n\n-   [https://github.com/itering/subscan-issue-tracker/issues](https://github.com/itering/subscan-issue-tracker/issues)\n\nIn the past, community feedback has led to UI improvements, enhanced token price display mechanisms, and more robust search functionalities. This iterative feedback loop ensures the ongoing alignment of our efforts with the community’s evolving needs.\n\n### **Scope of This Proposal**\n\n**Q2/Q3/Q4 Maintenance (5 Networks)**:\n\n-   Relay Chain: Kusama\n-   Public Parachains: AssetHub, Coretime, BridgeHub, People\n\nThese networks benefit from high-quality data indexing, stable uptime, accurate block and transaction data, NFT indexing improvements, and reliable APIs that developers and validators depend on daily.\n\n### **Cost Optimization and Historical Metrics**\n\nOur previous proposal for 5 networks over 3 months totaled approximately USD 41,230.47, averaging USD 13,743.49 per month. Through targeted optimizations—improving indexing algorithms, refining caching strategies, and consolidating infrastructure—our monthly average costs have decreased by about 14.12% for the Q2 , landing at approximately USD 11,803.33 per month.\n\n### **Benefits to Different User Groups**\n\n-   **Developers**: The enhanced APIs and improved indexing accuracy allow developers to more quickly access real-time and historical data, enabling them to build more reliable dApps and automation tools.\n-   **Validators & Parachain Teams**: Up-to-date block information, node health monitoring, and clear notification pipelines help validators maintain stable operations and quickly address issues. Parachain teams receive timely insights into network performance, asset transfers, and governance activities, facilitating better decision-making.\n-   **End-Users & Traders**: Subscan’s improved UI/UX, faster data retrieval, and more accurate token pricing empower end-users to confidently explore and evaluate chain data. Improved NFT module performance enhances the experience for users and creators alike, making the platform more accessible and engaging.\n\n### **Service Fee Model & Pricing Methodology**\n\nOur maintenance packages are designed to address a variety of data needs, ensuring smooth and efficient operations. Given the complexity of our overall cost structure—which includes expenses for GCP, Cloudflare, Datadog, Onfinality, Dwellir, and Subscan’s team operations—we use storage as the primary metric to determine fees. Storage usage strongly correlates with total costs and fluctuates as new blocks are produced. To maintain fairness and accuracy, we use the median storage value measured on the 15th day of each quarter to establish the quarterly baseline fee.\n\n**Pricing Tiers**:  \n**a. Basic Plan**\n\n-   Up to 200 GB: $799/month\n-   Beyond 200 GB: $5.3/GB\n-   Automatically upgrades to the next tier after 350 GB\n\n**b. Advanced Plan**\n\n-   Up to 500 GB: $1,699/month\n-   Beyond 500 GB: $5.2/GB\n-   Automatically upgrades to the next tier after 750 GB\n\n**c. Professional Plan**\n\n-   Up to 1 TB: $2,999/month\n-   Beyond 1 TB: $5/GB\n\n### **Monthly Service Fee Breakdown**\n\n**Database Storage & Indexing**\n\n-   **What It Covers**: Continuous indexing of on-chain data—from blocks and transactions to event logs, governance info, and NFTs—so users can reliably access both real-time and historical records.\n-   **Why It Matters**: As chain activity increases, so does data volume. By tying fees to storage needs, we accurately account for the costs of scaling infrastructure (e.g., additional database capacity).\n\n**Network Egress Bandwidth**\n\n-   **What It Covers**: The outgoing traffic required to serve user requests quickly and consistently, including API calls, UI data retrieval, and integrations with third-party tools.\n-   **Why It Matters**: A stable, high-bandwidth connection ensures that explorers, wallets, and dApps receive timely data responses, even during peak activity.\n\n**Monitoring & DevOps**\n\n-   **What It Covers**: Round-the-clock health checks, internal alert pipelines, CI/CD automation, and system auditing. This includes running multiple nodes, maintaining synchronization, and ensuring high availability.\n-   **Why It Matters**: These processes help detect issues early (e.g., node crashes, indexer slowdowns) and streamline updates or deployments, minimizing service disruption for the community.\n\n**Node Status Monitoring & Notifications**\n\n-   **What It Covers**: Dedicated tools and alert mechanisms to track the real-time status of network nodes—particularly those relating to the Kusama Relay Chain and the associated parachains (Assethub, Coretime, Bridgehub, People).\n-   **Why It Matters**: Quick notifications enable parachain teams, validators, and the wider ecosystem to react rapidly to performance changes, forks, or potential security incidents.\n\n**Technical Support & Troubleshooting**\n\n-   **What It Covers**: Responsive assistance for users, developers, and validators, including issue resolution, feature guidance, and integration help.\n-   **Why It Matters**: Timely support keeps the ecosystem running smoothly and fosters a positive development environment—especially crucial for teams building dApps, explorers, and automation tools.\n\n**Why We Use Storage as a Pricing Metric**\n\n-   **Correlation to Real Costs**: Storage growth scales in tandem with block production and transaction activity, making it a more stable metric than raw API traffic.\n-   **Quarterly Baseline**: By measuring the median storage on the 15th day of each quarter, we capture a fair snapshot of usage to determine the appropriate fee tier.\n-   **Predictable Billing**: This approach reduces wild fluctuations tied to sudden traffic spikes and provides a more transparent cost basis for the community and treasury.\n\n**Beyond Storage: The Full Cost Landscape**\n\nOur pricing also factors in overhead for hosting and operational services such as **GCP, Cloudflare, Datadog, Onfinality, Dwellir**, plus Subscan’s own team efforts in **maintenance, development, and user support**. By pegging fees to storage usage, we ensure a straightforward, usage-based cost structure while continuing to deliver reliable, feature-rich explorer services to the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n### **Fee Details**\n\n#### **Q2/Q3/Q4 Maintenance Fees**\n\n-   Total Maintenance Fees for Q2\\\\&Q3\\\\&Q4 (5 networks): USD 133,945\n\n| Network | Actual Usage/GB | Date | Package | Fees/Month | Billing Period | Fees |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Kusama** | 2406.62 | 15/05/2024 | Professional | 9912 | Q2: 01/04/2024-30/06/2024 | 29,736 |\n| **Kusama** | 2942.2 | 15/08/2024 | Professional | 12590 | Q3: 01/07/2024-30/09/2024 | 37,770 |\n| **Kusama** | 3120.73 | 15/11/2024 | Professional | 13483 | Q4: 01/10/2024-31/12/2024 | 40,448 |\n| **AssetHub-Kusama** | 205.08 | 15/05/2024 | Basic+ | 826 | Q2: 01/04/2024-30/06/2024 | 2,478 |\n| **AssetHub-Kusama** | 250.41 | 15/08/2024 | Basic+ | 1066 | Q3: 01/07/2024-30/09/2024 | 3,199 |\n| **AssetHub-Kusama** | 271.55 | 15/11/2024 | Basic+ | 1178 | Q4: 01/10/2024-31/12/2024 | 3,535 |\n| **Coretime-Kusama** | 10.75 | 01/06/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q2: 01/05/2024-30/6/2024 | 1,598 |\n| **Coretime-Kusama** | 28.94 | 15/08/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q3: 01/07/2024-30/09/2024 | 2,397 |\n| **Coretime-Kusama** | 46.35 | 15/11/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q4: 01/10/2024-31/12/2024 | 2,397 |\n| **BridgeHub-Kusama** | 108.36 | 01/06/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q2: 01/05/2024-30/06/2024 | 1,598 |\n| **BridgeHub-Kusama** | 121.9 | 15/08/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q3: 01/07/2024-30/09/2024 | 2,397 |\n| **BridgeHub-Kusama** | 141.82 | 15/11/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q4: 01/10/2024-31/12/2024 | 2,397 |\n| **People-Kusama** | 15.26 | 01/09/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q3: 01/08/2024-30/09/2024 | 1,598 |\n| **People-Kusama** | 28.12 | 15/11/2024 | Basic | 799 | Q4: 01/10/2024-31/12/2024 | 2,397 |\n\n### **Advertising Revenue & Offset**\n\nFrom August 6 to December 18, 2024, we tested advertising as a revenue source, generating USD 636.23. We will deduct this from our total requested amount to reduce the Treasury’s burden.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/3SWzqWG/kusama-ad.png)\n\nAds remain optional and user-controlled, and based on community feedback, we may refine or discontinue this approach. Users who opt-in may receive future benefits or premium features.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/ZJPYskf/close-ad.png)\n\n**Risk Assessment & Mitigation**\n\n-   **Rising Storage Costs**: We employ automated data cleaning and indexing optimizations to prevent runaway growth.\n-   **Security & Reliability**: Regular audits, real-time monitoring, and DevOps best practices minimize downtime and security threats. We remain responsive to any chain or protocol updates, ensuring compatibility and smooth operation.\n\n**Long-Term Sustainability & Vision**  \nOur long-term goal is to reduce reliance on treasury funding through multiple channels:\n\n-   Continuous optimization to limit infrastructure costs as chain data grows.\n-   Exploring responsible revenue streams (e.g., optional premium features or partnerships).\n-   Actively incorporating community suggestions to ensure value delivery aligns with user needs, increasing platform utility and potential monetization avenues without compromising openness or neutrality.\n\n### **Total Requested Amount**\n\n-   **Q2 \\\\&Q3\\\\&Q4 Operations: USD 133,945**\n-   **Subtract Advertising Revenue: -USD 636.23**\n-   **Total: USD 133,308.77**\n\n**We are requesting to make this payment using KSM EMA7 Price：**\n\n-   2024-12-30 03:00:00 (+UTC), Block #26425129\n-   KSM EMA7 Price ( USD ): 34.298126\n-   Number of KSM: 3886.765416\n\n**Conclusion**  \nThis proposal reflects our commitment to delivering stable, high-quality infrastructure and valuable features to the Kusama ecosystem. Through cost optimization, transparent reporting, continuous improvement, and a clear roadmap for future development, we strive to maintain the community’s trust and support. Our approach balances technical rigor, community engagement, and long-term sustainability—ensuring Subscan remains a cornerstone for the Kusama ecosystem’s data needs.\n\nA heartfelt thank-you to every one of our community members for the time, patience, and continuous feedback you’ve given. With your support, we can keep improving and make our community an even better place—together!",

It allows organizations to work better in a world that is becoming more connected and less centralized.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![virto app](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWLCnooSTpsLpN4HKyhuWKigp7f7m5wJGCbxPzyZ4571K)](https://www.loom.com/share/0f722d298377415ebd4b460aefd4d6e0?sid=4d0cdad0-2e2b-4587-a5c3-6011020989fe)\n\n### What to expect?\n\n-   Our focus for Q3 is to offer a polished end-user experience for members of DAOs to easily manage and participated in their organizations without the need for wallets or fees thanks to the abstractions built on the Kreivo parachain.\n\n> ## Call to action for Kusama and Polkadot\n> \n> We’re running a MVP program with on/off ramps providers in the Americas region to empower our organizations with digital debit cards to manage their expenses online and on/off ramps from KSM/DOT to USD in US and Colombian Pesos to pay salaries or perform deals with tranditional entities in the Region.\n> \n> If you’re interested please apply to the program here: [https://apply.virto.network/](https://apply.virto.network/)\n\n### The Virto Stack\n\nGoing forward we plan to evolve the experience we provide, putting together the tools we've built over the years into a unified solution: The _**Virto Operating System** for autonomous organizations_.\n\n![virto_stack.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfLYqP41sxNM3WNKwGWiWLtK1gznyK9hL387XjD3zQehk)\n\n## Links\n\n-   [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUG-UfeXDD3MK-hlwAwG-3o5Dp-B6wc7OvbGDdbeW98/edit)\n-   [Previous proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/439)\n-   [Product research insights](https://cotton-amber-2dd.notion.site/be82f1076ea0458e845e3323fd5916ba?v=60fa80d2a226442ab8f577b7bb73657d)(in Spanish)\n-   Post: [What is Kusama?](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/what-is-kusama-the-innovation-hub-of-polkadot/9931) (A vision for driving innovation)\n-   Post: [Sustainability model of a tokenless protocol](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/sustainability-model-of-a-tokenless-protocol/8683)\n\n## Virto FAQ\n\n-   **How does Virto keep track of its expenses?**\n\nAll treasury funds are kept on-chain using KSM, ensuring full transparency. This approach allows stakeholders to easily verify expenditures and maintains a clear, immutable record of all financial activities.\n\n-   **What defines productivity for the Virto team?**\n\nProductivity is measured by the strategic value provided to the Kusama ecosystem, rather than just the quantity of tools produced. This focuses on creating specialized tools that address critical needs within the network.\n\n-   **How much funding has Virto raised from the treasury?**\n\nApproximately $671,754 USD has been raised, with about $350,000 USD effectively available over 3 years due to market volatility, limited DEX liquidity, and tax obligations. This averages to roughly $120,000 USD annually for a team of 6-10 members.\n\n-   **How does Virto ensure accountability within its decentralized structure?**\n\nWhile maintaining flexibility for innovation, Virto is open to adopting clear milestones and deliverables. The team welcomes suggestions for improving accountability while balancing the needs of a decentralized project.\n\n-   **Is the funding request by Virto too ambitious?**\n\nThe funding request reflects the project's scope and ambition. It's designed to ensure continued significant contributions to the Kusama ecosystem, with potential long-term benefits justifying the current funding levels.\n\n-   **How to increase payments pallet adoption?**\n\nVirto is working on improving usability and maintenance of the payments pallet. Broader adoption is expected as the ecosystem evolves and the need for such tools becomes more apparent.\n\n-   **Should the Virto team take on more economic risk?**\n\nThe team has already taken considerable economic risk, including opportunity costs and personal resources. However, they're open to exploring hybrid models that balance community funding with self-sustainability.\n\n-   **Are documentation and usability issues hindering the effectiveness of Virto's tools?**\n\nEfforts are being made to improve documentation and usability, with some intentional delays to ensure API stability. The team acknowledges these areas as crucial for broader adoption.\n\n-   **How does Virto measure the success of its outputs?**\n\nSuccess is measured by the potential of tools and projects to shape the future of the Kusama ecosystem, not just by immediate usage. This considers the long-term impact of innovations that may be ahead of their time.\n\n-   **Is the current development structure of Virto effective for delivering meaningful results?**\n\nThe decentralized, flexible approach allows for innovation and adaptability. While open to adjustments, the team believes this structure is conducive to producing high-quality results in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.\n\n-   **Could a bounty system or self-funding model improve the project's outcomes?**\n\nA bounty system could align incentives with measurable results, but must be implemented carefully. The team is exploring various models to ensure alignment with Kusama's goals while maintaining innovation flexibility.\n\n-   **Why hasn't Virto developed a self-funded model for Kreivo's development?**\n\nDeveloping a self-funded model is complex in the evolving Web3 space. The Kreivo protocol is designed for self-sustainability(see linked post) and the Virto DAO is exploring ways to further monetize the underlying infrastructure.\n\n-   **How does Virto plan to ensure the long-term maintenance of its projects?**\n\nPlans are in place to gradually transition projects to more sustainable models, potentially involving collaborations with other ecosystem participants or through community-driven maintenance efforts. e.g. we have members in the Core Polkadot Fellowship and the Polkadot Tooling Collective that could fund parts of our stack in the future.\n\n-   **What steps is the Virto team taking to improve the usability of its tools?**\n\nThe team is actively enhancing user experience by refining interfaces, improving documentation, and incorporating community feedback. Usability improvements are an ongoing priority to make tools more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n-   **Why should the community continue to support Virto?**\n\nSupporting Virto is an investment in Kusama's mid-to-long-term success. The team is committed to learning from past experiences and improving to ensure future deliverables have a broader impact.\n\n-   **What value does Virto provide to the Kusama ecosystem that justifies continued funding?**\n\nVirto provides critical infrastructure and tools supporting the growth and development of the Kusama ecosystem and its organizations. These contributions are essential for the long-term health and expansion of the network.\n\n-   **How does Virto prioritize its development goals to align with the community's needs?**\n\nDevelopment goals are prioritized based on community feedback, strategic needs of the Kusama ecosystem, and the potential impact of each project.\n\n-   **Is the decentralized approach to Virto's development limiting its effectiveness?**\n\nWhile a decentralized approach presents challenges, it offers advantages in innovation and adaptability. The team believes this approach suits the Web3 space's demands but is open to introducing more structured elements if beneficial.\n\n-   **What safeguards are in place to ensure that Virto's funding is used efficiently?**\n\nRegular updates, community reviews, and detailed reporting on fund usage help ensure efficient resource use. The team is exploring ways to implement more robust accountability measures aligned with the project's decentralized nature.\n\n-   **How does Virto plan to increase the adoption of its tools and projects?**\n\nIncreasing adoption is a top priority, involving improving usability and documentation, active promotion within the community, collaboration with other projects, educational initiatives, and targeted outreach to demonstrate the value of Virto's contributions.",

It allows organizations to work better in a world that is becoming more connected and less centralized.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![virto app](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWLCnooSTpsLpN4HKyhuWKigp7f7m5wJGCbxPzyZ4571K)](https://www.loom.com/share/0f722d298377415ebd4b460aefd4d6e0?sid=4d0cdad0-2e2b-4587-a5c3-6011020989fe)\n\n### What to expect?\n\n-   Our focus for Q3 is to offer a polished end-user experience for members of DAOs to easily manage and participated in their organizations without the need for wallets or fees thanks to the abstractions built on the Kreivo parachain.\n\n> ## Call to action for Kusama and Polkadot\n> \n> We’re running a MVP program with on/off ramps providers in the Americas region to empower our organizations with digital debit cards to manage their expenses online and on/off ramps from KSM/DOT to USD in US and Colombian Pesos to pay salaries or perform deals with tranditional entities in the Region.\n> \n> If you’re interested please apply to the program here: [https://apply.virto.network/](https://apply.virto.network/)\n\n### The Virto Stack\n\nGoing forward we plan to evolve the experience we provide, putting together the tools we've built over the years into a unified solution: The _**Virto Operating System** for autonomous organizations_.\n\n![virto_stack.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfLYqP41sxNM3WNKwGWiWLtK1gznyK9hL387XjD3zQehk)\n\n## Links\n\n-   [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUG-UfeXDD3MK-hlwAwG-3o5Dp-B6wc7OvbGDdbeW98/edit)\n-   [Previous proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/439)\n-   [Product research insights](https://cotton-amber-2dd.notion.site/be82f1076ea0458e845e3323fd5916ba?v=60fa80d2a226442ab8f577b7bb73657d)(in Spanish)\n-   Post: [What is Kusama?](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/what-is-kusama-the-innovation-hub-of-polkadot/9931) (A vision for driving innovation)\n-   Post: [Sustainability model of a tokenless protocol](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/sustainability-model-of-a-tokenless-protocol/8683)\n\nHere's a markdown document with the questions and their respective answers:\n\n# Virto FAQ\n\n-   **How does Virto keep track of its expenses?**\n\nAll treasury funds are kept on-chain using KSM, ensuring full transparency. This approach allows stakeholders to easily verify expenditures and maintains a clear, immutable record of all financial activities.\n\n-   **What defines productivity for the Virto team?**\n\nProductivity is measured by the strategic value provided to the Kusama ecosystem, rather than just the quantity of tools produced. This focuses on creating specialized tools that address critical needs within the network.\n\n-   **How much funding has Virto raised from the treasury?**\n\nApproximately $671,754 USD has been raised, with about $350,000 USD effectively available over 3 years due to market volatility, limited DEX liquidity, and tax obligations. This averages to roughly $120,000 USD annually for a team of 6-10 members.\n\n-   **How does Virto ensure accountability within its decentralized structure?**\n\nWhile maintaining flexibility for innovation, Virto is open to adopting clear milestones and deliverables. The team welcomes suggestions for improving accountability while balancing the needs of a decentralized project.\n\n-   **Is the funding request by Virto too ambitious?**\n\nThe funding request reflects the project's scope and ambition. It's designed to ensure continued significant contributions to the Kusama ecosystem, with potential long-term benefits justifying the current funding levels.\n\n-   **How to increase payments pallet adoption?**\n\nVirto is working on improving usability and maintenance of the payments pallet. Broader adoption is expected as the ecosystem evolves and the need for such tools becomes more apparent.\n\n-   **Should the Virto team take on more economic risk?**\n\nThe team has already taken considerable economic risk, including opportunity costs and personal resources. However, they're open to exploring hybrid models that balance community funding with self-sustainability.\n\n-   **Are documentation and usability issues hindering the effectiveness of Virto's tools?**\n\nEfforts are being made to improve documentation and usability, with some intentional delays to ensure API stability. The team acknowledges these areas as crucial for broader adoption.\n\n-   **How does Virto measure the success of its outputs?**\n\nSuccess is measured by the potential of tools and projects to shape the future of the Kusama ecosystem, not just by immediate usage. This considers the long-term impact of innovations that may be ahead of their time.\n\n-   **Is the current development structure of Virto effective for delivering meaningful results?**\n\nThe decentralized, flexible approach allows for innovation and adaptability. While open to adjustments, the team believes this structure is conducive to producing high-quality results in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.\n\n-   **Could a bounty system or self-funding model improve the project's outcomes?**\n\nA bounty system could align incentives with measurable results, but must be implemented carefully. The team is exploring various models to ensure alignment with Kusama's goals while maintaining innovation flexibility.\n\n-   **Why hasn't Virto developed a self-funded model for Kreivo's development?**\n\nDeveloping a self-funded model is complex in the evolving Web3 space. The Kreivo protocol is designed for self-sustainability(see linked post) and the Virto DAO is exploring ways to further monetize the underlying infrastructure.\n\n-   **How does Virto plan to ensure the long-term maintenance of its projects?**\n\nPlans are in place to gradually transition projects to more sustainable models, potentially involving collaborations with other ecosystem participants or through community-driven maintenance efforts. e.g. we have members in the Core Polkadot Fellowship and the Polkadot Tooling Collective that could fund parts of our stack in the future.\n\n-   **What steps is the Virto team taking to improve the usability of its tools?**\n\nThe team is actively enhancing user experience by refining interfaces, improving documentation, and incorporating community feedback. Usability improvements are an ongoing priority to make tools more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n-   **Why should the community continue to support Virto?**\n\nSupporting Virto is an investment in Kusama's mid-to-long-term success. The team is committed to learning from past experiences and improving to ensure future deliverables have a broader impact.\n\n-   **What value does Virto provide to the Kusama ecosystem that justifies continued funding?**\n\nVirto provides critical infrastructure and tools supporting the growth and development of the Kusama ecosystem and its organizations. These contributions are essential for the long-term health and expansion of the network.\n\n-   **How does Virto prioritize its development goals to align with the community's needs?**\n\nDevelopment goals are prioritized based on community feedback, strategic needs of the Kusama ecosystem, and the potential impact of each project.\n\n-   **Is the decentralized approach to Virto's development limiting its effectiveness?**\n\nWhile a decentralized approach presents challenges, it offers advantages in innovation and adaptability. The team believes this approach suits the Web3 space's demands but is open to introducing more structured elements if beneficial.\n\n-   **What safeguards are in place to ensure that Virto's funding is used efficiently?**\n\nRegular updates, community reviews, and detailed reporting on fund usage help ensure efficient resource use. The team is exploring ways to implement more robust accountability measures aligned with the project's decentralized nature.\n\n-   **How does Virto plan to increase the adoption of its tools and projects?**\n\nIncreasing adoption is a top priority, involving improving usability and documentation, active promotion within the community, collaboration with other projects, educational initiatives, and targeted outreach to demonstrate the value of Virto's contributions.",

      "title": "Bounty top-up of the System Parachain Collators funding on Kusama",
      "content": "This is a proposal for a bounty top-up of the System Parachain Collators funding on Kusama. We are repeating this proposal since the referenda failed, in part due to last minute vote changed due to accusation of double spending. We hope to address this with this **[video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Mu2ouBdSsxntsmBtbh9uZzKDEEPNsqb/view)** and with the revised parts of the initial proposal. In addition - after the last proposal it was suggested that we elect a coordinator, which we did. Since Paradox has been doing this task for the past year he was suggested and endorsed as the coordinator. Furthermore - the market rate has since changed dramatically and we hope to be better aligned with the \"new market rate\" with the revised budget.\n\nThis funding will cover AssetHub, BridgeHub, Coretime, People and Encointer System Parachains on Kusama. This proposal supplements the original System Parachain Collator **[Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pRUj8WZPO75DuwDl4HoZU97v_Rmfx0bZ2KFqFW-qkE/edit)**, and continues the proposal for **[System Parachain funding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2T1Nx90HkSAYF_CaOPLG-o3LS7h_QAa2WLDdcSJMs0/edit)**, aiming to incentivize the best performance, minimize censorship, and maintain liveliness by securing treasury funding for the operational costs of Kusama System Parachain Collators. Furthermore it expands its scope to three new System Parachains — Coretime, People and Encointer. Additionally — it introduces newly established methodology of selection criteria for invulnerable collator spots, as well as newly established bidding procedure for securing permissionless spots. All of this is detailed out in the **[Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qURw3dLd2ioyBD3HocNC7AyuooY34k4X16WNYb0XidY/edit)** document.\n\n**Funding Request:** Infrastructure Costs and Staking Rewards **Coverage:** Five Kusama System Parachains (AssetHub, BridgeHub, Coretime, People and Encointer) **Duration:** 6-month runway **Start Date:** July 1, 2024 **Funding Amount:** 7,926.62 KSM for Kusama System Parachains\n\n**Note:** Unlike most other treasury spends, this spend funds a bounty. If there is a disagreement with any particular portion of the budget we can not disburse it or return that portion to the Treasury. There are also some budget items that are provisional (like development, price fluctuation, administrative) and these are all reallocated to primary services if not used for the intended purpose.",

      "content": "**Proponent**: DtrLdpbF7dP5bdcDhqMMtSFqywFKRjtuY9WHyx4JqYzaMgS\n\n**Date**: 2024/07/29-2024/11/20(Changed from 10/30 according to development time schedule)\n\n**Proposal Payment**: **_7,253 KSM($166,120)_**\n\n**Short description**: Mimir goes further by providing multisig users with features such as 1/N multisig, batch transactions, and staking. Additionally, it introduces a new account structure—Proxy accounts—filling the gap in the ecosystem for related applications.\n\n**Project Category**: Infrastructure/Dapp\n\n**Website**: https://app.mimir.global/\n\n**Full Proposal**: [Treasury Proposal: Mimir 2.0 - Multisig Optimize And Proxy](https://lvaum5an0ad.feishu.cn/docx/CwnCdvhRToXEbQx5GntcZeMjnTf?from=from_copylink)\n\nThis is a follow up proposal to what we submitted before.\n\nhttps://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/462\n\n# Concept\n\nMultisig ->https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-accounts-multisig\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/GabtzRP7rZuiMUd.png)\n\nProxy ->https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-accounts-proxy\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/rHo5POl9JpRbaYq.png)\n\n# Review\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/c8A34znIkO5NmiB.png)\n\n## Features\n\nThe Mimir team has successfully adapted the multisig functionality for the Polkadot ecosystem in the first phase of development. We have accomplished the following:\n\n1.  Creation of unlimited levels of nested multisig\n2.  Synchronization and management of transactions within nested multisig at any level\n3.  Onboarding of multisig users through third-party applications using the Mimir SDK\n\nThese features make Mimir a powerful multisig tool capable of meeting various complex needs. Whether the users are individual or institutional investors, regardless of the scale of fund management, Mimir can accommodate the vast majority of their multisig usage requirements.\n\n## Users\n\nIn this process, Mimir has created approximately 200 new multisig accounts and served over 1,000 addresses. Based on user feedback, some public chain projects are already using the Mimir wallet for account asset management. Additionally, some multisig-based DAOs are using the Mimir wallet for governance-related activities.\n\n**Trusted Partner**: Polkadot Mexcian, Mosiac\n\n## Network\n\nWe have successfully integrated with dozens of networks, covering most of the major networks within the Polkadot ecosystem:\n\n**Polkadot & Parachain**: Assethub, Bifrost, Crust, Pendulum, Acala\n\n**Kusama & Parachain**: Kusama, Bifrost Kusama, Amplitude, Karura\n\n**Solo Chain**: Vara, Crust\n\n**Testnet:** Rococo, Paseo\n\nMimir is the multisig wallet with the most network integrations within the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n## Application\n\nWe have also completed the integration of several applications, including:\n\n1.  Subsquare\n2.  Bifrost App\n3.  Crust Files\n4.  Polkadot JS\n5.  Polkadot Staking Dashboard\n\nMimir is the multisig wallet with the most application integrations within the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n## Social\n\nOn social media, our Twitter account has grown from zero to over 2,000 followers.\n\nWe have organized a total of 8 events in collaboration with networks, communities, and applications, with approximately 200 participants involved in these events.\n\n# Background\n\n## Multisig Optimize\n\n### 1\\. No application supports the creation of 1/N multisig\n\n**Data**\n\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem, 1/1 multisig accounts are currently the most common, making up 47% of all multisig accounts. Additionally, all 1/N multisig collectively constitute 62% of the total number of multisig wallets.\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/U6F9worazhKHOi4.png)\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/Qu5xeloivTpMhyN.png)\n\n**Problem**\n\nBased on the distribution in the Ethereum ecosystem, if we support 1/N multisig and implement other possible optimizations (such as adjusting deposit fees), the number of multisig accounts in Polkadot could potentially double.\n\nHowever, in the current Polkadot ecosystem, while Substrate's Multisig Pallet natively supports 1/N multisig, there are no existing multisig products that offer this feature.\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/CeSzfI7ZNksWOHc.png)\n\nThis limitation restricts the usage scenarios for multisig users, significantly raising the usage threshold for individual users. This is not conducive to the development of the ecosystem.\n\n### 2\\. The compatibility of multisig products for high-frequency extrinsic is low\n\n**Data**\n\nBatch and staking are the transaction types we have identified as the most common after transfers. However, in the Polkadot ecosystem, no products other than Polkadot.js have been developed to handle these types of transactions effectively.\n\n![](https://s2.loli.net/2024/07/29/QPkBfrvbgcdE3VS.png)\n\n**Problem**\n\nCurrently, none of the various multisig or extension products in the Polkadot ecosystem offer a similar application that can visually cache the transactions users wish to execute. When users need to perform a transaction, they can select the relevant transactions from the cache page and initiate them in a bundled manner.\n\nThe staking module is a common operation, and while Polkadot has developed a Staking Dashboard App for this purpose, it still does not support multisig accounts.\n\nThis means that when users need to send assets in bulk or perform advanced DeFi operations, they lack effective tools. This limitation inevitably restricts the development of ecosystem applications. Many DeFi functions that are achieved through composability in other ecosystems have very high operational thresholds in the Polkadot ecosystem. This also restricts the design of applications on the product side, preventing the full release of the ecosystem's potential.\n\n### 3\\. No multisig solution provides cross-chain check capabilities\n\n**Data**\n\nFrom June 1 to July 1, there were a total of 862,597 cross-chain XCM transactions within the Polkadot ecosystem. With the opening of the Kusama and Polkadot <> Ethereum bridges, cross-chain interactions will see even more practical use cases.\n\n**Problem**\n\nPolkadot emphasizes cross-chain information interaction, but cross-chain operations still involve significant uncertainty and risk for users.\n\nWhen users perform cross-chain operations, they typically need to select an address on the original chain and an address on the target chain. If they choose a non-existent address on the target chain, it will inevitably lead to asset loss. This is particularly problematic for Pure Proxy accounts, which only exist on one chain. Without proper security prompts, cross-chain operations can easily result in asset loss.\n\nImplementing such safety checks independently within each app that executes cross-chain transactions can be complex. Therefore, Mimir can intercept and prevent such risky actions when users submit transactions, ensuring these issues are avoided.\n\n## Proxy\n\n### 1\\. No application supports operations for proxy accounts\n\n**Data**\n\nIn the Polkadot and Kusama networks, 1,594 accounts have delegated some of their permissions to other accounts. The number of multisig accounts in the Polkadot network is 1,148, while in the Kusama network, the need for user-friendly proxy account operations is even greater, given that there are only 417 multisig accounts.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nWhen users want to enhance their account security level or operational convenience, Proxy Accounts become their best choice.\n\n**Ordinary Proxy**: Proxy establishes a relationship between two accounts. The Proxied Account delegates some of its authority to the Proxy Account, allowing it to perform certain operations on its behalf. The delegated authority can include Any, Non-Transfer, Governance, Staking, Auction, etc.\n\n**Pure Proxy**: Unlike Proxy, which establishes a relationship between two existing accounts, Pure Proxy is a process of creating a new account. Once executed, it creates a new Proxied Account that is not controlled by any private key and can only be controlled by the Proxy Account.\n\n**Problem**\n\nIn the current ecosystem, Proxy is a more common security account management solution than multisig. However, there are no user-friendly tools for managing Proxy accounts.\n\nCurrently, only Polkadot.js allows for the delegation and authorization of Proxy accounts, which is not user-friendly for newcomers. Especially, the combination of Proxy and multisig accounts can meet most fund management needs. For example, managing funds with multisig and delegating the Non-Transfer permissions of the multisig account to a extension account for daily staking maintenance and governance participation.\n\nTo attract more users, a more productized solution is needed.\n\n### 2\\. No application supports the delayed proxy feature\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSmart Account is a crucial concept in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling accounts to have richer functionalities, such as delegation and small-amount payments without verification. This gives Safe a significant advantage over other multisig accounts.\n\nIn the Polkadot ecosystem, Substrate natively supports Delayed Proxy. This feature allows a Proxy Account to propose a transaction that goes through a Review Window. During this period, the Proxied Account can cast a veto vote against the proposal. If the Proxied Account completes the veto vote, the transaction is canceled. If there is no veto, the transaction executes after the Review Window ends. This feature enables several functionalities:\n\n**Account Recovery**: The Proxied Account is a multisig account, and the Proxy Account is a trusted third party. If a member of the multisig loses their private key, the trusted third party can reset the members.\n\n**Optimistic Governance**: The Proxied Account is a multisig account, and the Proxy Account is an active governance participant. When new proposals arise, the Proxy Account can present its opinions. If there are not enough vetoes, the proposal executes according to the governance participant's suggestion.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe delay functionality is indeed powerful, but its practical impact in the current ecosystem is quite limited. The reason lies in the lack of productized solutions.\n\nThis solution requires not only setting up the delay but also managing the full lifecycle of these transactions, as well as matching the interaction pages to the corresponding roles, such as distinguishing the usage strategies of Proxy Account and Proxied Account.\n\nHowever, currently, no product can achieve this.\n\n## Watch-Only Mode\n\n### 1\\. No application supports the Watch-Only feature for multisig accounts\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem, Safe allows users to access any Safe-based multisig account to view its asset status, historical transactions, current transaction records, and module configurations.\n\nThanks to the public and transparent nature of blockchain technology, users are highly motivated to monitor large accounts, track project asset activities, and ensure these projects are adequately supervised.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThe complexity of obtaining asset and member information for multisig accounts is significantly higher than for extension accounts. Currently, there is no application in the ecosystem dedicated to tracking multisig accounts.\n\nLarge projects typically manage their funds through multisig accounts. Without effective asset tracking tools, the transparency of the ecosystem is compromised, leading to reduced decentralization.\n\n# Ecosystem Fit\n\nMimir's product design philosophy is to enhance user experience by providing more user-friendly products rather than creating more underlying technology. In the Polkadot ecosystem, the underlying technology is very powerful; Substrate's Pallet can achieve almost any function. However, presenting these capabilities to users is something Parity hopes to encourage community developers to accomplish through treasury funding.\n\nFrom Multisig to Proxy and Batch, Mimir has always been dedicated to presenting these features in a more user-friendly way. We use data analysis to understand users' real needs, optimizing and iterating on our products to contribute to the prosperity of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n## A more diverse account structure can attract a wider range of users.\n\nSubstrate's account system is richly designed to meet the diverse needs of various blockchain participants.\n\n**Normal Multisig**: Ideal for whales, project teams, DAOs, and traditional institutions, it enables secure fund management.\n\n**1/N Multisig**: Allows regular users to separate asset accounts from operation accounts at a lower cost and with simpler operations.\n\n**Proxy Accounts**: Can be combined with normal multisig to delegate powers such as staking and governance to specialized operators, improving fund handling efficiency.\n\n**Pure Proxy**: Offers enhanced privacy and censorship resistance.\n\n**ChaosDAO**:\n\nChaosDAO's governance integrates multisig and Pure Proxy. Member votes are collected off-chain and then voted on-chain. An emergency committee proxy can modify votes in special circumstances.\n\n**Project Teams**:\n\nProject teams typically use multisig for overall fund management and delegate staking powers to dedicated finance personnel. This significantly enhances efficiency when maximizing asset returns.\n\nAs the ecosystem evolves and with the advent of Polkadot 2.0 and a potential cryptocurrency bull market, Polkadot's market value is expected to grow. The increasing demand for fund management within the Polkadot ecosystem requires effective multisig and proxy solutions. Without these, the entry barrier will rise significantly, hindering ecosystem development.\n\nMimir aims to simplify the creation of complex account models that meet diverse needs. By providing productized solutions, Mimir enables users to build sophisticated account structures tailored to various scenarios with ease.\n\n## More convenient transaction features can provide users with a better experience\n\nIn the Ethereum ecosystem, various tools assist with complex account transactions. Safe supports a range of sophisticated transaction tools, such as adding transactions to a batch and using a Transaction Builder. Additionally, Safe's Smart Account modules provide multisig accounts with greater flexibility and extensibility.\n\nIn the Polkadot ecosystem, Substrate also natively supports many of Safe's flexible transaction features. For example, the Utility module includes batch-related functions, and the Proxy Delay feature can implement capabilities like Recovery and Spend Limits.\n\n**Transaction Cache**\n\nAssembling a single transaction or multiple transactions can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, especially for recurring tasks. Mimir's Transaction Cache feature helps users store pending transactions for batch management. Combined with the Watch-Only feature, users can observe operations on other accounts and replicate transactions based on Transaction Hash, enabling them to follow KOLs and influencers' actions to improve their own returns.\n\n**Optimistic Proposals**\n\nUsing Delayed Proxy, governance organizations can benefit from optimistic proposals. A member with a deep understanding of governance can prioritize voting according to their preferences. Other members can object during the Review Window. If there are insufficient objections, the proposal is executed according to the member's opinion, improving governance efficiency and shortening processes.\n\nConvenient transaction features can significantly enhance the user experience within the Polkadot ecosystem, increasing the variety and richness of transactions and bringing more surprises to the community.\n\n# Milestones\n\n## **Objectives**\n\nThe focus of this version update revolves around the following aspects:\n\n  1. **Multisig Optimization**\n\n  - **Adaptation for 1/N multisig**\n\n  - Creation of 1/N multisig\n\n  - Automatic filling of zero address\n\n  - Modification of members for 1/N multisig\n\n  - Processing transactions for 1/N multisig\n\n  - **Transaction Cache Feature**\n\n  - Transaction Cache sidebar\n\n  - Transaction save entry\n\n  - Transaction copy functionality\n\n  - Importing transactions via hash/browser link\n\n  - **Staking Dashboard Adaptation**\n\n  - Local deployment of the Staking Dashboard\n\n  - Support for Mimir SDK adaptation\n\n  - **Multisig/Proxy Cross-Chain Transfer Monitoring**\n\n  - Safety Check Module\n\n  - Transaction Block\n\n  2. **Proxy Account Adaptation**\n\n  - **Normal Proxy Accounts**\n\n  - Proxy relationship binding process\n\n  - Proxied account usage process\n\n  - Mimir SDK compatibility\n\n  - Proxy account permissions check\n\n  - Integration of proxy and multisig relationships for unified display\n\n  - **Pure Proxy Accounts**\n\n  - Creation process for Pure Proxy accounts\n\n  - Adaptation of management processes for Pure Proxy accounts\n\n  - Distinction between Pure Proxy accounts and Flexible Multisig accounts\n\n  3. **Watch-Only Accounts**\n\n  - Address/public chain-based routing configuration\n\n  - Interaction for adding Watch-Only accounts\n\n  - Watch-Only permission rules\n\n  - Synchronization of Watch-Only accounts with local accounts\n\n# Budget\n\n## Working Hour and Fee\n\n[Detailed Information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZzB7nQpsYx-2IZ3S5LNvWUC1lcpwiD-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101976453912034942917&rtpof=true&sd=true)",

      "content": "**Budget on rewards for content creators, chat moderation, anti-scam activity and events for 1 year**\n\n**Proponent:** ETdYaUAqUWTTA6hXm9edwDWEn6iBYaRK2mJCUwaKQzfqQYS  \n**Date:** 10 May 2024  \n**Requested allocation:** 5555 KSM (approximately 160K$ or 13,33K$ per month)  \n**KSM 7D EMA according to Subscan:** $28.862  \n**Proposed Curator reward:** Specified in section 4.2  \n**Short description:** A year-long bounty to increase the education, awareness and presence of Polkadot & Kusama in the Russian-speaking community by producing content, hosting events, maintaining related chats and anti-scam activity.\n\n**Context of the bounty**\n\nThe Russian-speaking community is one of the most active and vibrant in the whole Web3. However, interest in the Russian-speaking Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem has seen a significant decline due to a lack of enthusiasts and content. We aim to change that by introducing a bounty specifically for the Russian-speaking community.\n\nMore than 250 million people around the world speak Russian, with Russian-speaking countries consistently ranking among the top nations by global cryptocurrency volume. Furthermore, a significant number of Russian-speaking developers are contributing to the development of the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem.\n\nWhy we focused on Kusama Treasury? We see huge untapped potential in Kusama, being Polkadot's canary sister and truly community driven, Kusama has the potential for massive growth in terms of new projects, liquidity, and users—especially following the main bridge launch and full integration with Polkadot. One of the main priorities of this bounty is to enhance the visibility of Kusama.\n\nWith this Bounty, we want to breathe a second life into the Russian-speaking community, inspire and encourage individuals to contribute to the ecosystem, and ensure that community members receive quality and relevant content. Moreover, one of our top priorities is to attract community members that are currently outside of the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem.\n\nOur bounty is designed not only to incentivize active ecosystem enthusiasts and community members, but also to bring new members, educate about Polkadot tech, engage with crypto influencers, and establish partnerships.\n\nBased on the experience of colleagues from other regions, as well as on the peculiarities of our region, we decided to divide the Bounty into 4 sections:\n\n**—  Russian-speaking content.** To address the lack of quality, reliable and relevant content, we want to incentivize content creators to start contributing to the ecosystem on an ongoing basis. By contributing to the ecosystem, we mean translation of key Polkadot & Kusama news and updates into Russian, and the production of audio-visual and textual content in Russian.  \n**—  Chat moderation and maintenance.** In this section, we want to solve the problem of the abandoned Russian-speaking channel on the official Polkadot Discord server and support the current moderators in Polkadot & Kusama Telegram chats, which work on full enthusiasm.  \n**— Event hosting**, as a very important part of community building, so we want to give passionate community members the opportunity to host local events without worrying about the troubles they would have to face when requesting funds from the treasury.  \n**— Anti-Scam activity**. Preventing scam, phishing attacks, and other destructive and harmful activity in the Russian-speaking community. Delivering information about these attempts to main Anti-Scam team in order to collaborate and prevent these activities from occurring. Curators will take the lead in this area of work, ensuring that we are always aware of any new threats and taking appropriate measures to protect our users.\n\nСurators selected for the Content Production and Event Hosting sections are responsible for reviewing the related submissions. The quality of the submission is evaluated on a point system, and the amount of rewards for contributors is directly related to the number of points received for the submitted work.\n\n**Problem statement:**\n\nNo incentive to produce content: Despite all the advantages that OpenGov offers, it is almost entirely focused on contributing in English, making it almost impossible for a Russian-speaking content creator to get funding.\n\nAn unpresentable view of Polkadot & Kusama in a Russian-speaking environment: Due to the lack of content, translations of latest updates, and an abandoned Russian-speaking Discord channel, potential Polkadot & Kusama users may have a wrong impression of the ecosystem.\n\nLack of offline activities: Without funding, growth and development of offline events are impossible. This also affects participation in major Russian-speaking cryptocurrency conferences.\n\nLack of interest from companies in Russian-speaking countries towards Polkadot & Kusama: A low presence and an inactive community can influence decision-making regarding Polkadot & Kusama and negatively impact deal closings.\n\n**Submission information**\n\nWe expect all contributors participating in the Bounty to follow the rules below:\n\n**Be original:** The content you submit must be original and preferably reflect your own unique style.  \n**Be respectful:** We do not support content that offends or discriminates against any social groups.  \n**Be truthful:** Ensure all information in your content is accurate and not misleading curators and community.  \n**Be responsible:** Take responsibility for the quality of the content you create.  \n**Be proactive.** Stay updated with the Bounty's progress and actively engage in content creation.\n\nThis proposal divides the scope of submissions into the following categories:\n\n— Creation of Russian language audiovisual content  \n— Creation of Russian language writing content  \n— Translation of content and updates into Russian  \n— Organization of events oriented to the Russian-speaking community\n\n[For more details please read the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18mIh2WMMWlv2j3VLO44tP2RVp1mEwBbh9hmhWgwjEW8/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Asset Hub (Kusama) Networks (from January 2023 to March 2024)",
      "content": "> This is a follow-up proposal to what we submitted before:\n\n[#229 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine (from July to December 2022)](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/229)\n\n> This is also a re-submission of Referendum 316:\n\n[#316 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine Networks (from January to September 2023)](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/316)\n\n\n## Overview\n\nSubscan serves as a vital block explorer and analytics tool within the Substrate ecosystem, offering valuable insights to its community. However, maintaining and operating Subscan demands significant resource investments, encompassing server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Thus, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fees for Subscan from January 2023 to March 2024 from the Kusama treasury, ensuring its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\nWe highly prioritize feedback from our community users. In Q3 2023, we made substantial efforts to reduce infrastructure costs, yielding effective and gratifying results. Operational expenses gradually decreased starting from July 2023 and have recently stabilized. As an example, our GCP bill for September 2023 decreased by more than 50.52% compared to its historical peak.\n\nIn this re-submission, we appended billing information covering October 2023 through March 2024. While ongoing block production growth naturally increases GCP expenses, we managed to moderate this increase, ensuring slow and predictable billing growth over the recent half-year. Particularly noteworthy is the March 2024 bill, significantly lower than its March 2023 counterpart despite the elapsed year, showcasing the substantial efficacy and enduring benefits of our Operations and Maintenance Cost Reduction Plan.\n\n## Re-submission Details\n\nFollowing the rejection of [Referendum 316](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/316), we diligently reviewed and implemented optimization strategies suggested by the community. Data from the past 9 months demonstrates that these measures have been highly effective, making future costs more predictable.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Kusama network has not covered any costs for Subscan for 15 months, posing a significant financial challenge for our team. The substantial cost shortfall has us concerned about our future. Should this proposal not be approved, we may need to consider pausing the development of new features for the Kusama network, potentially impacting the ecosystem negatively—an outcome we earnestly wish to avoid.\n\nWe appeal to the Polkadot community for support in this proposal. Our commitment to enhancing and maintaining the infrastructure remains steadfast. By securing the necessary funding, we can continue our work without interruptions or compromises, ensuring the robustness and innovation of the ecosystem.\n\n**View detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kGJIExM-rzPGucsExHqxFkqV5etZBwCVWcDn08ae-f8/edit?usp=sharing).**",

I discussed these on [AAG  #119](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CK0co2NNjs0). The purpose of these bounties is to form proto-collectives around ideas in principle. By creating these bounties and segregating this funding it does the following:\n\n1) Shows that the community supports an idea in principle which should incentivize people to work toward that idea.\n2) Allows us to have discussions on structure and mechanisms at a later date\n3) It reduces the burn on the treasury (We have burned $1.5M on kusama in the last year alone). By putting 50% of the treasury into bounties based on ideas in principle, we reduce the burn rate by 50%. \n\nStake Plus will not be involved in any of these proto-collectives as either curator or as a member. These are ideas that I've (Tom) had rolling around in my brain and thought I would shoot them out. I look forward to seeing ideas presented by other agents.\n\nIf there is a person or team interested in leading this collective, they should put together a proper proposal and apply with that idea along with a full set of curators using the bounty.proposeCurator() extrinsic. If no one steps forward, at minimum we're reducing the burn and these funds can be reaped back to treasury in the future.\n\nThe provided proposal document is meant to be a framework of how I was approaching the idea.\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n\nThis proposal seeks to establish a proto-collective tasked with auditing historical deliverables of Polkadot treasury proposals, ensuring proponents meet their obligations and safeguarding the treasury's assets. It will enable up to 50 independent ecosystem agents to join, with 4 auditors randomly selected for each audit to assess deliverables and generate transparent, JSON-integrated reports for ecosystem-wide governance enhancements.\n\nProposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sqduurq5GmijupCPSl5W5LwM56O6KrftB5EFM5261Qk/edit?usp=sharing",

Due to their pivotal role and high transaction volumes, they have simultaneously become a hotspot for malicious activities. When exploited, these breaches can lead to significant impact including financial losses.\n\nThis proposal aims to ensure the utmost security of the bridges and promote community involvement by implementing a Security Bug Bounty Program. While all developers involved work hard to ensure the software and protocols built are bug-free, secure by design, and third-party code audits have been already performed, it is recognised security best practices to complement this. That’s why Polkadot and Kusama need community and bug bounty hunters to help to identify security vulnerabilities that could cause impact from all the severity levels before it is widely used and adopted.\n\nTo support this, the Bug Bounty participants are provided with many context details in the full proposal [attached](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rzvoJxMVIG1MJfHCkHDLmXYBTlkJZvUgwsP4IV4oHKw/edit), including a threat model of the scope.\n\nAs a security vulnerability in the bridge can impact both the source and destination blockchains, a mirror bounty is raised on Kusama and Polkadot\n\nThanks for your time and support to make Polkadot more secure !\n",

      "title": "Bounty Proposal for Public RPCs for Relay and System Chains",
      "content": "*This is a joint-proposal by BlockOps, Dwellir, LuckyFriday, OnFinality, RadiumBlock, RockX, and Stakeworld. Valuable input to this proposal has also been made by the proposed curators.*\n\n### **TL;DR:**\n\nThis proposal outlines a procurement strategy for public RPC services in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, aiming for high-quality, decentralized, and cost-effective services. It addresses the vital need for reliable RPCs, emphasizing their role in applications like Polkadot.JS and wallets. The strategy focuses on optimizing quality of service, sustainable cost, and decentralization, introducing key definitions and standards. Tenders from RPC providers can follow two models: cost targets or predefined service levels. The proposed budget is $400,000, split between Polkadot and Kusama treasuries.\n\n### **Introduction**\n\nThis proposal aims to implement a procurement strategy for public RPC services in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. The goal is to ensure high-quality, decentralized, and cost-effective services for essential applications like Polkadot.JS and wallets. The need for robust public infrastructure was emphasized during Polkadot Decoded discussions.\nProblem Statement\n\nReliable public RPC services are crucial for the growth of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Existing applications, such as Polkadot.js.org and Nova Wallet, require optimal functioning for an enhanced user experience. The proposal addresses the challenge of balancing service provision with sustainable treasury spending. It acknowledges the evolving role of light clients and the continued need for RPCs and bootnodes.\n\n### **Proposed Strategy**\n\nThe procurement strategy aims to optimize quality of service, sustainable cost, decentralization, and simplicity. Key definitions, such as curators, independent RPC monitoring, system chains, and qualified RPC providers, are outlined. Quality of Service Reports and Service Agreements form essential components, with predefined standards and penalties for non-compliance.\n\n### **Tender Submission and Evaluation**\n\nA transparent process is proposed for RPC providers to submit tenders, with defined standards of service. Two potential options for tenders are presented: one focusing on cost targets and the other on predefined service levels. The curators, responsible for evaluation, scoring, and public announcement of selected providers, will ensure transparency and community involvement.\n\n**Operations Phase**\n\nRPC providers awarded service agreements are obligated to provide services throughout the six-month operations phase. Independent RPC monitoring will assess performance, and metrics will be made public. Providers will be paid monthly in arrears based on the EMA7 day average price of DOT/KSM.\n\n### **Budget and Costings**\n\nThe proposed budget for the program is $400,000, providing a 12-month runway for assessment. Funding will be split between Polkadot and Kusama treasuries, with curator payments of $350 per month from the Polkadot portion. The budget accounts for potential quarterly expense variations based on traffic and evolving requirements.\n\n**Read the [full proposal here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GS4D95fkNjpi9GbXsiW7-9WOeGb30M5CYXEHXWsWRaw/edit)**\n\nWe are excited to share this proposal and are eager to hear your thoughts and feedback. Please feel free to comment, share your insights, and make suggestions to help refine this proposal further.\n\nThis proposal has been put forward by the following members of the RPC community:\n\n[BlockOps](https://blockops.network/), [Dwellir](https://dwellir.com/), [LuckyFriday](https://luckyfriday.io/), [OnFinality](https://onfinality.io/), [RadiumBlock](https://radiumblock.com/), [RockX](https://www.rockx.com/), and [Stakeworld](https://stakeworld.io/).\n\n\n### **Kusama Bounty**\n\nThis specific bounty is to cover the Kusama related chains. This bounty proposal also covers the costs for the stipends to the curators, and also the external monitoring.  EMA30 $26.164/KSM was used to calculate $132457.14 to 5,062.57 KSM.",

      "title": "Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine Networks (from January to September 2023)",
      "content": "This is a follow up proposal to what we submitted before:\n\n> [#229 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine (from July to December 2022)](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/229)\n\nSubscan is an essential block explorer and analytics tool for the Substrate ecosystem, providing valuable insights to the Substrate community. However, the maintenance and operation of Subscan requires a significant investment of resources, including server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Therefore, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fee for Subscan for the period **January to September 2023** from the Kusama treasury to ensure its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\nWe highly value feedback from our community users, and over the past few months, we've made substantial efforts to reduce infrastructure costs. The results have been both effective and gratifying. Starting from July 2023, the operational expenses have gradually decreased and have recently stabilized. As an illustration, taking our GCP bill as an example, the costs for the past week have decreased by more than 50.52% compared to their historical peak. \nFor specific parameters and billing details, please refer to the \"GCP Bill\" section below.\nFor our specific development efforts, please refer to the \"Operations and Maintenance Cost Reduction Plan\" section below.\n\nThe growth of Subscan is intrinsically tied to the support of our community, which we deeply appreciate. We aspire to enhance community involvement in Subscan's decision-making processes. As a result, we propose a gradual shift in Subscan's development approach, starting from November 2023, towards a community-developer collaborative model. In this new framework, Subscan's development will be guided by the needs and feedback of the community. Features with the highest demand from the community will be prioritized for development, aligning more closely with the ecosystem's requirements. While we have implemented some of these principles in the past, we recognize that they have not been as open and transparent as desired. Our aim is to continually improve upon this aspect. And the specific plan will be officially announced in December!\n\nPlease view the detailed proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MJOhO645uJm5y5Axok_NJCGLxMK8ZiESw_qw7Ff2ldA/edit).",

      "title": "Encointer Lease2 Treasury Proposal 2/2",
      "content": "This is the second of two planned treasury proposals for the current lease of the Encointer common-good parachain. The first share for Q1 and Q2 2023 had been [approved](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/235) by Kusama OpenGov in Dec 2022.\n\nSince the previous proposal, significant changes have occurred around Kusama's Treasury. The implementation of OpenGov resulted in unsustainable spending levels, leading to a restrictive voter backlash aimed at safeguarding the remaining funds in the KSM Treasury. Considering the remaining funds available, Encointer recognizes the need to adapt its funding strategy. Instead of solely proposing to the KSM Treasury, we will now extend our proposals to the DOT Treasury as well, supported by the assertion that Encointer benefits not only Kusama but the entire Dotsama ecosystem. As DOT treasury proposals experience congestion and OpenGov is soon to be implemented on Polkadot, it is imperative to secure uninterrupted funding for our team and prevent any disruptive downramp-upramp scenarios. Therefore, we propose the following measures:\n1. This proposal to the KSM treasury shall cover our expenses for July and Aug 2023\n2. As soon as OpenGov lands on Polkadot, we shall submit a proposal to the \nDOT treasury to cover our expenses from Sept onwards\n\n**The amount of the proposed spend (1.) is CHF 213’000 ≃ USD 234’000**\n\nA growing part of KSM voters is in favor of **retroactive funding** by the treasury. Encointer claims that enforcing retroactive funding for common goods has significant downsides: Asking teams to front the costs themselves in cases where there is no return on investment will keep those teams small and impacts low. Besides Encointer’s established track record, we’d like to emphasize that the founder of Encointer, Alain Brenzikofer, has worked for Encointer without pay from the beginning, which amounts to well above a person-year by now. So, if you insist on retroactive funding, please consider approving this proposal on the grounds of Alain’s pre-investment. \n\n[Detailed proposal Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUVpmTjE81_rwBR38H80rSiwYd3eoPZHE6TGykwlsSo/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

      "title": "Proposal for Mega Web3 DotSama Bootckathons ",
      "content": "**Proponent:** Web3 Group\n\n**Date:**  Main Hackathon and conference in Mexico City: 16th, 17th and 18th June 2023\n\n### Smaller events:\n\n- June  1-2  - 1st Hackathon, UACAM University - Campeche\n- June  5-6  - 2nd Hackathon, UDG University - Guadalajara \n- June  7-8   - 3rd Hackathon, Cetys University - Ensenada\n- June  10-11  - 4th Hackathon, Tec University - Monterrey \n- Road to hackathon 1-30 of May, education bootcamp. \n\n**Request:**  4.701 KSM (140,000 USD) based on EMA7 value 29,78 on the 04/05/2023 tooken from [subscan ](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n\n**Short Description:** Second Hackathon in Mexico focused on education about the Substrate ecosystem, Rust and Gear Protocol with training to developers before the event,  opened to the whole DotSama ecosystem.\n\n### 1.- Introduction\nTHERE IS STRENGTH IN NUMBERS\n\nWeb3Group is a Mexican company dedicated to organizing educational events, mainly focused on hackathons, and has worked with different universities such as IPN, UNAM, and UAM to achieve this. More information about Web3group can be found on its official [website](https://web3-g.com/web3hackathon2023/).\n\nIn 2022, Web3 Group and Gear joined forces to create the first Web3 University Hackathon in Mexico, with a focus on teaching and training future engineers about the stack that Gear shares with Polkadot. The event concluded with a successful hackathon where many dapps were created using the Gear Protocol. This hackathon was combined with a conference to which the general public was invited to listen to well-known speakers in Mexico. The event had 100 students coding and about 300 visitors.\n\nIf you want to see the pictures of the previous event please check this [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-3lE-BApXr8wa5pwD-pYPtE60qWWdZlimn2XVwujARw/edit)\n\nCointelegraph served as our media sponsor and covered the event in their [press release](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/gear-partners-with-the-biggest-mexican-universities-to-bring-first-web3-universities-hackathon), published in both English and Spanish.\n\nAfter our successful first event with the top universities in Mexico, we received positive feedback confirming that there is a lot of talent but a lack of education about the blockchain ecosystem, especially regarding the cutting-edge Polkadot technology.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that our upcoming event will be bigger and better than ever before. We will welcome 300 students and open up the conference events to 600 visitors. Additionally, we would like to invite more parachains to join our exciting hackathon. We are delighted to have the support of the Gear Foundation for this event and would like to extend an invitation to partner with us to spread the word about DotSama and its potential to the next generation of developers and students. Let's work together to create a vibrant ecosystem that will continue to evolve and innovate.\n\n### 2.- Problem statement\n\nAccording to a Chainalysis study. LATAM is the market with the biggest growth in the world on the blockchain ecosystem and the second one with more transactions in 2022. \n\nDespite the significant adoption of blockchain in LATAM, Polkadot/Kusama and its parachains are not yet positioned at the forefront, and there is still room for the development of new decentralized applications within the ecosystem. The adoption of technologies that facilitate an easy transition from web2 to web3 development presents a vast potential for new developers. WASM is a key feature of this adoption, and both Kusama/Polkadot and Gear Protocol share this pillar, utilizing programming languages like Rust to create real potential for growth. However, education is necessary to achieve this goal.\n\nWe really aim to introduce Kusama and Polkadot to the general public in Mexico and students at the country's top universities. These students represent the future developers and adopters of this technology. By exposing them to Rust programming and providing opportunities to develop applications on different parachains, we aim to deeply engage them with the ecosystem. Our goal is to spark interest and generate excitement, and who knows, they may even create the next highly popular app.\n\n### 3.- The proposed solution\n\nWeb3group and Gear Foundation have joined forces to create educational events, including bootcamps, aimed at teaching the tools required to create decentralized applications using Rust compiled to WASM. The culmination of this educational effort will be a Mega Bootcamp, held in conjunction with some of the best computer science universities in Mexico. The event will span the entire country, with more than 30 universities in 5 different locations spreading the word about the Polkadot ecosystem, Substrate, and parachains. The event will culminate in a Mega Hackathon to be held in Mexico City.\n\n**3.1 - How does this proposal help the Dotsama ecosystem?**\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose organizing four regional hackathons aimed at educating students about Kusama and Polkadot. The winners of these hackathons will then be invited to participate in the main hackathon, where they will engage in a three-day coding challenge, receive mentorship, and have the opportunity to build connections within the community. Through this process, participants will gain a deep understanding of the Web3 world and the DotSama ecosystem. This hands-on approach will not only introduce them to the technology but also inspire them to become future developers and adopters of this emerging field.\n\n`Goals`\n\n- Enhance awareness and comprehension of the DotSama Ecosystem and its Parachains.\n- Build a community of skilled developers capable of building cutting-edge technology for the Polkadot ecosystem.\n- Create new minimum viable products (MVPs) for all participating Parachains using decentralized applications.\n\n`Metrics`\n\n- Reach the whole country by doing face-to-face events in 5 main cities. \n- Join the best 30+ universities in Mexico to educate about the technology behind Polkadot/Kusama, parachains and Gear Protocol.\n- Touching 1000+ future engineers to prepare them to use technologies related to the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. \n\nThe proposed initiative aims to benefit the DotSama ecosystem and its parachains, with a focus not only on the community but also on the generation of new future developers. Additionally, a follow-up with continuous educational events is planned to ensure sustained growth and development.\n\nTo accomplish this, we have also partnered with [Zona3](https://twitter.com/lazonatres), an educational institution that will provide Rust programming education to students before they participate in the hackathon. This partnership aims to attract more qualified students to the event and ensure that they are well-equipped to engage with the technology.\n\n### Duration and schedule: \n\nEvent start online : April 28\n\nEvent end face-to-face : June 18\n\nTotal duration: 1 Month 3  weeks\n\nThis event will be executed in different stages:\n\n**Virtual**\n\nDue to Gear's experience in various hackathons, we agreed to hold a bootcamp before the main hackathon, with a focus on providing workshops and educational talks. Each participating parachain will have the opportunity to conduct several workshops and Q&A sessions with the participants to get them excited and prepared to build on their platforms. We have created a schedule of possible time slots that can be occupied by the different parachains for their educational sessions.\n\n- April 28 - Zoom: Talk on-boarding web3 - official start pre boothckathon web3\n- May 2    - Zoom : Workshop Polkadot as the solution to interoperability blockchains. Workshop on Gear and first contract for Vara,- link for the academy, link for rust and link for javascript, html5, react.\n- May 5th - Zoom: First training and follow-up \n- May 12  - Zoom : Second training and follow-up\n- May 19  - Zoom : Third training and follow-up \n- May 26  - Zoom : Fourth training and follow-up \n- May 29 to June 14 - Team building and specialization by Hackathon track in Discord\n\nA more detailed schedule with talking themes will be presented later on, once all the participants have been confirmed.\nAs the educational events have already started, you can see some screenshots on our [web page](https://web3-g.com/web3hackathon2023/) \n\n**Face-to-Face**\n\nWe were also invited to host smaller hackathons in other regions of the country, so we decided to bring them together. There will be four regional hackathons held at major universities, with over 150 students participating in each one, working on solutions. The top three teams from each hackathon will be awarded free trips to the Mexico city Hackathon, with their costs covered as part of the bounty they receive. During these regional hackathons, parachain teams have the option to support participants both online and offline. We are working to ensure the events are held in close proximity to one another, making it easy for people to move between locations and collaborate with the students.\n\n1. UACAM University - Campeche: June  1-2  - 1st Hackathon \n2. UDG University - Guadalajara: June  5-6  - 2nd Hackathon \n3. Cetys University - Ensenada: June  7-8   - 3rd Hackathon \n4. Tec University - Monterrey: June  10-11  - 4th Hackathon  \n\n**Mega face-to-face hackathon**\n\nIn addition to the hackathon, we have decided to use the space at ITAM University in Mexico City to also host a conference. With a lot of knowledgeable people from both the DotSama and Mexican blockchain ecosystems present, we will have the opportunity to bring together top-notch speakers such as Pimpo (organizer of Talentland), Mad Crypto, Lorena Ortiz, Zona3, among others, to give speeches and participate in panel discussions aimed at spreading the word about the blockchain and Polkadot ecosystems to the community. We expect around 300-400 participants to attend this exciting event, with an additional 1000+ viewers tuning in online via the live stream.\n\n### Here is the schedule for the event:\n\n- June 16: Start of the hackathon with additional guidance and a focus on coding.\n- June 17: Full day of coding. Start of the conference with basic talks.\n- June 18: Early morning end of coding with judging to follow. Panel section and discussion, followed by a closing and awards ceremony.\n\n### Location: \n\n1. Campeche  (Side hackathon) - UACAM - https://www.uacam.mx/\n2. Guadalajara  (Side hackathon) - UDG – https://www.udg.mx/\n3. Ensenada  (Side hackathon) - CETYS - https://www.cetys.mx/\n4. Monterrey  (Side hackathon) – TEC  - https://tec.mx/\n5. CDMX  (Main hackathon) - ITAM - https://www.itam.mx/\n\n### Budget and execution:\n\t\nThe bootckathon it's divided into 2 different events:\n\n**Side Hackathons** will be held in four different cities, each with 150 developers participating, for a total of 600 participants. The hackathons will take place over a period of two days and will provide a budget to the universities for the following purposes: \n\n- swag\n- event preparation \n- travel for the winning teams to the main hackathon\n\nThe budget for each location is set at **38,000 USD.**\n\n**Main Hackathon (300 developers)**\n\nThis hackathon will be run within 3 days in 1 main city. The conference will take place 2 days so there will be  space for booths, speakers and community. Ths are the main items of the budget:\n\n- Food And Beverage\n- Swag\n- Security\n- Event Preparation\n\nBudget main location: **92,000 USD**\n\n**Web3group  Event Organization**\n\nWeb3group will take charge of organizing the face-to-face hackathons with each university, coordinating with its suppliers and providing a team of eight individuals to handle various aspects such as design, construction, assembly, disassembly, and event organization.\n\nBudget: **10,000 USD**\n\n**Total Budget: 140,000 USD**\n\nA more detailed and structured budget can be found in this attached [doc.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17KftaGngDF7udrsxxG5S7fH3hxwHuaie/edit#gid=77211956) \n\nThis budget covers the expenses for this proposal, but not the entire cost of the event. The Gear Foundation will also cover pre-event expenses, including visits to universities, coordination of smaller hackathons, and basic expenses such as security and infrastructure costs for universities. Additionally, the Foundation will cover translation services, exclusive giveaways, and the closing party. The total amount contributed by the Gear Foundation will be $40,000 USD. This is excluding the personal that will fly and work to support the education and realization of this hackathons.\n\nWe will allocate the funds in stages, starting with the decoration of the side events and making a prepayment for the main event preparation. We are currently finalizing the details and will provide a more comprehensive timeline in the near future.\n\nWe have already secured the dates and locations for the hackathons with the participating universities. In the unlikely event that this proposal is not approved, we may have to cancel the main conference and limit the hackathon to students only. However, we are actively seeking additional sponsors from the VC community to ensure the success of the events, even if the proposal is not funded.  \nIn the event that this proposal will pass and we still will be mange to secure funds from committed VCs, we will return any unused funds to the treasury. We are committed to transparency and will provide a final report of all expenses, including invoices for larger expenditures if this is needed.\n\nLarge-scale Web3 hackathons were not common before the one we built and ran last year in partnership with the Gear Foundation. While Solana repeated the event this year, it was much smaller in scale, with only one university involved. However, as a Web3 group that started just under two years ago, we have several advantages. Previously, we organized hackathons for Web2 projects and corporations, primarily university-based. One of the UNAMS professors introduced us to Gear representatives while they were discussing the possibility of holding a hackathon there. By leveraging our contacts and expertise, we created the first-ever Web3 university hackathon. The event was a great success, attracting interest from many universities, and inspiring us to organize several regional hackathons and a main closing event. Our goal is to reach more students and universities interested in exploring this technology further, but it is a big lack of educated people, so this events can give a big boost. \n\nThis event is the culmination of two years of hard work, and we are excited to share our experience with the entire Polkadot ecosystem. By bringing together the best and brightest talent, we aim to spread the word about the potential of Substrate and Rust technologies to drive blockchain adoption across the country. We are confident that our event will provide a platform for developers to learn and collaborate, and we look forward to seeing the innovative solutions that emerge from this gathering.\n\nMy name is Jesus, and I represent the Web3 Group. As the main contact person, I will be responsible for managing the relationships with the universities and vendors to ensure the success of this mega event. Me and my team will travel to different regions to guarantee the smooth and efficient operation of the events. Web3 is our passion, and we are committed to delivering the best possible outcome. We will charge a nominal fee for our services, which will primarily cover transportation and salaries. Our aim is to be transparent with all parties involved, and we want to ensure that everyone understands our fees. We are not seeking to profit from this event or make a one-time gain. Instead, we view this as an opportunity to build our reputation and collaborate with others.\n\n",

The bounty has been running for roughly a year now and has helped fund multiple infrastructure proposals, whose details can be found in the spreadsheet here. \n\nThis follow-up top-up will enable us to continue with our efforts as well. \n\nDetails of this proposal, including what we have achieved so far, our future goals, and an estimated breakdown of the requested top-up, can be found in the [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x-KWa7U0oqFuXh_adA5e5BNYqz3ILCdqoDCGE2A5FuY/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "OpenBrush 8-9, 11-12 milestones development (WASM smart contracts)",
      "content": "Dear Kusama Community,\n\nWe would like to share the proposal for the development of 8-9 and 11-12 milestones of [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)\n\n\nYou can check initial discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2522).\n\nThe price was calculated by EMA7 rate on the date of proposal submission, so the calculations were the following:\n235200 / 2 / 34.541 = 3404.64954692 KSM\n\n### TL;DR\nThe purpose of this proposal is to grow the emerging **WASM smart contracts field**, by developing core infrastructure product **OpenBrush**.  \nAs Gavin mentioned in this [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now/) article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. Also, as was mentioned in the approved [WASM smart contracts bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1491) currently smart contracts parachains lead the ecosystem in terms of market adoption. \nHowever, despite WASM tech having a lot to offer, it's not being widely used at the moment simply because of lack of proper tooling and ecosystem infrastructure products\n\n**OpenBrush** is a core infrastructure product, a starting point, and a base for every ink! dApp. 12 production-grade teams and 3 parachains currently use OpenBrush. This proposal is a continuation of the development of the successful product, proposing the most developer-needed features, validated by market feedback.   \n\n### Context\n\nRight now Polkadot ecosystem has a lack of Polkadot native dApps as most of them running are just forks of already existing things on Ethereum network. We already have such unique features as XCMP and WASM smart contracts, but the entrance threshold is too high since there are not much tools to help newcomers use them.\n\nOur team at [Brushfam](https://brushfam.io/) is committed to creating a developer-friendly ecosystem for ink! smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Based on the data we believe that our products, including [OpenBrush](https://github.com/727-Ventures/openbrush-contracts), [Sol2Ink](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink), and [Typechain-Polkadot](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot), have become the starting point for every smart contract developer entering the ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\nWe would like to share our proposal for the development of 8-9 and 11-12 milestones of [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)(10th milestone was implemented in [separate grant ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OySc-dNTBWTF768GOLiPgh4plE1kkO2wI37z-hXvy78/edit)and covered by AlephZero). OpenBrush is a base library for ink! smart contracts. It provides standard contracts (based on PSP), as well as useful contract implementations and macros to help you build ink! smart contracts. \n\n### Roadmap\nWe talked with smart contracts parachains (Astar, AlephZero, Phala) and companies using OpenBrush and have prepared following roadmap for the next milestones of OpenBrush: \n- Creation of educational materials for ink! smart contract developers, designed for both newcomers and advanced developers.\n- Establishment of new standards for smart contracts in Polkadot, with a focus on new NFT standard, and implementation of these standards as part of OpenBrush.\n- Adoption of a chain extension approach in our work.\n- Contribution to the development of ink! smart contract language.\n- Introduction of new features to make OpenBrush more flexible.\n\nWe are committed to achieving these objectives and believe that they will help drive the growth and adoption of ink! smart contracts in Polkadot.\n\n### Full Proposal\nFor more information on our proposal, including a detailed roadmap, please see the following link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b49juyKJN0W-UBHoJ4iS3P_I0Z5a94YoNLxylIf-As8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b49juyKJN0W-UBHoJ4iS3P_I0Z5a94YoNLxylIf-As8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThank you for your consideration, and we look forward to your support!",

      "content": "Submission date: 13.3.2023 ([discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2491) date: 27.2.2023) <br/>\nRequested allocation: 6,533.71 KSM (**210 kUSD**, based on EMA7 by Subscan 1KSM = 32.141 )\n\n<br/>\n\n**Polkagate extension** is a user-friendly extension/wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser. The extension allows users to access their Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps. It injects a @polkadot/api signer into a page, along with any associated accounts.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/BannersArtboard%201.jpg)\n\nPolkagate is now available on [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ginchbkmljhldofnbjabmeophlhdldgp?authuser=3&hl=en), [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkagate/), and [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/polkagate-the-gateway-to/eakellaeidmgcpifaofebhpcjienkajp) web stores for download.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/BannersArtboard%203.jpg)\n\nPolkagate extension’s main supported functionalities, developed in **milestone 1**, are as follows:\n\n- Add address only accounts (To be used as a watch only and proxied address)\n- Contribute to Crowdloans (View contributions/auctions, and contribute to crowdloans)\n- Export/Import/Derive account(s)\n- Ledger support\n- Parachain accounts\n- Phishing website detection\n- Pool staking (Fully supported, including pool management and owners exit facilities)\n- Proxy management (Add/Remove proxy accounts, sign with proxy accounts)\n- QR account import\n- Solo staking (Fully supported, including fast unstake, reward history, and advanced settings)\n- Support different remote nodes\n- Switch to recent chains\n- Transfer funds\n- View balances (Crypto/USD)\n- View transactions history\n- View an address as a QR code\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/BannersArtboard%202.jpg)\n\nPolkagate team aims to provide additional new features, and **the budget is requested for the development of the 2nd milestone**:\n\nAfter the delivery of milestone 1 of the PolkaGate extension with the above mentioned features, We are going to develop the **milestone 2** of the proposal to add the following features to the PolkaGate extension:\n\n**1. Identity management**: Identities exist on-chain but cannot be managed via the extension, we already have shown the identity for accounts, but we want to bring the full management of identities into the extension. Accounts’ names in the extension may differ from their on-chain identities, and this may be inconvenient to distinguish which identity belongs to which name/Id. This problem will be more for users with multiple accounts. Moreover, in social account recovery, when you lose your account, most probably you cannot remember the address, hence on-chain names come in handy! By integrating the identity management into the extension, users not only can easily set their identities but also request judgements using the extension. In addition, using the on-chain identity instead of the local name of accounts, makes the accounts management more convenient. Identities also help social recovery be more user-friendly for users. \n\n**2. OpenGov**: We would like to have OpenGov features in the extension so that most token holders of the community can easily participate in new governance activities. OpenGov is new with more changes in the pipeline (v2.5). Community involvement is still low in openGov activities. Sometimes proposals are very technical, and sometimes users may not be available in the voting period to vote. Making voting more accessible and providing vote/list delegation besides all governance facilities in Polkagate extension, will increase the tokens participated in different OpenGov voting activities. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/Governance%20V0.1%20(1).png)\n\n**3. Light client integration**: We would like to provide the Polkadot light client as an end point in the extension, which will make the extension much more standalone, and help the ecosystem to be more decentralized. If blockchain endpoints stop servicing for whatever reason, since no data can be fetched from them, hence all extensions and wallets would be useless. Integrating the light client inside the extension not only helps to distribute the Polkadot ecosystem more but also lets the extension operate while all existing endpoints stop servicing. However, we need to consider the sync waiting time when using the light client.\n\n**4. Social Recovery**: Managing your own private keys is a difficult task. The average person doesn’t want to spend multiple hours to ensure the security of their keys. This leads to people having difficulties to join the blockchain space or even worse leads to the loss of funds. Social account recovery is the solution. It allows users to recover their accounts if their key or other authentication mechanism has been lost. When an account is recoverable, if you lost the account, you can create a new account named Rescuer, and recover your lost account with the help of your lost account’s on-chain friends in a recovery process.\n\n**5. Misc. updates:** Due to adding new features in milestone 2, some new functionalities need to be added to the currently existing features, and pages need to be upgraded. With vote locking in openGov, the extension’s account page needs to be upgraded to show locks information and let account holders to clear the locks, and also show suitable alerts when locks expire. With vote delegation, we are going to let users have the option to choose un-delegation while unstaking, to have the unlocking period overlapped not stacked. To support XCM, we want to add multi chain transfering to the transfer fund page to let users teleport their tokens.\n\n\nPlease find the **full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOe8dNXycpu4RTmktVBeH9RAV-QW3jeUTHPxMw2rp6M/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThe discussion link on PA: [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2491)",

      "content": "Hi everyone!\n\nAfter having had very constructive discussions with fellow community members both on Polkassembly and privately, and after the go-ahead from the Parity team, we are submitting our proposal on-chain.\n\nWith this proposal, we are seeking funding for setting the stage for **the Italian Polkadot Ecosystem Hub**. \n\nThe tasks included in this proposal are the followings:\n\n1. **Creation of Italian content** -  The purpose of this is to spread the word and knowledge of the ecosystem within the Italian community and reach those people that would be interested in Polkadot, but prefer to approach the subject in their native tongue. This is in line with other recent proposals that have already been passed for other localisation projects.\nMore details about this can be found in the [Content Production](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.2vozd38qrgf4) section.\n\n2. **Implementation of a decentralised blogging platform in Polkadot** - In the spirit of Web3, the reference point of the Italian Hub will be powered by Subsocial Network and open source. We think, this part is valuable to the **entire** ecosystem, not just the Italian-speakers. This means keeping ownership of your own data and content while storing them on the blockchain with no censorship (instead of using tools like WordPress or online platforms like Medium).\nFor more details, see the [Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.hz4vp2rs9brz) section in our proposal. \n\n3. **Community engagement activities and events** - We will increase our presence among the most important Italian ambassadors, communities, and crypto influencers via Social Media and by organizing live shows for the Italian community. We will participate in future events in Italy and abroad.\nFor more details, refer to [Above and Beyond](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.7olosxona40s) and [Marketing and Social Media ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.fjhs79uqy1ej)sections.\n\n4. **Creation of tools for reporting and analytics** - We believe in transparency, so we will provide open reports and charts where anyone will be able to monitor the status of our activities.\nFurther details in [Reporting and Analytics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.hrxkk09upgtj) section.\n\nAll these activities and deliverables have been detailed in our costs and based on current market prices and in line with similar (and already approved) proposals. Please, check our [Budget Breakdown.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit#heading=h.2ueori1eev7w)\n\nOur Mission is simple and defined by the following points:\n\n1. **Substantially increase the availability and quality of content in Italian,** thus creating a foundation of must-have materials where users can learn and interact with the community and the network in their native language.\n\n2. **Establish a trustworthy source of information about the Polkadot Ecosystem** to increment the number of Italian network participants.\n\n3. **Become the point of reference for the Italian community** by sharing both translated and original content on our decentralised blogging platform, while bringing together as much as possible the disjointed Italian communities and ambassadors of the various Polkadot projects.\n\n4. **Empowering the Italian community to be part of the first Italian Polkadot Ecosystem Hub** by allowing anyone to bring their own contributions to the Italian community.\n\n**Full proposal**\n\nYou can find the whole proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RwOWrLDKXmP3_0QkwRfQnG6w0eKDd4ZYWoygHM6hTkk/edit) and the previous Polkassembly discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2465)\n\n**About Polkadot Arena**\n\nPolkadot Arena is an Italian-language project which has been launched by a few members of the Italian language unit of WagMedia who decided to join forces under the name Polkadot Arena. “Arena” has been chosen because it is a place of activity and entertainment where people gather to share their passions and knowledge, to have discussions and have a good time. <br>\nThe team has now been expanded and includes members with a variety of roles within the Polkadot ecosystem and its projects - such as the Italian Head Ambassador, ambassadors, developers, infrastructure providers. At the core, we are technology enthusiasts who want to be part of this exciting ecosystem. <br>\nPolkadot Arena hopes that sharing more content and knowledge will create a wildfire effect in the Italian community, bringing into the ecosystem more and more people that are thrilled about its limitless capabilities.",

      "content": "Proposer: [Georgi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgeivanov/)\n\nThe proposed funding is aimed at supporting the 2023 Polkadot Prodigy Hackathon, which is the first in a planned series of events focused on Eastern European countries. This hackathon will be online format and held closing ceremony in Bulgaria, and is open to developers from around the world.\n\nWith a large number of IT specialists and developers with worldwide potential in web2 and web3, countries such as Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Ukraine and the rest country from Easter Europe are considered to be ideal locations for this type of event.\n\nThe goal of the hackathon is to unite this potential and promote Substrate technology, attract more developers to the Polkadot ecosystem, encourage building and participation across parachains, and create a strong community, particularly in Bulgaria. The event will be held online and will take place over eleven weeks, from 1 May to 15 July 2023. This period includes a pre-hackathon period of 14 days, a six-week hackathon period, and a 20-day judging period.\n\nThe proposed funding will be used to cover the operational costs of the event, as well as the prizes for the winners. By supporting this hackathon, we hope to foster innovation and collaboration within the Polkadot community and beyond.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about our proposal, please review the full details provided in the attached link. We welcome your feedback and comments as we work to make the 2023 Polkadot & Kusama Prodigy Hackathon a success.\n\nFull Proposal Link: [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ND9BO5H06l8LcCcbsSb-xJ7hJho-NE_wZahsrUyK2rU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can check the original discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2451)\n\n",

      "content": "**Short description**: Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable data indexing infrastructure for most of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem (and growing).\n \n**Raw data**: [Archive Infrastructure metrics -October, November, December](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU7QoRiF7Y3HRpR5eQEKBlf17DhLVous_csyEo__G1cGMnEClcn2ckJpaVtkILTrAmdbZHb2Dqp422/pubhtml)\n \n**Requested KSM**: 3,594.64 KSM\n \n**Previous proposal**\nhttps://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/246\n \n# Motivation\nArchives are an important piece of Polkadot and Kusama data infrastructure provided by Subsquid. They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains getting support as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\n \n# Achievements\nOver the course of Q4, Subsquid released incremental upgrades to the SDK, including:\n -  improvements to the TypeScript boilerplate code generator\n - direct support for polkadotJS types bundle format\n - improvements to substrate metadata parsing\n - support for oddYParity for signature parsing in EIP1559 and EIP2930 transactions\n - Deployed new Archives, expanding the list of available networks to 48\nFurthermore, the team has been researching impactful positive changes that have been, or will be released over the course of Q1 2023, as well as ameliorations to the command line tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Statistics\n[Daily queries average](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU7QoRiF7Y3HRpR5eQEKBlf17DhLVous_csyEo__G1cGMnEClcn2ckJpaVtkILTrAmdbZHb2Dqp422/pubchart?oid=565272683&format=interactive)\n\n\nThe data collection pipeline has undergone some changes, and because of this, there are some gaps in the available data (which also influence the weekly moving average in red).\nWith that being said, it is reasonable to assume a linear trend, and the red line represents a linear regression estimation of total queries over time. The gaps in the collected data are visible as \"flattened\" sections of the blue line in the chart: \n\n[Total queries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU7QoRiF7Y3HRpR5eQEKBlf17DhLVous_csyEo__G1cGMnEClcn2ckJpaVtkILTrAmdbZHb2Dqp422/pubchart?oid=1449674255&format=interactive)\n\nUnder this assumption, we can extrapolate these key metrics about Subsquid's Archive infrastructure, over the course of Q4 2023:\n - served a total of 128,567,499 (~128.5 million) queries\n - The highest daily total was 1,832,412 responses in a single 24 hour period\n - The daily queries (both instantly measured, and the weekly window average) confirm a growing trend towards the end of the year, only partly due to the deployment of some new Archives\n\nFull report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQvG5iX9We1LNq6Xpk0UiIGwFnO5BhX63JYYeUtqox9zgzePivJ-7NEOw42tPOHg3Xhti_ohCGLeq5U/pub)\n\n",

We’re on a time crunch and have done all of the marketing organically through Twitter Spaces with teams such as Astar Network, Unique Network, Subsocial and many more.  The conference will take place in the breathtaking location of Naivasha, just 2 hours from the capital city Nairobi. Transport to and from Naivasha will be covered for attendees. With plenty options of accommodation along the same road of the venue.  This idyllic setting offers a unique barefoot networking experience, surrounded by stunning wildlife, and breathtaking scenery at the shores of Lake Naivasha.\n\nKenya has a proven track record of embracing tech innovation, and it is ranked among the top countries globally for crypto and blockchain adoption. In 2021, Kenya was ranked 5th globally for crypto adoption, and 19th in 2022.   As the home of the world’s most ubiquitous mobile payments technology, MPESA, the country's forward-thinking approach to technology makes it an ideal location to host a conference that promotes the benefits of Polkadot and Kusama.  **This conference will equally have a Pan-African appeal, with confirmed attendance from Polkadot Ambassadors in Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Madagascar, and other nations**.\n\nWe aim to bring together individuals and organizations from all over Africa to learn about and explore the opportunities within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.  Polkadot and Kusama aim to provide a scalable and interoperable network that enables seamless communication between different blockchain systems. By hosting the first ever Polkadot conference in Kenya, **we hope to raise awareness of the benefits of this technology and attract new developers, community builders, and users to the ecosystem both locally and in the continent**. \n\nThe conference will bring together developers, researchers, media, investors, and other stakeholders to experience the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, share knowledge, and discover new collaboration opportunities.  **This event truly aligns with Polkadot's roadmap of promoting education and engagement**, and it will provide a platform for showcasing the progress that has been made towards the ultimate goal of creating a decentralized and interoperable network for a new web.\n\nThe unique setting of Naivasha will provide an unforgettable backdrop for networking and exchanging ideas, and attendees will have the opportunity to enjoy the area's natural beauty.  **We have nearly 200 signups for the bootckathon, 87 for speakers, 11 different parachain and ecosystem teams, and 65 local and Africa-wide scholars to be sponsored to attend the hackathon**. During writing this proposal, we have discovered parachain teams from Africa and can’t wait to meet them.\n\nYou can access our **detailed proposal** via the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5j1PTZJ7KTnfEl8nS7lkktDE3-ZG4xq3e2IUxENndA/edit) provided.\n\nFollow us on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/safaridao/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesafaridao?s=21&t=trML2hSMjEjrMlpHYvDYcg) for updates.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. It's linked to this [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2435).\n\nBest regards, \n\nSianoi and the SafariDAO team.",

24th 2023\n**On-chain phase:** February 8th 2023\n\n**Treasury proposal #:** 93\n**OpenGov track:** Big Spender\n\n**Network services:** [Decent Partners](https://decent.partners)\n**Verified funding address:** [Subscan here](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/FvrbaMus8iASyrQYkajQWDxsYvG5gb72PFPuvy8TvkFFVGn)\n**Previous proposals:** [Status](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gu-5YklgTp2f3eDm25Mp6xu2kefP_fp0EW1xSdZD7LY/edit)\n\n**Work to date:** Listen to the pilot series of [GMI Crypto Media](https://gmicrypto.media) and check our channel [FTTF](https://www.youtube.com/@FTTFtv/) here. \n\n**Proposal comment & iteration:** 2 weeks in discussion prior to moving on-chain, EMA7 updated.   \n\n**Short description:** A network public service podcast series charting the rise of crypto-media, featuring familiar faces from within the ecosystem, prospective contributors and independent voices drawn from a wide cross-section of disciplines within a premium original entertainment format.\n\nThe project is a continuation of an [Edgeware funded pilot](https://gmicrypto.media) that featured some of the most well known journalists in the crypto industry and is delivered by an experienced multi-disciplinary team with both a [long track record in the ecosystem](https://decent.partners) and delivering high end series for Apple Music, Spotify, BBC and Channel 4 and founding/scaling successful media properties such as [Copa90](https://copa90.com). \n\nThe project also funds technical development focused on radically simplifying the onboarding experience for new users - using premium media and strategic distribution to drive new and active addresses on Kusama through experimental [wallet-less onboarding](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/wallet-less-onboarding-experimental-concept/458) and non-financial incentives built around a beautiful digital experience and web app with partners [Phantom](https://phantom.land). \n\n**Kusama value proposition:** \n\n- Fundamentally different approach to narrative development to current marketing led approaches. \n- Aims to drive up quality of output, broaden addressable audience whilst rooted in the principles, not just the slogans of Web3. \n- Focuses on advancing novel forms of public goods funding to enable independent media.\n- Seeding content to pre-engaged followers of both our own channel [FTTF](https://www.youtube.com/@FTTFtv) and of guests, removing need for paid media.  \n- Optimising topics and tags for SEO on social platforms to drive long tail of users interested in subjects, rather than guests.\n- Format will feature both current and evergreen themes meaning series will remain valuable in the short, medium and long term. \n- Experimental wallet-less onboarding approach to access series aims to drive active addresses on Kusama. \n- Aims to define active addresses as a more effective measure of the value of treasury media spend than current social media KPIs.\n- Further distribution plans based on partnerships with publishers looking for trusted public media, not marketing messages. \n\n**Contributors:** An expanding collective led by Decent Partners (co-stewards of [Kabocha Network](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-kabocha-an-experimental-kusama-parachain-incubated-by-the-edgeware-community/327), co-founders of [Copa90](https://copa90.com), producers for

Edgeware treasury, presented by well known crypto journalist Joon Ian Wong and produced by Pet Berisha.\n\nThe project aimed to shine a light on the advancing revolution that is ‘crypto-media’ whilst also experimenting with novel forms of public goods funding within the Edgeware ecosystem. \n\nBridging the past, present and potential future of this emerging form, the series was presented as a ‘public service podcast’ and stitched together interviews from some of the leading voices in the space:\n\n- Raoul Pal, Founder, Real Vision\n- David Bailey, CEO BTC Inc\n- Dave Nemetz, Co-Founder, Bleacher Report\n- Cammi Russo, Founder, Defiant\n- Marc Hochstein, Exec Director, Coindesk\n- Allana Roazzi-Laforet, CRO Decrypt\n- Matt Medved, Founder, NFT Now\n- Richard Welsh, Decent Partners\n- Miguel Faus, Film maker, Cadita\n- Dan Roberts, Editor-in-chief, Decrypt \n- Luc Doucet, Founder, The First Mint\n\nWe are now approaching the Kusama treasury to develop the next phase that will expand on the lessons learned in the Edgeware funded pilot project and build on the opportunity to create (network) public service media. \n\n## Problem statement\n\nWe are still very much in the early stages of the crypto revolution and media is at the centre of the battle for the narratives that will shape, define and dictate the direction of the technology.\n\nTo date, crypto-networks have been bootstrapped on the existing incentives of early, mid and late stage social media, with the digital media landscape emerging in lockstep with the vast data monopolies of Google, Amazon and Meta. As a result, existing incentives exert a kind of [narrative gravity](https://decent.partners/direction/crypto-web3-and-narrative-gravity) on the technology and those who develop it.\n\nDespite massive valuations, huge speculative bubbles and a general awareness of crypto-currencies, there are still a vanishingly small number of useful applications and users outside of those used to speculate on its future. \n\nWeb3 promises a path to releasing the stranglehold of the incumbents and yet the crypto-industry at large is still addicted to the incentives that it aims to replace, with resolutely traditional advertising strategies and brand partnerships turbo-charging speculation that has become a poor proxy for relative adoption and worth.\n\nAs a result current podcasts generally focus on the more financial aspects of the industry, since they rely on sponsorships and advertising revenue, or have an explicit marketing mandate, which ensures only positive stories are surfaced, leading to the formation of echo chambers that are rooted in repeating technical messages or announcements rather than creating original entertainment with cultural impact. \n\nThe Kusama ecosystem had just over [10,000 active addresses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h45CqUWZ2seUhbxMW6LBX4HbSxk6GouOYLyTiRQEiik/edit#gid=0) in the last 30 days. This does not mean 10,000 unique users, since power users, validators and teams will operate multiple addresses, meaning the number of contributors is likely lower. \n\nTo date, the primary marketing mechanism for driving new addresses on Kusama has been crowdloans which used direct financial incentives to onboard both venture capital and retail investors to slot auctions for new parachains. \n\nThe first Kusama slot was secured by [Karura](https://medium.com/acalanetwork/karura-wins-first-ever-parachain-slot-auction-in-kusama-polkadot-ecosystem-brings-defi-platform-62c04aaf09a1) with over 500k KSM committed. The last few crowdloaned slots have been secured with around 2k KSM representing a fall of 99% from the peak. Larger teamsare now self-funding slots, reducing the marketing function of auctions even further. \n\nOutside of crowdloans, the majority of treasury funded marketing and media spend has relied on creating and distributing content across social networks, utilising legacy metrics to assess relative progress - impressions, likes, comments, subscribers and views.\nThis approach is led by a more general notion of awareness that is hard to measure and thus difficult to price, leading to challenges with scaling the model beyond the more localised impact of core ecosystem education to already engaged holders and contributors. \n\nWith large public treasuries and its ability to develop more fluid decision making and organisational tools, Polkadot and its ecosystem offers a platform for the emergence of new talent, platforms and indeed narratives - challenging the current orthodoxy of crypto-media. \n\nPolkadot and the W3F have explicitly avoided the usual click-bait and influencer partnerships during the development of the ecosystem, however now the technology is production ready, there is a need for innovation around the way the story of the ecosystem is told, and indeed a requirement to return to the values and principles that root Web3 rather than just repeating marketing messages. \n\nThe next wave of adoption will be driven by impactful projects delivering real world value, addressing real needs and generating actual utility. The questions we seek to ask in this series:  \n\n- How will this happen? \n- Where will these projects come from? \n- What will they look like? \n- What questions will they be asking?\n- What challenges will they be addressing?\n- What value will they bring?\n- How can people contribute?\n\nUltimately, how do we reach, engage and inspire people to begin a journey of contribution rather than speculation and in turn bootstrap adoption of the underlying technology? \n\n## Introducing GMI crypto media season 1\n\nGMI crypto media is initially a podcast series, but we aim to develop it further into a core part of a crypto-native media network, all built on and around Substrate’s emerging set of tools, technologies and talent through objectively independent funding and editorial structures - moving towards a clear separation between church and state, removing direct financial incentives that conflate and confuse current initiatives that aim to present independent media.\n\nThe series will feature established and emerging faces from the community and focus on digging deep into the underlying philosophies that drew them in, providing insights and education that will be most useful to those motivated to contribute, rather than speculate. \n\nIt will also feature people from outside of the ecosystem - whose experience provides context for the challenges the technology aims to address. \n\nImportantly it will also feature those skeptical about the industry, pessimistic about its potential and even those who see issues with the current technical, economic or organisational tools, projects and mechanisms of the ecosystem. \nPart of Polkadot’s unique capability is its power to change and so we want to reflect this emergent characteristic - our hope is that these interviews can not only inspire those outside the ecosystem, but also give pause for those in it to rethink assumptions and have their ideas challenged.  \n\nIn this regard, this is explicitly not a marketing initiative - we will not be utilising paid media for distribution, nor paying for PR or influencers - it is a public service initiative, not just for the ecosystem, or potential contributors but for a broader community of academics, institutions and media outlets looking for credible, accurate and independently produced media. \n\n## Format development \n\nGMI Crypto Media will advance from the initial experiment which took the form of an audio-documentary, rather than just recorded interviews. \n\nThis is a far more creatively challenging and time consuming process that also allows for more originality when it comes to delivering a differentiated series.\n\nAlongside recorded conversations, we will include debate, archive material, musical interludes and even comedy sketches that all serve to bring to life the magic and mayhem of this rapidly emerging space - creating a must-listen series that redefines the way people interact not just with the ecosystem, but crypto in general.\n\nOur ambition is to not make an original crypto podcast, it is to make an original podcast that will appeal to a wide and varied cross-section of society.   \n\nOne reference for the direction we aim to take the podcast is the Apple commissioned series [Midnight Miracle](https://luminarypodcasts.com/listen/talib-kweli-yasiin-bey-and-dave-chappelle/the-midnight-miracle/c88501e3-f783-43cc-b00a-022d2a3ad33b?country=US) that features Dave Chapelle, Yasiin Bey and Talib Kweli. \n\nYou can get a feel for the type of material we’ve made historically by visiting our [FTTF](https://www.youtube.com/@FTTFtv) YouTube channel.\n\n## Teasers\n\nPer [Bruno's comment](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2158#945f8a0b-6dc0-40c8-b896-627476bfe6bd):  We are working on the format of the series - we will likely record video for some sequences and interviews but do not want to overpromise in this regard.\n\nWe will be creating short cutdowns, clips and teasers to push to the main episodes that will connect to our existing audience of 13.9K subscribers and for the talent that appear to share across their social platforms, all driving to the wallet-less onboarding where they can listen to the series for free. \n\n## Distribution and partnerships  \n\nWe expect those who feature to share the media themselves - but this will be done by them under no direction from us. \nThis approach of credibly neutral and transparently funded media can in turn allow us to deliver distribution partnerships for more objective and trusted media - especially those who are publicly accountable.\n\nThese publishers lack the kind of deep thinking, insights and access that the current ad-supported or marketing driven crypto-media landscape produces and so are desperate for content that they can trust. \n\nThis is the value of an approach that sets independence, balance and credibility above all else. \n\n## Development, schedule and communication\n\nAs with any creative endeavour within highly experimental domains things can and do change.\n\nThings that appear simple end up being complex, whilst things that should be complex come off without a hitch. More often, there are simply many surprises, dead ends and issues that cannot be accounted for within an initial pitch. \n\nAs a result the creators reserve the right to develop the format to best serve the explicit purpose of the proposal to develop a public service podcast series that aims to present balanced, critical and informative output that becomes valued by established and emerging publishers and distributors looking for high quality information sources. \n\nWe will provide updates to voters in a consistent and timely manner and alert holders if there are any critical issues. \n\n## Driving adoption of the technology \n\nIn its initial incarnation, we aim for the podcast to be accessed for free through a [wallet-less onboarding process ](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/wallet-less-onboarding-experimental-concept/458) linked to Kusama addresses, that we are collaborating with Michel and Travis from Parity on. \n\nThat onboarding is matched with [Kabocha’s](kabocha.network/) non-transferable NFT identity ‘[Seeds](https://gov.edgewa.re/discussion/6355-kabocha-seeds-outlining-the-evolving-concept-for-sovereign-identity-in-the-edgverse-and-beyond)’ providing an on-ramp into the ecosystem for those who discover the content directly or through partners. \n\nGiven the public good nature of the project and varying interview subjects, we will approach the further technological development of the project with an emergent mindset - allowing the builders we speak to and the community who listen to us to shape the emerging technical advances of the project.\n\nIn the future we aim to utilise our in development decision-making, talent sourcing and collective creation platform [Root](https://github.com/stated-tech/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/root.md). \n\nIn this way we see this more as a creative project, than a fixed podcast, one that can slowly iterate and evolve into a native on-chain network and collectives that also drives adoption of on-chain identities, assigns credit using verifiable on-chain credentials, streaming on Substrate native technologies and opening the door to all manner of experimental creative executions. \n\n## Collaborative creation \n\nWe will have a select set of people we would aim to interview from a wide range of backgrounds, but we are also open to this being a collaborative project where there is a path for the community to suggest people and indeed topics - something that we aim to expand over time as the project develops. \n\nIn time we aim for this to become a core part of the project’s development and something that will experiment with form made uniquely possible through the underlying technology. \n\n## Deliverables \n\n- Season 1: 10 episodes of 30-60 minutes \n\n- Memes, social clips, teasers, trailers and longer form interviews to be distributed across social media that drive audiences to listen to the main series.\n\n- Web app / digital site and experience that is linked to signup process.\n\n- Access to the podcast will initially be accessed through wallet-less onboarding\n\n- A subscription requiring the creation of an address and an identity. \n\n- Distribution and seeding plan and activation\n\n## Production \n\nWe will be basing production at our London community studio [Portico](https://theportico.uk) but we will also be recording interviews with guests from around the world as well as recording sequences out and about in the real world. \n\n## What does success look like? \n\nAt this early stage, we are not setting any *quantitative* metrics or KPIs but the core of the project is rooted around an experiment that will seek to demonstrate that original media can drive new and active addresses on Kusama and beyond. \n\nWe believe this will prove to be a more effective measure of the value of treasury media spend than purely legacy social media KPIs.\n\nFrom a qualitative perspective, if the project succeeds in its ambition of being a trusted source of information, valued by those inside and outside the ecosystem and indeed helps us to experiment with novel forms of onboarding into an emerging Subtrate native crypto-media network we believe that should be seen as a success.\n\nOnly in further stages of production will we begin to understand the impact this and other projects that have been incubated through fully on-chain development are having, and indeed metrics we should care about. \n\n## Potential development lifecycle   \n\n1. Edgeware pilot funding [complete]\n2. Kusama season 1 \n3. Development of a creative collective with sustained funding from Polkadot\n\n## Timeline\n\nWe will begin pre-production after funding is approved. \n\nDelivery of episodes will be dependent on availability of guests, but conservatively we’d hope to conclude the series within 6-9 months. Episodes will likely be available sooner. \n\n ## Report\n\nOn conclusion of the project, we will produce a report that charts our learnings from both a quantitative and qualitative perspective and if successful set the stage for the continuation and evolution of the project.  \n\n ## Conflicts of interest\nNone \n",

We expect this technology to bring a whole new wave of users to the Kusama ecosystem that have no previous background or knowledge about blockchain or cryptocurrencies.\n\n### Links\n\n* [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sh5w-d-0tiQjBg1nPj-9cl5LFFZ3s_M-9bl0Dko7y2Q/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1og1OMHyP4oarnK6inE9TrdYaOKltstT-DC6WExnsYq8/edit?usp=sharing)\n* VirtoLIVE: [#2](https://youtu.be/wk-NWqBktV4) [#1](https://youtu.be/mX3_RcKsJvQ)\n\n## Progress updates\n\nThe team aims to follow a 2 week sprint cycle where every sprint is closed with a VirtoLIVE(might not be live) that serves as a demo day.\n\n- **Sprint #1 - feb 20-mar 6**: \n  - Libwallet.js and Sube.js **[highlight]**: We created JS bindings of our client libraries while still making breaking changes to the API \n  - Super app: On boarding to [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com), our chosen front-end framework\n  - Valor: Planning the re-write of our PoC runtime to be embedded friendly and built around [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) with its upcoming component model.\n- **Sprint #2 - mar 6-20**:\n  - [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/8d1e99ced7064ca695e4ba7b3541d8d4) working of Sube.js and Wallet.js sending transactions in the browser\n  - App: integrating matrix rust sdk and troubleshooting issues with room synchronization.\n  - Valor: Using Embassy the async runtime for embedded(desktop and WASM too) integrated with a WebAssebly abstraction to run WASI plugins in different platforms.   \n- **Sprint #3 - mar 20-apr 3**:\n  - After researching how we could build on top of the [Conduit homeserver](https://conduit.rs) as initially proposed we concluded that we can't really use it as the base of our WASM centric homeserver, \n  therefore we will be starting a new homeserver implementation called **[emma](https://github.com/virto-network/emma) from scratch**. Matrix homeservers are extensive multi-year developments\n  but we plan to get to a PoC stage by the end of this proposal. \n  - The team if gaining speed with Rust, our junior, mid and senior developers didn't have Rust experience before but are getting more comfortable with the language over time after several sessions of pair programming and assisted problem resolution.  \n- **Sprint #4 - apr 3 - 17**:  \n  - Initial set up of [ksm.community](ksm.community) where we will host a dedicated Matrix homeserver and an instance of our \"super app\" to be used as test ground were we can showcase the Virto stack to the Kusama community.\n  - [WIP](https://github.com/virto-network/sube/issues/28#issuecomment-1496307094) aligning Sube's Rust API with its JS version exposing a simple single `sube!` macro that can be used for both querying and submitting transactions to the blockchain.\n  - [Merged](https://github.com/virto-network/libwallet/pull/30) still experimental API of the JavaScript version of libwallet + fix WASM compilation issues. \n  - Valor: solving execution of multiple concurrent WASM plugins in a single threaded environment\n- **Sprint #5 - apr 17 -may 1**: ([goals of the sprint](https://matrix.to/#/!hjjaLvBFZianunvUCO:virto.community/$CTcvIwqCAABQ-7TodF93GrF1Tacddc_sCIeV-X1j7_U?via=virto.community&via=matrix.org))\n  - PoC server exposing `.well-known` Matrix endpoint compiled to `wasm-wasi`, used to test a possible interface between the Valor runtime and WASM plugins and to kick-start the development of our future homeserver [emma](https://github.com/virto-network/emma)(embedded matrix)\n  - Our experimental [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) based Matrix client can join rooms, send, receive messages and get notifications.\n  - More Rust learning and sharing taking place within the team. \n- **Sprint #6 - may 1 - 15**: ([goals of the sprint](https://matrix.to/#/!hjjaLvBFZianunvUCO:virto.community/$WH5CrrafiXg2PbiIX14JCFEQlM4I8KDvTUxxDnT3yFo?via=virto.community&via=matrix.org))\n  - Draft plugin interface, in other words, define the simplest way developers can create applications(Valor plugins) in the Virto ecosystem.\n  -  Work in progress about integrating a \"timeline\" abstraction in the Matrix client to efficiently fetch text messages, also improve styles while final design is defined.\n- **Sprint #7 - may 15 - 29**: in progress([goals of the sprint](https://matrix.to/#/!hjjaLvBFZianunvUCO:virto.community/$JzmNvqOYRk-80znPbMBh-TS-kP-NCz_bcewg-uCt5QM?via=virto.community&via=matrix.org)) ...

Thanks for the feedback on [referendum 47](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/47), we learnt a lot and are now resubmitting our proposal to fund us The [Virto](https://virto.network) team. We are a group of creative and competent individuals with an extraordinary track record of building multiple projects in the ecosystem with funds from the treasuries and Web3 foundation. We aim to become the _\"Latin American Parity\"_ team of builders, focusing on creating user-friendly technology and tools to bring Polkadot technology to the masses.\n\nWe are proposing to build a **developer-friendly stack** to build impactful Web3 infrastructure for Kusama to empower individuals and communities through _user-friendly Web3 tools_ and **increase** decentralized technology adoption in the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. The team is requesting `20,000 KSM` in funding to continue our work towards reducing social inequality and improving the efficient allocation of public resources. Our team's vision is to reduce social inequality and improve the efficient allocation of public resources by empowering local communities with autonomous micro-economies through our Local Incentives Protocol (LIP).\n\nGiven our previous work helping 350k+ families in Venezuela to keep their money value using crypto, we have a deep understanding of the ecosystem and, most importantly, first-hand experience building and deploying real use case solutions using web3 technology. By making it accessible to regular users, we can solve real-world problems with social impact and reduce inequality by providing a more efficient allocation of public resources.\n\nYou can check a short slideshow where we expose the problem and our proposed solution [**here**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-W13YnDHDfen7KIC0vALXbvHupEomqhg9nYUaJyxy9g/edit#slide=id.gf87435e6da_0_183), and our full proposal document [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b48eTa9GU7s0_Xf4hkyc7M1netZvNbGONJ8D_IgoknA/edit#).\n\n**Edit - Extra content:**\n- [First VirtoLIVE stream](https://youtu.be/mX3_RcKsJvQ) with team's intro and projects explainer\n- [VirtoLIVE Q&A #1](https://youtu.be/wk-NWqBktV4) (17/01/23): Addressing Pokassembly questions.",

🎆 I'm Daniel, long time builder in the ecosystem, Senior ambassador,\n*humble fellow* of the Polkadot fellowship and team lead of the Virto team of the\n[Virto Network][LI]. \n\nThis proposal is about **supporting us** the Virto team(more than a roadmap or specific project), we are a\ncreative and very capable group of individuals with great track record building multiple projects in the ecosystem\nwith funds from the treasuries and Web3 foundation(piggy bank too): \n- [`Sube` + `Scales`][SB]: 20,000 EUR https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/616\n- [`orml-payments`][PY]: 36,000 kUSD https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/lip_payments.md\n- [`libwallet`][WL]: 28,800 USD https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/825\n- [Fido][FD] PoC: 69,750 USD https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/246\n\nIt hasn't been the easiest building this way but we believe developing with the ecosystem \nfunds for the ecosystem is the right way to go specially when creating out of the box solutions in the best Kusama style. \n\nWe have several exiting projects lined up for 2023 ready for development with the \nmain theme theme of making blockchain technology extremely accessible to the\nnon-crypto-native 99% of the population.\n\n#### 2023 Projects overview\n- **Summa**: *Substrate Meets Matrix*, a lightweight multi-chain capable node extensible with \nWebAssemply plugins, integrated with Matrix(decentralized communications protocol that powers Element)\nto interact with Substrate blockchains via the messaging protocol.  \n\t- **Summa pallet**: A blockchain module to create a tighter integration with Substrate, \n\ttake on-chain actions based on Matrix events, control Matrix rooms/communities on-chain or \n\tseamlessly use Matrix accounts and multiple devices with your blockchain. \n- **Hardware prototyping**: A limited edition handcrafted wood-leather key ring prototype of \na *hardware wallet you can lose* without fear of losing your funds.\n- **Valor**: *Virto's async lightweight open runtime*, the plugin system and developer platform \nthat powers Summa, our super app and hardware wallets. \n- **FiDOS Super app**: Web application(no special installation needed) extensible with WASM applets,\nit integrates with merchant's web sites for example and it would include apps to manage your summa node and hardware wallets.\n- Further development and improvements to Sube, Scales, Libwallet and other related projects.\n- **[Kreivo][KV] Parathread**: The tokenless sister chain of Virto Network for payments of real-world\n products and services that empowers local communities with its tax collection system.\n  - [SwapCash][SC]: An initial use-case of a real world marketplace for decentralized on&off-ramps.\n  - [The Federation][TF]: A Fellowship-like ranked collective, an extract of the *Local Incentives Protocol* \n  that attempts to bring the ambassador program on-chain and turn its members into local leaders that can better represent the interests of KSM/DOT holders.  \n- **Dot.Builders(new - extra credits assignment)**: PoC of a ranked collective that would allow teams that\nare committed to bring long term value to Kusama and Polkadot to have easier \nrecurrent access to treasury funds in an automated way based on their reputation\nlevel and previous accomplishments to avoid going through the somewhat inefficient\nand clumsy process of individual proposals, referenda and the micromanagement culture \nthat results from this kind of process :)\n\nThe highlights and priorities for 2023 are Summa and the Hardware wallet as they can have a \nbigger impact short term. Before rushing out a blockchain with no utility into \nexistence we want to focus on experimenting with different forms of user interaction that result\nfamiliar and intuitive to the broad audience. \nWe have been laying down the foundations of a technology stack we believe can tackle\nthe many issues the industry is facing to attract mass adoption without \ncompromising decentralization, trying to make the technology extremely accessible,\nsimple to use, cheap and overall remove as many entry barriers as possible, such as:\n\n- Abstract blockchain protocols. The average Moe doesn't care about them.\n- Hide away cryptography. i.e. say goodbye to seed phrases.  \n- Be familiar. Metaverses, NFTs, Staking, etc. are cool new concepts but\nintimidating for the 99% of non-crypto savvy population which is our focus(let's first grow the pie!). \n- Speak our users language. Avoid new jargon and words that need explanation.\n- Universal and cheap, don't assume everyone has capable smartphone, knows how \nto install a browser extension or has good(or any?) internet connectivity.\n- Fear of the unknown. Regardless of the intrinsic security of blockchain,\ntrusting your life's savings to new technology is scary.\n\n\n---\n\n## The Virto Stack<sub>*(projects detail)*</sub>\n\nTo serve the use cases we aim for we've gone a long way creating a technology stack from scratch that\nputs a lot of focus on user/developer experience and very lightweight, simple, power/memory efficient, WASM friendly libraries\nthat can *run everywhere*, this aids in our long term vision to really bringing blockchain technology to the masses, specially empowering regular users in areas where digitization and technology penetration is low and people might have never heard the word blockchain, there is an opportunity to provide inexpensive hardware and efficient software to connect people to Web3 services.\n\n> ℹ️ Road-map is subject to change, estimates of times and human resources(engineering, design, user research, etc.) \nare approximate and team members(12+ people) will be dynamically allocated to the right project on a need basis.\n\n## Valor\n[github.com/virto-network/valor](https://github.com/virto-network/valor)\n\n![Valor roadmap][T1]\n\n*Virto's async lightweight open runtime*, is a WebAssembly runtime abstraction that based on a target platform selects an appropriate WASM compiler(e.g. Wasm3 in embedded devices, Wasmtime for servers, etc). Using the upcoming \"Web Assembly component model\" we define or make use of existing host interfaces to expose different capabilities to the plugins that are loaded on an internal registry and are supervised in case plugins were to fail.\n\nAn important aspect of Valor is to be developer friendly, have enough tooling and define easy to use interfaces so developers can create new plugins in no time without complications.\n\n![Valor architecture][VA]\n\n## Summa\n\n[github.com/virto-network/summa-node](https://github.com/virto-network/summa-node)\n\n![Summa roadmap][T2]\n\n*Substrate meets Matrix* is the implementation of a Matrix homeserver and Smoldot based node developed in Rust that can compile to WebAssembly to run in the browser. The Matrix and blockchain functionality are developed as WASM components running on top of Valor, WASM runtime and message broker that routes incoming messages to the blockchain component and other user provided plugins.\n\nThe node is distributed as a lightweight single binary easy to deploy with support for multiple blockchains(thanks to Sube). It is great as a personal cloud and easy entry point for users to the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystems as users only need simple WebAuthN or phone number authentication, it provides encrypted communications out of the box including access to any public Matrix channels(all official communication channels in the ecosystem that are hosted by Parity and the Web3 foundation use this protocol).  \nBuilding on top of the Matrix account and device management system means users only ever need a friendly MXID(e.g. `@olanod:virto.community`) to send funds to a friend, multiple devices are supported and even multiparty signature support in case you want to require transactions to be confirmed with a different device or a hardware wallet. \nWith Matrix built-in [*Secure Secret Storage and Sharing*][SS] protocol there is also an out-of-the-box solution for secure account backups and arbitrary user secrets.\nFinally more functionalities are available when installing different plugins that can turn your node into a decentralized notification system or a personal bot assistant that can sign transactions on your behalf. \n\n![Summa arch][SU]\n\n## Hardware wallet prototype\n\n![Wallet prototype roadmap][T3]\n\nHardware development is hard and designing crypto wallets to keep in a cold storage with your life's savings makes things even harder as there are a lot of security considerations in their fabrication that increase their price, but it doesn't have to be that way. At Virto we think there is need for a new category of wallets, small cheap devices that are meant to be carried around without the fear that losing them means losing our funds.\n\nAs part of our previous work on the Fido prototype we added support for new kinds of back-ends to libwallet and created a simple device that can be used to confirm and sign transactions with the push of a button. Continuing with this idea, we want bring the Virto Stack to inexpensive and commonly available hardware modules, keeping the \"artistic\" style(wood+leather for the next experiment) and assemble a limited amount of devices to be given away later this year.\n\nThe next iteration of the software would be more complex as we will make several optimizations across the stack to fit Valor and other plugins that effectively turn the device into a Matrix client so it can respond to messages in a chat room(e.g. \"please sign this transaction\"), we would add support for multi-party signatures, a kind of multi-sig that doesn't require sending transactions to the blockchain, so your device can serve as second confirmation factor or the only factor when transacting with small amounts.\n\nLastly we want to include, at least in a few prototypes, a LoRaWAN capable chip that allows transmitting small amounts of data over long distances that we would use to test the design of an accurate-enough *proof of location protocol* useful for location sensitive protocols like LIP(or Encointer). This technology is good in places with bad connectivity where users could broadcast a signed transaction to a nearby station(e.g. kiosk,point of sale,neighbor) that submits the transaction on their behalf.\n\n![Fido Primero][F1]\n(We promise next prototypes will be prettier than *Fido Primero*)\n\n## Kreivo\n\n[github.com/virto-network/virto-node](https://github.com/virto-network/virto-node)\n\n![Kreivo roadmap][T4]\n\nKreivo means creativity, the best virto(virtue) of Kusama 😉 It's the first implementation of the *Local Incentives Protocol*, our initial effort to bring the the ecosystem closer to a more general non technical audience by providing a place where people can easily form/join communities to conduct real world economic activities that create utility for the ecosystem tokens, such as setting up marketplaces where local merchants or service providers can make a fair living transacting in KSM, or with stable coins.\n\nLIP focuses on making decentralized local businesses be socially responsible without compromising their profitability, a dynamic tax system enables the collection of resources that empower local communities to become their own autonomous micro-economies as well as the fair usage of collected resources for other common good causes like addressing climate change or inequality among others.\n\nFrom the start LIP was designed for a token-less, yet sustainable blockchain. We prefer this design as governance is not in the hands of a few VCs or team members and it can bring more value to Kusama and to the commercial communities that struggle to attract value to their tokens. The real value of the network will come from the real world use cases that find their home in Kreivo(and later Virto) that will have the incentive to develop and sustain the common shared infrastructure.\n\n### A parachain powered by `orml-payments`\n\nIn practice Kreivo would work in a similar way as Statemine which is built\naround the `pallet-assets` and `pallet-uniques`. Our parachain instead has \n`orml-payments` as its core functionality, we built the pallet with the support \nof a Web3 grant and later brought to a wider audience by successfully merging to\nthe well known ORML community repository. This Substrate module is what makes \npossible to securely pay for products and services thanks to its built-in \nescrow-like system with refunds, disputes among other features that also include\nthe dynamic fee collection system that communities will use to generate local \nand global impact.\n\n### Governance\n\nKreivo/Virto's governance would be delegated to the Collectives parachain in the future \nwhere we wish to launch the *Trade Association* and [*The Federation*][TF], a ranked collective \nformed by local/regional leaders that serve as delegates of the many DOT holders spread around the globe.\nTogether with the relay-chain's governance the three bodies can dictate the fate of different\naspects of the chain.\n\n### Some use cases\n\n#### Decentralized on/off-ramps\n\nCurrent experience for attracting new users is very poor in the ecosystem as most people\nhave to resort to centralized exchanges that are not easily available in every \npart of the world and require cumbersome verification processes.\nVirto team's first show case for the technology is *swap.cash*, a fiat-to-crypto\nmarketplace that benefits from the payments pallet and built-in decentralized \ncommunications to offer a seamless Uniswap-like experience and embeddable \n*Swap API* for developers that want to on-board new users to the ecosystem by\nfor example allowing fiat payments to merchants that are payed in a stable\ncoin.\n\n#### d-commerce\n\nThe most compelling use case for Kreivo and Virto in the long term is likely\ndecentralized commerce, which is not just traditional e-commerce plus crypto\npayments, we see d-commerce as a way to put together under the same roof a\nuniverse of composable real-world economies where people trade in a more\ntransparent and fair way that puts users and communities in control, where\nthere are clearly defined rules(in the form of code) on how wealth is responsibly\ndistributed for the overall community's sake, for common good causes and\nultimately for the users themselves that are owners of the very same products\nthe use.\n\n## FiDOS Super APP\n\n[github.com/virto-network/fido](https://github.com/virto-network/fido)\n\n![FiDOS roadmap][T5]\n\nA decentralized chat-centric super-app for the Web(not an extension), desktop and mobile. It's the go-to graphical interface for \"Virto products\", same as the hardware wallets it is a Matrix client in disguise with the ability to extend its features with WebAssembly plugins. One can install new applets or *teach new tricks*(mini overlay applets) from repositories maintained by the community.\nOver time we will add more official applets and UI components to make it very simple for other users to develop new functionality.  \n\n![FiDOS App][SA]\n\n## Scales\n\n[github.com/virto-network/scales](https://github.com/virto-network/scales)\n\n![Scales roadmap][T6]\n\nMaking use of type information this library allows conversion to/from SCALE encoded data without allocating an intermediate representation, specially useful when conversion is for dynamic types like JSON.\n\n## Sube\n\n[github.com/virto-network/sube](https://github.com/virto-network/sube)\n\n![Sube roadmap][T7]\n\nA client library and CLI for Substrate chains with reduced API(one `sube` function) and a big focus on size and portability so it can run in constrained environments like the browser.\n\nMaking use of the type information in a chain's metadata(powered by Scales), Sube allows automatic conversion between the SCALE binary format used by the blockchain with a human-readable representation like JSON without having to hardcode types for each network. When submitting extrinsics Sube delegates the responsibility of signing the payload of a transaction to an external tool(e.g. libwallet).  \nSube supports multiple backends under different feature flags like http, http-web or ws/wss, with the planned support for smoldot.\n\nWhen paired with Valor, Sube can be exposed as an HTTP API that runs both in the server and the browser and be composed with other plugins to create higher level APIs that a client application can use from any platform thanks to the ubiquitousness of HTTP. We imagine existing centralized projects easily integrating with Substrate blockchains in the server with the option to progressively migrate to a decentralized set-up with the whole back-end later running in the user device(e.g. web browser). More interestingly it can be used for *progressive decentralization* to give users the the best user experience, a Sube powered application can start being served from a server to have an immediate response and 0 start-up time and since plugins can be hot-swapped, the blockchain back-end can be switched from HTTP to light node transparently without the application code ever realizing, giving our users with bad connectivity and slower devices the opportunity to enjoy the best possible user experience without compromising decentralization.\n\n## Libwallet\n\n[github.com/virto-network/libwallet](https://github.com/virto-network/libwallet)\n\n![Libwallet roadmap][T8]\n\nA lightweight and very portable library with simple to understand and use abstractions that allow creating chain-agnostic crypto wallets able to run in all kinds of environments like native applications, hosted wallets, the browser or even embedded hardware.  \nWe have been adding support for multiple backends and will continue to do so specially for different hardware modules with varying interfaces and architectures. \n\nAfter adding EVM and Bitcoin accounts support and thanks to the ability of a libwallet client to queue transactions before signing, we imagine\ninteresting cross chain use cases like sending BTC to a bridge and sign a Substrate transaction at the same to avoid the problem of using multiple wallets and multiple confirmations. \n\n# Team and costs\n\nThe Virto team has been working on an ad-hoc basis in a not very sustainable way, with concurrent members ranging \nanywhere from 2 to 8 depending on availability of resources. However the pool of team members ready to jump full time in the\nproject to deliver milestones on time is around 12+ people assuming economic stability is guaranteed.\n\nWe can count on:\n\n[DO]: https://github.com/olanod\n[DB]: https://github.com/S0c5\n[PA]: https://github.com/pandres95\n[JV]: https://github.com/JorgeVV\n[NB]: https://github.com/nbari\n[JD]: https://github.com/johandroid\n[ST]: https://github.com/stanly-johnson\n[MA]: https://github.com/manuelcastrobarinas\n[BV]: https://github.com/b-avb\n[RO]: https://de.linkedin.com/in/robjalkh\n\n- 1 team lead ([Daniel][DO])\n- 4 Senior software engineers ([David][DB], [Pablo][PA], [Jorge][JV], Stanly*)\n- 1 Expert Devops engineer ([Nicolas][NB])\n- 1 Embedded engineer ([Johan][JD])\n- 2 Mid-level engineers ([Bryan][BV], Gabi*)\n- 1 Junior engineer ([Manuel][MA])\n- 1 All in one senior designer ([Roberto][RO])\n- 1 User researcher (Edith)\n- 1 Economist (Q.C.)\n- 1 Content creator (Camila)\n\n> \\* needs confirmation.   \n> ℹ️ More *virtuous* members can join our next phase of development with enough work for everyone but for now this is a size we are comfortable with given the limited amount of funds requested.\n\nThe average monthly cost per person is around 3,000+ USD, a 9 months budget for the team ranges from **324,000 to 378,000 USD**.  \nWith the requested 20,000 KSM at a price of 23.5USD/KSM(EMA7) that would equal 470,000 USD, minus 10K of operational costs(infrastructure, hardware wallet materials and equipment) and leaving a 20% buffer to account for price fluctuations, missed deadlines and other (un)expected circumstances we are left with **368,000 USD**.  Worst case scenario if things don't go as bad as usual, there will be extra funds to bring some more awesomeness to Kusama.\n\n**EDIT:** more info on the team budget and how it compares to market salaries in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TEYrYIDi_4J3xfHK7CiHZaCTM695VXD0cvmtj_w874s/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nA note from experience, since we are in the wild west I think exact budgets don't work(hence the beautiful rounded 20K KSM), we have **always** lost money, sometimes more than 30% of received funds, we made mistakes and learned a lot but it hasn't been because of financial ineptitude but because building in the crypto space is tricky, a lot of times it's crazy price fluctuations but it can also be due to swapping funds to a not-so-stable stable coin for example, a lot can happen! [... a few thoughts on the topic](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-better-treasury-system/291/4?u=olanod).  \nHopefully Kreivo can make payments for projects and services more convenient 🤞",

We started this channel about a year ago and we have already published 34 videos on our youtube channel. Our weekly viewing growth had been over 28 percent which led us to approximately 30,000 views in a year. Recently we’ve also received great support from the Council Members of Polkadot and Kusama through tip endorsements. We are really thankful to the community members who supported us and assisted us in making great content.\n\nJust last year we learned that people want to know about governance, about networks but they don’t have any resources to walk them through it. We decided to create basic videos during our early days and this has helped users to explore the Polkadot stack. They expressed their gratitude through likes and comments on our videos. Our main focus is to teach the Polkadot stack as well as governance in layman's terms to the Hindi audience.\n\nOur first milestone was covered by WagMedia but we are looking to continue the work with a spending proposal.\n\nYou can learn more about our proposal from the document. Let the community know if you have any questions. We are happy to answer them.\n\n\n[Describedot ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnweYrk-ooQqfbha_EJUy9qYx3KDN3mk6PZVM7k0UPM/edit)\n\nPS : We will make sure to return the remaining amount to the Kusama treasury.\n\n",

      "content": "Replacement of [Referendum #11](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/11)\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC. It is an alternative to subxt, which provides a similar functionality. RPC clients are needed in any software component, connecting to a substrate parachain. Therefore it is advisable, that there is more than one client available for Rust developers. Apart from that, the substrate-api-client fills a gap, providing the possibility to create extrinsics in a no_std-environment. Thereby facilitating extrinsic creation from within trusted hardware (like Intel sgx). This has a big potential for further usage in IoT environments. Last but not least, the substrate-api-client has an easy-to-use interface and comes with many practical examples, which makes it a good option for new developers.\n\nThis proposal aims to fund:\n\n1. maintenance and support for the substrate api client over 3 months (Nov-22 until Jan-23).\n\n2. evaluation and design of two new features:\n     - CLI-wallet implementation\n     - full no_std-compatibility\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1923) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJzzmimz_pjK-_4TunKvs-i2Zot2_9Ob3qUr7BlzaNo/edit?usp=sharing) for the details.\n",

      "title": "[Resubmission proposal 4] Treasury Proposal: Ordum | Public Good Grants Aggregator for Polkadot and Kusama",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nWe are resubmitting our proposal due to issues with the UX indicating enacment 3 years from now. The previous proposal can be viewed [here](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/4).\n\nOrdum is a public good grants aggregator for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. This proposal addresses the funding of R&D.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThere is no existing software besides Gitcoin to publish, apply for and manage grants. Gitcoin focuses on a quadratic funding model, while there is a need for an overall indexer and management software for grants in web3.\n\nAfter reading the Builders Program [post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/builders-programs/226) on the Polkadot Forum and speaking with other members of the community (including councillors, Web3 Foundation, and members of Shokunin Network), it was evident that a grants aggregator is imperative for bringing projects into the ecosystem as well as scaling it.\n\nIn order to construct a rich and independent environment of public goods and DAOs, it is fundamental for teams to easily find and acquaint themselves with treasuries and foundations.\n\n**Problem**\n\n- Treasuries / foundations(eg. Polkadot Treasury) are burning funds as there are not enough projects to support.\n\n- Grants information and guidelines within the ecosystems are scattered and therefore difficult to find (there are only 2 places where we have a somewhat overview of these; Polkadot/Kusama documentation and Web3 Foundation Github).\n\n- It is difficult to publicly track (grant) funding for different stages of project development. This has previously resulted in conflicts within the community.\n\n- There isn’t a unified public record to privately / publicly manage and display a grant recipient’s quality and outcome of delivery (scattered documentation).\n\n- With GOV2 incoming, further research is required on tracking proposals and deliverables in order to determine the appropriate UX.\n\n**Solution**\n\nSuccess for Ordum is the deliverance of all milestones and a V1 POC of a public goods grant aggregator.\n**\nA dapp which contains all grants from the ecosystems.**\n\n- Index data from treasuries in the ecosystem by building custom APIs(Subsquids) for tracking proposals\n- Integrate Github in the front end for tracking and submitting non-treasury grants\n- Building and maintaining light clients for quick data retrivals, security and low loading times\n- Enable log in with multiple DID services, Github and Wallets\n\n**Minting of non-transferable NFTs as “certificates” for completed milestones. Each token would contain information on what was executed and how it was evaluated.**\n\n- Ordum will be built on Phala to leverege the chains privacy capabilities and Phat smart contracts\n- Create a connection between DID (foundation)–> Phala Smart Contract–> Non-transferable NFT–>DID (recipient)\n- Design a custom type of RMRK non-transferable NFT, stored on Crust, containing reports from the foundations on milestone delivery\n**\nDelivery of milestones, grant applications and funding are displayed on a team’s profile for transparency.**\n\n- Front end displaying funding amounts and certificates within a roadmap\n\n**Issuing surveys and analyzing / feedback data for the purpose of aggregating and managing treasury grants in the most optimal way.**\n\n- Design the optimal UX through collaboration with other teams in the ecosystem\n\nRequested funding 78,804 USD // 2770 KSM\nKusama rate EMA7 as per 12th of December 2022, 11.00 (and reimburstment of submission and decision deposit)\n\nThe full proposal can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/@XyloDrone/Ordum)\n\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback.\n",

      "content": "The InvArch Network team seeks to provide the ecosystem with a new multi-signature solution, named Saturn, **available to every parachain & implementable throughout any dApp on those parachains**. This multi-signature solution will be made so that it can be **easily adopted by existing wallets in the ecosystem** & be immediately implemented to provide a superior multi-signature solution to the Dotsama ecosystem **compared to external solutions such as Gnosis Safe**.\n\nMulti-party ownership solutions are the core of nearly every project being developed by the InvArch Network team, which has heavily influenced the design of the network’s infrastructure. While sharing our proposed multi-signature implementation with other builders & community members throughout the ecosystem, we have received tremendous interest & support. We also had a meeting with a member (Ricardo) from Parity Technologies in the past regarding our solution and received positive feedback on its capabilities.\n\nThe current multi-signature implementations available for builders in the ecosystem either rely on the current implementation used in the original multi-sig Pallet developed by Parity (which is limiting) or by developing their own custom solutions (which is time-consuming & costly). The ecosystem also lacks account-recovery capabilities & the ability to onboard & off-board new members of a multi-signature implementation. This is a very restricting problem, with concerns being shared across the Kusama community. We would like to change this current reality.\n\nWhat we are proposing to build for the ecosystem is designed to service the entirety of Kusama & its parachains. We are providing it in a way that individuals will never need to purchase TNKR (optional, though) & can use KSM. **This is an open-source solution for Kusama and a solution that we truly believe will be a big boost for the ecosystem.** We are confident that if trusted by the community to deliver this solution, Kusama will go from having one of the worst multi-sig experiences in Web3 to one of the best, if not the best. Public interest in the potential for our multi-sig has been shared by the community in the past, and we would be extremely grateful if the community will signal their support for us to build this for Kusama.\n\n- A full overview of the proposal & cost breakdown can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQLhnD3l0K5fYQN9_ECiHUeQZT_lTN4FvWkkPKIWy8mVGvhvKwmjwrMIlwHCVlitA0ovWyF2Qvaplfu/pub)\n\n- A link to the public discussion previously posted regarding this proposal can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2031).",

      "content": "The substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC. It is an alternative to subxt, which provides a similar functionality. RPC clients are needed in any software component, connecting to a substrate parachain. Therefore it is advisable, that there is more than one client available for Rust developers. Apart from that, the substrate-api-client fills a gap, providing the possibility to create extrinsics in a no_std-environment. Thereby facilitating extrinsic creation from within trusted hardware (like Intel sgx). This has a big potential for further usage in IoT environments. Last but not least, the substrate-api-client has an easy-to-use interface and comes with many practical examples, which makes it a good option for new developers.\n\nThis proposal aims to fund:\n\n1. maintenance and support for the substrate api client over 3 months (Nov-22 until Jan-23).\n\n2. evaluation and design of two new features:\n     - CLI-wallet implementation\n     - full no_std-compatibility\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1923) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miIIMyHsNzdoZejVdBiV_u3NLyj7CHsr9uWBdKonrtQ/edit?usp=sharing) for the details.\n",

      "title": " Treasury Proposal: Ordum | Public Good Grants Aggregator for Polkadot and Kusama ",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nOrdum is a public good grants aggregator for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. This proposal addresses the funding of R&D.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is no existing software besides Gitcoin to publish, apply for and manage grants. Gitcoin focuses on a quadratic funding model, while there is a need for an overall indexer and management software for grants in web3.\n\nAfter reading the Builders Program post(https://forum.polkadot.network/t/builders-programs/226) on the Polkadot Forum and speaking with other members of the community (including councillors, Web3 Foundation, and members of Shokunin Network), it was evident that a grants aggregator is imperative for bringing projects into the ecosystem as well as scaling it.\n\nIn order to construct a rich and independent environment of public goods and DAOs, it is fundamental for teams to easily find and acquaint themselves with treasuries and foundations.\n\nProblem\n\nTreasuries / foundations(eg. Polkadot Treasury) are burning funds as there are not enough projects to support.\n\nGrants information and guidelines within the ecosystems are scattered and therefore difficult to find (there are only 2 places where we have a somewhat overview of these; Polkadot/Kusama documentation and Web3 Foundation Github).\n\nIt is difficult to publicly track (grant) funding for different stages of project development. This has previously resulted in conflicts within the community.\n\nThere isn’t a unified public record to privately / publicly manage and display a grant recipient’s quality and outcome of delivery (scattered documentation).\n\nWith GOV2 incoming, further research is required on tracking proposals and deliverables in order to determine the appropriate UX.\n\nSolution\n\nSuccess for Ordum is the deliverance of all milestones and a V1 POC of a public goods grant aggregator.\n\n1. A dapp which contains all grants from the ecosystems.\n\n    Index data from treasuries in the ecosystem by building custom APIs(Subsquids) for tracking proposals\n    Integrate Github in the front end for tracking and submitting non-treasury grants\n    Building and maintaining light clients for quick data retrivals, security and low loading times\n    Enable log in with multiple DID services, Github and Wallets\n\n2. Minting of non-transferable NFTs as “certificates” for completed milestones. Each token would contain information on what was executed and how it was evaluated.\n\n    Ordum will be built on Phala to leverege the chains privacy capabilities and Phat smart contracts\n    Create a connection between DID (foundation)–> Phala Smart Contract–> Non-transferable NFT–>DID (recipient)\n    Design a custom type of RMRK non-transferable NFT, stored on Crust, containing reports from the foundations on milestone delivery\n\n3. Delivery of milestones, grant applications and funding are displayed on a team’s profile for transparency.\n\n    Front end displaying funding amounts and certificates within a roadmap\n\n4. Issuing surveys and analyzing / feedback data for the purpose of aggregating and managing treasury grants in the most optimal way.\n\n    Design the optimal UX through collaboration with other teams in the ecosystem(interviews, surveys)\n\nRequested funding 78,804 USD \nKusama rate EMA7 as per 24th of November 2022: 25.24 (and reimburstment of submission and decision deposit)\n\nThe full proposal can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/@XyloDrone/Ordum)\n\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback.",

      "content": "As we navigate OpenGov, we re finding new things: it seems this referendum #2 wont enact succesfully, because the call we used (treasury.ApproveProposal) will only be enacted successfully with root origin, which is the case.\n\nWe will need to resubmit this proposal:\n\n    on Treasurer track (same one)\n    with the call treasury.Spend (including the amount in KSM for the allocation)\n\nThe proposal has now been [resubmitted here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/big-spender/5). \n\n----\n\n\nHi Community,\n\nWe recently launched [Polkawatch decentralization analytics on Kusama](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1578348493303083008), and [Nomination Pools](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1583591038572036098) support.\n\nThe community is becoming more and more aware of the need for effective decentralization in our Ecosystem.\n\nThe interest peaked with a recent[ deplatforming event of Solana nodes](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1588130270917627910) by a Network operator. \n\nWe are been contacted by other teams of our community: Wallets, Parachains, Data Scientists, etc That want access to the data and help contribute to bringing awareness to the ecosystem. Which I think is good news.\n\nParachains are secured by the rely chain, but they are still vulnerable to censorship. Censorship could come from dishonest collators, deplatforming from network operators or sudden regulatory changes from hosting Countries. Despite been secured by the rely chain, parachains would benefit from decentralization analytics too.\n\nOn this proposal we aim to bring parachain support for Polkawatch, on top of continued operation of the service and other minor improvements.\n\nThe proposal has been for [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1942) here.\n\nWe were invited to participate in [AAG#11](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1595083537107009537) where an interesting discussion followed\n\nCommunity feedback has been incorporated to the proposal.\n\nYou can access the [detailed proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljvYDuazbNBgjf94yFUbUEdeyBN5ixG6BXAEKxuxmL4/edit?usp=sharing) here.\n",
