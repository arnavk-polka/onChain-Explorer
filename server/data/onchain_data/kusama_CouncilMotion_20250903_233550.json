      "content": "With OpenGov up and running on Kusama, the current auctions [schedule](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/438) suffers an enactment issue: all pending auctions won’t enact successfully, although scheduled, due to a `BadOrigin` error: [https://kusama.subscan.io/block/15523200?tab=event&&event=15523200-16](https://kusama.subscan.io/block/15523200?tab=event&&event=15523200-16). This is because with OpenGov, an auction needs the [`AuctionAdmin` origin](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.32/runtime/kusama/src/lib.rs#L1245) to be enacted successfully, but the original auctions for LP25 had the origin of more than 3/5 Council. ```  [    [      15,724,800    ]    [      {        maybeId: 0xf31cf33afabfc39818c20e858c4ceded9bf70cb3d29d460adc468af33853873c        priority: 0        call: {          Inline: 0x4800e2a5010068        }        maybePeriodic: [          100,800          2        ]        origin: {          Council: {            Members: [              13              19            ]          }        }      }    ]  ]```With this new proposal we aim to include the last auctions on LP26 + the ones what were not enacted on LP25, now to be included on LP27. A new calendar for auctions will be proposed soon in OpenGov, but since this one is a legacy proposal, approved by the community and not working due to a problem with origins, It would be ideal to fast-track to enact ASAP. - Proposal Hash: `0x3f303aa09336575dd393dd38f26b1db6fe46eb8fb082b6abae93aa2bf79cd0e3`- Primate submission: [https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/15580971-7](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/15580971-7) - Image can be found [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x1804081d052bd1e9469fc73e572f6019b15ab507656fa8b34937ee212544eb877c5c6dd0da0000000001c089010004000000004800e2a50100681d05337955059e29e88811a9ffbbcdc33a57bb70ce142b89f935fbeb795507e3f2482043060001c089010002000000004800e2a501006c)",

This included: \n- [Genshiro's proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/democracy/referendum/246) to swap slots, already approved by the community and on dispatch queue.\n- [Kintsugi’s proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/242) to open an HRMP channel with Statemine, already approved by the community and on dispatch queue.\n\nIn order to make sure the approval by the community is held as true, we aim to vote again on these two proposals to have then enacted as decided by the community, in time. For this, the proposal is composed by a `batch` call including: a `forceOpenHrmpChannel` (for Kintsugi and Statemine) with a `forceTransfer` call from treasury to pay for the cost of the channel opening, and a `registrarSwap` call (for Genshiro). We aim to vote this ASAP to pass it to vote. Preimage is submitted. \n\n- Call hash: `0x83c439b8b621a3507c90c8a3ebd0c4b3d76962f853e1f11858e665aeafaeac14`\n- Call data: `0x1804140402006d6f646c70792f747273727900000000000000000000000000000000000000000070617261e80300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b00a0724e18093c07e80300002c080000e8030000009001003c072c080000e8030000e8030000009001004603b2080000e80700004603e8070000b2080000`\n- Composition can be found [HERE](https://i.ibb.co/b6VZ48J/Screenshot-2022-11-23-at-15-29-48.png) and [HERE](https://i.ibb.co/pn03Ssm/Screenshot-2022-11-23-at-15-29-56.png).\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!

      "title": "Treasury Proposal: Production of Dotsama ecosystem tutorial videos for Hindi audience",
      "content": "Hello everyone, I am Hitesh from Describedot. We create educational videos and weekly updates around the Dotsama ecosystem. We started this channel about a year ago and we have already published 34 videos on our youtube channel. Our weekly viewing growth had been over 28 percent which led us to approximately 30,000 views in a year. Recently we’ve also received great support from the Council Members of Polkadot and Kusama through tip endorsements. We are really thankful to the community members who supported us and assisted us in making great content.\n\nJust last year we learned that people want to know about governance, about networks but they don’t have any resources to walk them through it. We decided to create basic videos during our early days and this has helped users to explore the Polkadot stack. They expressed their gratitude through likes and comments on our videos. Our main focus is to teach the Polkadot stack as well as governance in layman's terms to the Hindi audience.\n\nOur first milestone was covered by WagMedia but we are looking to continue the work with a spending proposal. \n\nYou can learn more about our proposal from the document. Let the community know if you have any questions. We are happy to answer them\n\n[Describedot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnweYrk-ooQqfbha_EJUy9qYx3KDN3mk6PZVM7k0UPM/edit)",

      "content": "Dear Council,\n\nPresently there are eight collators on Statemine, four of them are operated by Parity as invulnerables and the other four are operated by public entities.  This proposal seeks to reduce the allocation of invulnerables to two and increase the number of publicly occupied slots to eight.   For reference and later comparison, State**mint** posses two invulnerable collators and six from the public.\n\nThe rationale is two fold, in the spirit of decentralization I am suggesting we reduce reliance on Parity (invulnerables) and shift to the public.  Secondly, as a matter of fulfilling the purpose of a canary; we should try to mimic or preferably advance beyond the allocations of Statemint.\n\nThe XCM message comprises of two encoded calls:\n\nSet Candidates to 8 - `0x150108000000`\n\nand \n\nReduce Invulnerables to two -`0x15000850673d59020488a4ffc9d8c6de3062a65977046e6990915617f85fef6d349730fe8102dbc244e7ea2babd9f53236d67403b046154370da5c3ea99def0bd0747a`\n\n\n",

      "content": "Full proposal with UI screenshots and all details can be found here: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rnlNk7eka984UXmfNk0Mkdkf94jL1m3aWS8IeedgyY/)\n\nTwitter thread/feedbacks: https://twitter.com/RemarkPunks/status/1587922570828951553\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Summary**\n\nKusaMint is a development kit for NFT artists, collection makers and the whole Kusama community in general. It provides different tools to mint and manage NFTs with ease.\n\nOur goal is to make NFT creation easy for people who don’t have programming skills. Let anyone mint advanced NFTs with an accessible UI which in return will expand the Kusama NFT community with more talented artists and collectors who were scared by the complexity of mints before.\n\nCurrently KusaMint is adjusted for RMRK 2.0, but as development continues, it will scale to RMRK X.0 and other protocols operating in Dotsama.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Features**\n\n- ### **2.0 NFT Minter**\nAn easy to use UI that opens a whole new set of possibilities to new users. The minter will constantly expand its functionality and applications as development goes. \n\nCurrently you can create NFTs with multiple types of resources:\n\n1. **Base resource (Parent)** - the main “Base” of your composable NFT. Child resources will be equipped onto it.\n\n2. **Slot resource (Child)** - these resources allow one NFT to be added on the other one. This can result in NFTs with “equipment”, art with multiple layers, different effects and a lot more depending on the user's creativity.\n\n3. **Common** - classic, non-functional resource. \n\nMoreover, our Minter allows to:\nCreate Soulbound NFTs\nInherit metadata from other NFTs\nMass-mint multi-resourced NFTs\nSet royalties and royalty receiver\nMint directly to another wallet or NFT\nReplace and update resources\nCreate and manage your base\n\n- ### **Snapshotter**\n\nCreate collection snapshots in a simple and comfortable way to get a list of every NFT with its holder details (csv/json)\n\n1. **Lite**-  NFTs & Owners \n\n2. **Advanced**-  NFT with details & Owners with identity\n\n- ### **Notification Bot Factory**\n\nIn a few clicks you can create a sales bot that will read remarks and track your collection sales and floor prices. \n\nConfigure your own bots on all the popular social media: Twitter, Discord and Telegram.\n\n-----------------------\n\n- **Details**\n\nFull proposal: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rnlNk7eka984UXmfNk0Mkdkf94jL1m3aWS8IeedgyY)\n\nMore information about our projects: [Link>>](https://canarys-nest.gitbook.io/ultimate-canarys-nest-wiki/ecosystem/canarys-nest)\n\n**First Milestone:**\n\n- RMRK 2.0 NFT Minter\n- Snapshotter\n- Notification Bot Factory\n- Full UI design\n- Integrated Polkadot.js/Talisman Wallets\n\n**Requested Amount:** 1493 KSM/48800 USD (Coingecko data on 2nd of November 2022)\n\n**Total team hours:** 1400 Hours\n\nCosts detalization: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rnlNk7eka984UXmfNk0Mkdkf94jL1m3aWS8IeedgyY/edit#heading=h.wogmmcdsnfi9)\n\nWe are glad to see feedback on proposal as well as suggestions for extra functionality from the community and hope that this development kit will be useful for many creators in the space.\n\n",

      "content": "![](https://luckyfriday.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/lucky-friday-logo-full.png)\n\nThe Lucky Friday team seeks funding to provide RPC services for the Kusama and Statemine networks. We are well established within the ecosystem, operating numerous geo-diverse validators, collators, miners, and vaults on Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nOur team intends to provide RPC services at our SOC 2 Type 2, CCSS-compliant facilities, co-located on dedicated bare-metal servers. We are investing significant capital upfront, believing we can offer reliable and secure unmetered service to the community at a fixed and reasonable cost.\n\nOur decades of data center experience – and desire to encourage ecosystem growth – means that we recognize and are concerned about the risk of centralization happening due to the haste of quickly turning up nodes in AWS, Google Cloud, and others. Hetzner has already begun shutting down crypto-related activities.\n\nWe desire to leverage our high-performance, high-availability infrastructure, and scalability to support the Dotsama ecosystem by providing the enterprise-level connectivity needed to serve an ever-growing userbase and support influential applications like Polkadot.js, Talisman, PolkaGate, Nova, and more.\n\nThe full proposal ([available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNh6kpdXcW0ZJ1ta9rjFtYQ0DZVg7TOBUepJco5LbWk/edit \"Lucky Friday RPC Proposal – Council Submission\")) was posted for discussion ([post 1934](../post/1934 \"Lucky Friday | Cost-Effective Proposal for High-Performance Bare-Metal RPC Nodes\")) on November 4, 2022, and has received very positive feedback, with 21 likes and 0 dislikes.\n\nAs outlined, we seek initial funding of $11,200 (402.95 KSM based on EMA7). Upon successful completion of milestones as set out in the proposal, we will report on our undertaking and provide details on load tests. We would then further engage for monthly recurring costs of $14,920 (requested quarterly).\n\nDue to the extreme nature of recent market volatility, we understand that the requested KSM may fall short or exceed the dollar amount needed. If we fall short, we would like to include this amount in our following proposal to continue RPC service. If we are in excess, we will return the balance of funds to the treasury.",

The first part of the funding has already passed as [Motion 510](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/510). The current proposal is the second of two and shall cover the funding from beginning of October to the end of December 2022. Encointer’s common good lease lasts until end of lease period 25, which is currently expected by Dec 12th 2022. Please also consider our [request for common good lease renewal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1900)\n\nThe amount of the proposed treasury spend is CHF 257’500 = **USD 261'491** \n\nEncointer has onboarded as a common good parachain on Kusama on Jan 9th 2022. Please find our earlier progress reports here:\n1. Our recent [treasury proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTyZGCTCzo7ZGonVtAmJmc5QYYI0qYHab6z8w56B_F0) includes a detailed report on what we have achieved until June 2022 and what our plans are for the future\n2. Our [delivery report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/510#3f6f0d94-639f-49ec-a0ee-1f4ace1a37c8) on above treasury grant updates the information with achievements in the June-Sept 2022 period\n \nThe main focus of Encointer is currently:\n\n* to grow its Zurich community in order to prove the viability of its protocol and implementation as well as its economics with a pioneer community.\n* to onboard new communities around the world, especially in less developed regions in order to follow its vision.\n* to integrate with other parachains in the DotSama ecosystem for sybil-defense, inclusivity and one-person-one-vote democracy.\n\nAs a common-good, Encointer has no way to promise any return on investment, so the project relies on grants and donations.\n\nSee our [Proposal with full details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18J6qN0vRNjCpII4BAgitjav0O2JbgV6vCvsKfdQGkFg/edit#heading=h.3mhoboeg6pv8)\n\n",

      "title": "Further funding for Proof of Chaos",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nThe Proof of Chaos (formerly Governance Participation Rewards) project incentivises voting to decentralise Kusama. We reward referenda voters with NFTs and build out tools to increase governance participation. [Our website](https://www.proofofchaos.app/)\n\nThank you for supporting the project thus far!\n![](https://i.ibb.co/qYKrW5K/download.jpg)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Kj2xxt5/newplot-17.png)\n\nWe would like to give you an update on what we have been up to over the past 3.5 months and hope to be granted additional funds for continued development of tools that improve voter participation and make the project more fun, fair and engaging.\n\nTo achieve this goal we would like to onboard two great developers ([niftesty](https://twitter.com/niftesty) on frontend / next.js & Thomas on backend work) for fixed term contributions: 40h/month. They have built our current website and their focus will be to build it out further. I (Gabriel) will be scaling back a bit on the development side and focusing on operations a.k.a. the rewards themselves. My mission specifically will be to make the rewards more engaging and work on utility use cases.\n\nWith a focus on increasing the value of our collection(s) we aim to boost our revenues and get to a self-sustaining level faster. We are also working on more revenue streams to ensure more predictable and constant income.\n\nA large chunk of the funds is for past project management expenses that we have not been able to cover with our revenues. While I (Gabriel) always ensure that we have enough funds to pay everyone else involved with the project, I made the deliberate decision from the start to align my interests with that of the project: meaning I should only be rewarded if the project is successful.\n \nRather than asking for payment upfront, I do the work first and only ask the treasury to help out when our revenues fall short. Through this structure I of course take the risk of the community not deeming the project worthy of additional funds and thus I am incentivized to ensure that the project continues to perform well. At the same time the community only pays for what they get. For transparency I would like to highlight that I have increased the hourly rate to 80 USD (up from 70 last time). This is the rate that the other developers involved with the project are also charging and thus I hope you find the change appropriate.\n\nKindly take a look at the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cMIzdxSd1Tf9T5KZvVLQfyvn4gxLSuCKGl7JXbOKaoo/edit?usp=sharing) and what we are looking to build with the extra funding. We appreciate any and all feedback.\n\nYou can find the post up for community discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1896).",

This experiment turned out to be a success so we want to make it something formal and constant.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the creation of “Polkadot Forms”, a series of forms and tests, both in English and Spanish, that will allow the community to learn and test their knowledge in a dynamic way. Each form will deal with a specific topic of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem and will be distributed weekly during the months of November, December and January.\n\nThe goal of these test sets is to keep the community active in learning about the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem and motivate them using a healthy and positive contest dynamic. All this to create a formed community and appeal to new users who want to learn in an original and fun way.\n\nYou can see the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14q40d19SVQCyyLPFGdpS5ARJ6qh668YlgujI9RTgcrw/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nFurther community feedback may be found on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/SrSlayer_/status/1580544411661791232?s=20&t=IHaPLGeaAxt3eB7RI_H7Vg).\n\nOriginal post discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1883).",

My background is in engineering and finance and for the last two years, I’ve been working in the crypto VC space. \n\nOver the past few months, I became active in the DAO ecosystem and as I explored the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems - I learned that managing funds via a Multisig is a major pain point for the communities building in the DotSama space because of the lack of a user-friendly Multisig UX. In order to facilitate DAO growth, my team and I are building PolkaSafe on top of Polkadot {.js}'s security backbone while improving all of its current drawbacks.\n\n### Short description \n\nPolkaSafe will be building a user-friendly Multisig wallet UI for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. With the mission of bringing digital asset users closer to the Dotsama ecosystem and enabling them to safely manage and transfer their tokens, we are focusing on building a product that will provide a great UX for users to interact with the Multisig feature built-in Polkadot.js\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RhWVcmx/Screenshot-2022-10-11-at-11-57-20-AM.png)\n\nRead the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJyqo9Py3Tv_N9nw3D1Ggpkxk0ZfHuT9NnnIwMdv1pU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n",

Both governances will coexist in one version of the app, with clear indication of the governance version related to each mechanism.\n\nProject Link : https://treasury.bright.dev\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\n## The team behind it\n\nBright Inventions is a team of over 70 developers, project managers, UX/UI designers and operations specialists - experts in mobile and web applications, systems integration, IOT devices and Blockchain platforms.\n\nWe believe that building a software product is about people working together in a collective way. By offering complex support – mobile and web development as well as IT consultancy we try to eliminate roadblocks towards engaging clients as partners at every step of the process.\n\nWe support startups, digital agencies as well as medium to big businesses. We cooperate with startups, accelerators and incubators. Whatever the client profile is, we always aim to establish a satisfying partnership for both sides. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide.\n\nThe BrightTreasury team currently consists of:\n\nŁukasz Kuderewski - fullstack developer He is an optimist, always willing to learn new things. Mechatronics engineer who fell in love with programming. He has always been interested in a holistic approach to programming problems, which is why after working as a frontend, he is now fulfilled as a fullstack.\n\nRobert Koprowski - fullstack developer, blockchain specialist He is an experienced and ambitious blockchain enthusiast. Graduated from the University of Edinburgh, he lived in various locations around the world to settle now in Gdańsk. Originally a Backend Developer who decided to extend his skills and become Fullstack Developer, always trying to learn something new.\n\nPavel Jankoski - fullstack developer. Communicative team player interested in finding solutions to complex problems. From the very beginning he started working as a fullstack developer and tried many different frameworks which makes him a fast learner eager to uncover new technologies. He enjoys contributing in flexible environments that allow him to explore new cultures, together with colleagues from different countries.\n\nJoanna Cieszyńska - a product designer. She’s passionate about user-centered design and likes to pay attention to the accessibility aspects of it. Just wants to make sure the products she’s responsible for are inclusive and users get equal access to information, functionality, and experience of digital products.\n\nKatarzyna Łukasiewicz - Project Manager. She has been working with agile methods for over 10 years, both as a researcher and a practitioner. She believes in teamwork and a power of user centered mindset. With experience in leading international projects, she knows how to support and encourage timely and high quality deliveries.\n\n## Costs and budget\n\nThe work will be divided into 3 milestones. In each milestone, the whole team, as desribed in the previous section, will be working in Sprints, following Scrum approach. Łukasz and Robert are expected to be engaged full time, Pavel half-time, whereas Katarzyna and Joanna will be engaged part-time. The following cost includes all the necessary development, management and design work to reach the defined goals.\n\n\n**Milestone 1**\n\nDisplay the gov 2.0 proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n\nTime: 3 weeks\nCost: 16 000 USD\n\nThe goal of this milestone is to get the gov 2.0 proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips from chain and display them in BrightTreasury.\n\nThe proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips from both governance versions will be displayed in one overview, with appropriate label: Gov 2.0 or Gov 1.0. They will be sorted by date. Users will be able to filter out only Gov 2.0 or Gov 1.0 proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips as well.\n\nWe plan to complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Checking the gov version support in Kusama net + fetch configuration (when booting the app)\n\n3. List of proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n\n- Fetching proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips from gov2.0 & gov1.0\n- Handling IDs (may be duplicated)\n- Changes in react routing pattern for proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n- Changes in nest controllers for proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n- Front+backend communication\n- Difference in design for two gov versions (label) for proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n\nOut of scope - history of Gov 2.0 proposals.\n\n**Milestone 2**\n\nDisplay the gov 2.0 proposal/bounties/tips details\n\n Time: 1 week\nCost: 5 000 USD\n\nThe goal of this milestone is to fetch and display the Gov 2.0 proposal/bounties/tips details.\n\nCurrently in BrightTreasury the results of a motion for a given proposal are presented in the Votings tab, in the proposal’s detailed overview. We’ll keep this form of presentation for both governance versions. When user visits the detailed overview of a Gov 1.0 proposal, the Votings tab will continue to show the results of a motion. When user visits the detailed overview of a Gov 2.0 proposal, the Votings tab will display the results of the appropriate referendum.\n\nWe plan to complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Information on the governance version (label)\n2. Voting results - add the new referenda for Gov 2.0 proposals/bounties/tips\n\n**Milestone 3**\nCreating and converting Idea/Bounty/Tip in the new Governance 2.0 version\n\n\n Time: 2 weeks\nCost: 10 000 USD\n\nThe main goal of this milestone is to allow creating and converting Idea/Bounty/Tip in the new Governance 2.0 version.\n\nUser will be able to choose the governance version, however by default the choice will be set up as Gov 2.0, with information about it being the preferred option. For each governance version, the submission will be handled appropriately.\n\nWe plan to complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Add governance version choice\n2. Calculating bond based on gov version\n3. Handle different calls for each gov version when submitting proposal\n4. Milestones/child bounties Inherit the gov version from their Idea for each network",

      "title": "External motion: Approval of Treasury Proposal 212 - Fearless Wallet Desktop/Browser Plugin Proposal",
      "content": "Taking into account the discussion and aiming to achieve consensus, **an external motion** puts forward the vote for treasury proposal by **Fearless**, focused on a browser extension for Chrome and Mozilla, as well as a desktop application for windows, which includes asset, wallet and network management flows, dApp connector logic support and more. Note that this is **an external motion**, leaving the final decision up for the community vote as a referendum. Further information can be found on the [motion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/561). The team is here to answer any questions or comments. \n\nAll info on the treasury proposal can be reviewed below.\n______________________________________________________________\n\n### #212 Fearless Wallet Desktop/Browser Plugin Proposal\n\n- Link to the original proposal can be found [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/212).\n\n- The discussion on the proposal, DMCA action and open source license of the code can be found [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/551) and [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1817) (reason why this proposal is submitted on-chain as an external motion). \n\nThis proposal is focused on:\n\n- A browser extension application for Chrome, all chromium based browsers (that support browser extensions) and Mozilla Firefox. In terms of the proposal, our team will design and develop a Browser extension application with a widget style interface that is compatible with and similar to (some extent) the Fearless Wallet mobile app (iOS/Android).\n\n- A desktop application for Windows, macOS and Linux. Using Electron SDK it is possible to build Desktop apps for various operating systems with little effort. These desktop apps can be built from the same code base as the aforementioned Browser extension.\n\n- Wallet, network and asset management flows. We will cover the most important and necessary flows such as: wallet creation and import, handling many wallets, switching between several networks along with the “All networks” state, The main asset flows such as: send, receive, transaction history, teleport (cross-chain transfer), buy assets for fiat by means of Moonpay and RAMP services will also be covered.\n\n- Settings and chain account management flows. Main wallet flows aside, users need to have tools to manage their wallets, chain accounts, localisation, currencies, nodes, etc. The “Settings” set of features will be a solution to that. More detailed information about the corresponding flows is provided below in Section 3. Feature set of the proposal.\n\n- dApp connector logic support. We will develop a service that will allow a direct connection between the Fearless Wallet (iOS/Android) application and Browser extension to sign all dApp transactions.\n\nThe amount requested for the first submission is $268,400.00. The amount in KSM is 6,389.41 taking into account KSM EMA (7) rate provided by Subscan service KSM prices (USD) for October, 3rd. The amount will be recalculated according to the 7 day average KSM rate, using the high and low of the week on Coingecko, at the day of on-chain action after the discussion process ends.\n\n**The 1st milestone includes:**\n\n- Browser extension for Chrome, all chromium based browsers and Mozilla Firefox\n\n- Desktop application for Windows, macOS and Linux\n\n- Wallet, network, and asset management flows\n\n- Settings and chain account management flows\n\n- dApp connector/signer logic support\n\n\n",

      "content": "Proponent: ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP\n\nDate: 6th October 2022\n\nRequested KSM: 1,295.60 KSM (USD: $59,124.98)\n\nShort description: Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\nPrevious Discussion: <https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1868>\n\nRaw Data: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eftYcA4iedfQiwwekxLvNixhksG3uNMRAU0QGAmI09Y/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nFull Report <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UW9Cg5FmYoxaT2bDCzYOpMuv-LNmzvvayfe0vgEBKlY/edit?usp=sharing>\n\n* * * * *\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (July, August, September 2022) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we've made Github issues based on behaviour we've observed)\n\n## Service Details\n\nDuring the last quarter, we've focused on three key areas for the development of OnFinality - cost optimization, network expansion, and providing more value from our Ultimate API service.\n\nThe bear market has made many of our customers more price sensitive, and as such we've been working with them to optimise our services to provide more for less. We've reduced prices for our larger customers between 30 and 40%, and created products designed to target and onboard new chains with entry level pricing. We've also been working on new rate limiting capabilities to progressively restrict abusers of our public APIs to upgrade to paid API plans.\n\nIn the past quarter we have succeeded in our goal of onboarding two new networks, with the addition of Avalanche and Juno to our API service. This was a large amount of upfront work, extending OnFinality to allow chains outside of Polkadot/Substrate, but now that it has been done we should be able to move faster and onboard new chains each week. We hope that this means that we will be able to invite as many new ecosystem participants into Polkadot as possible with this expansion. \n\nFinally, providing move value from our Ultimate API service has always been a priority, and in this space we've added new API specific paid plans at competitive prices to our competition. We have also delivered the ability for our customers to better understand and learn about their users, with API Insights that tell you where your users are, what they are requesting, what methods are failing (to find bugs in your dApp), and where optimisations can occur.\n\nWe continued to execute on our efforts to provide unprecedented service stability and reliability to this ecosystem. All supported networks exceeded our 99.9% target, including 99.94% uptime for Kusama over the last 90 days . At this stage, OnFinality is operationally striving for four 9s of availability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.\n\nBetween 2022-07-01 and 2022-09-30 our Kusama API service has:\n-   **Reduced cost to the Kusama treasury while serving a similar amount of traffic**\n-   Served a total of 4.932 billion responses\n-   Accumulated almost 56 TB of data egress\n-   The highest daily total was over 102 million responses in a single 24 hour period\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 60 million responses each day.\n-   Statemine had over 364 million API responses in the period\n-   All time totals for Kusama is 35,987,582,620 (35 billion) since November, 2020\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime on Kusama and Statemine was 99.94% and 99.99% respectively\n\n## Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [API Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-introduces-api-insights-so-you-can-analyse-and-learn-about-your-applications-faster/) so you can analyse and learn about your API applications faster and find bugs with your dApp\n-   [Cost optimisations](https://blog.onfinality.io/go-further-with-more-affordable-pricing/) to reduce pricing for our customers by up to 40%\n-   [New API plans](https://blog.onfinality.io/get-ahead-with-onfinalitys-new-api-endpoints/) for our high usage customers and a way to allocate resource to [move towards a more sustainable funding model](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1815)\n-   [Support for Alibaba Cloud](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-collaborates-with-alibaba-cloud-to-provide-a-premium-experience-to-web3-builders/) to provide more decentralised cloud hosting options for our customers\n-   [Updates to our website](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-announces-a-new-ui-to-help-web3-developers-build-smarter/) to include a new Network marketplace so [you can see what networks are supported](https://onfinality.io/marketplace)\n-   Support for new layer 1s - [Avalanche](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-beta-api-support-for-avalanche/) and [Juno](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-api-support-for-jun-c3-b8-network/) (in Cosmos)\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/) and [analytics page](https://analytics.onfinality.io).\n\nFull Report <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UW9Cg5FmYoxaT2bDCzYOpMuv-LNmzvvayfe0vgEBKlY/edit?usp=sharing>",

We have reached out to few councils members for feedback.\n\nOriginal Post : [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/209](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/209)\n\nThe feedback that we got is to separate the RPC and the indexer into 2 proposals as they represents 2 different value chains. We agree and are resubmitting based on the feedback that we have received, removing RPC from the equation.\n\nCurrently, this value remained in the proposal:\n\nA Content indexer so that when people searched for educational or articles related to Kusama and Polkadot, we are able to provide a categorization and filtering value to the search result. The target audience is anyone who are interested in the above and wants to join or provide a little touch of their Likes as part of the community feedback to the indexing mechanism. This can be a lurker, a content creator or a technical learner.\n\nThe above will help to gather the information done by many content producers that are being posted in so many repeated location and provided a relevancy.\n\nThe new proposal, which can be found in below link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVOfNDEVJ29KInEzDCIPzPBW9QzavI90HjI2b2jxW1E/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVOfNDEVJ29KInEzDCIPzPBW9QzavI90HjI2b2jxW1E/)\n\nWe welcome feedback and improvement on the proposal, as at the end of day, the community will be part of us, will also be part of the scalable solution and the enrichment of the data and recommendations. We also want to offer transparency to the proposal. After all, this is supported and funded by the community.",

      "content": "@Councillors, after the team received the feedback, regrouped and answered all questions, the **PolkadotSpace** has submitted an updated proposal that has been passed for Council. Specifically, based on feedback, the team **separated the RPC service proposal and the indexer proposal** and presented the new on-chain submission by removing RPC service from the equation. Please note that with the team's agreement, the motion contains a `batch` call: _approving_ the [updated proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/217) and _rejecting_ the [previous one](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/209).\n\nThe full proposal, along with the budget and idea behind it, can be found here:\n__________________________________________\n\n\"Thanks for all the existing support that we have. We have reached out to few councils members for feedback.\n\n**Original Post:** [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/209](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/209)\n\nThe feedback that we got is to separate the RPC and the indexer into 2 proposals as they represents 2 different value chains. We agree and are resubmitting based on the feedback that we have received, removing RPC from the equation.\n\nCurrently, this value remained in the proposal:\n\nA Content indexer so that when people searched for educational or articles related to Kusama and Polkadot, we are able to provide a categorization and filtering value to the search result. The target audience is anyone who are interested in the above and wants to join or provide a little touch of their Likes as part of the community feedback to the indexing mechanism. This can be a lurker, a content creator or a technical learner.\n\nThe above will help to gather the information done by many content producers that are being posted in so many repeated location and provided a relevancy.\n\nThe new proposal, which can be found in below link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVOfNDEVJ29KInEzDCIPzPBW9QzavI90HjI2b2jxW1E/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVOfNDEVJ29KInEzDCIPzPBW9QzavI90HjI2b2jxW1E/)\n\nWe welcome feedback and improvement on the proposal, as at the end of day, the community will be part of us, will also be part of the scalable solution and the enrichment of the data and recommendations. We also want to offer transparency to the proposal. After all, this is supported and funded by the community.\n\n________________________________________\n",

Currently, on my YouTube channel you can find two main playlists, one for [Kusama](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAP3PysUxiwYGW7aHsC60TnN) and one for [Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAPR14k1-zSpznR-HSNYHaqa).\n\nAll videos made so far have been submitted to Tips and endorsed by the Council. Also, during the last few months I have been working on [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzXd7k55l-nX7cXIdwDnA1WwMIKIVCXYMLprlqMraeY/edit?usp=sharing) for the production of Kusama's educational video tutorials.\n\nThe following proposal seeks funding for the production of 64 educational videos about the Kusama ecosystem from November 2022 to April 2023. This proposal is born as an extension of the proposal mentioned above in order to expand the functionalities that make up the Kusama playlist, inform users of what happens weekly in the network governance and give them support in case they need it.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to create an informed, educated and valuable community that knows how to make real use of the network.\n\nYou can see the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u15Yub1VQxqvhf3juk8JGFr4u1BrqvH1SUgxrzBQ1bE/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nYou can check the original discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1828)",

IE: INFORMATION is \"ALL Over The Place\" from either Blogs, video site, other blogs and blogs and discussion website and sometime, social media.\n\nThere are 2 values in this proposal\n\nA Content indexer so that when people searched for educational or articles related to Kusama and Polkadot, we are able to provide a categorization and filtering value to the search result. The target audience is anyone who are interested in the above and wants to join or provide a little touch of their Likes as part of the community feedback to the indexing mechanism. This can be a lurker, a content creator or a technical learner.\n\nThe above will help to gather the information done by many content producers that are being posted in so many repeated location and provided a relevancy.\n\nRPC nodes for community which we simply want to provide more capabilities to the community and infrastructure as the usage of XCM is increasing dramatically now. In addition to that, the focus will be on Asia and North America because majority of the existing RPC are in Europe. Furthermore, we are also delivering additional archive nodes to reinforce the data footprint of the decentralized eco-system.\n\nOur current Full Proposal can be found below. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LXxklsulLc87ffkwHPzfgfQwB86efytHl2SoatRXnU](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LXxklsulLc87ffkwHPzfgfQwB86efytHl2SoatRXnU)\n\nWe welcome feedback and improvement on the proposal, as at the end of day, the community will be part of us, will also be part of the scalable solution and the enrichment of the data and recommendations. We also want to offer transparency to the proposal. Afterall, this is supported and funded by the community.",

It was built with the Dotsama ecosystem in mind and tailored to benefit its most active members. Since then, Sub.ID has been connected to over 30 Substrate chains, gained substantial traction, and got its own dedicated vision and roadmap.\n\nWe are seeking to secure funding from Kusama treasury for the following community-oriented features:\n\nBATCH ONE\n- **Collator and validator staking**: network selection, stake / unstake buttons and actions, collators / validators list, parachain / FRAME staking pallets support\n- **Staking dashboard**: staking analytics, data aggregation, APR calculation, rewards calculation\n- **Crowdloan claims**: claim buttons and actions, claim/vesting pallets support (backend/frontend), human friendly time to unlock staked tokens\n- **Cross-chain transfers**: native & cross-chain transfers (UX/frontend), tokens pallets support (native transfer), XCM pallet integration, support of EVM tokens & transfers\n\nBATCH TWO\n- Alternative balance view\n- Accounts grouping\n- Transaction history\n- P&L analytics\n\nBATCH THREE\n- Mobile app\n\nThe first allocation will only cover BATCH ONE features for now, the rest are our plans for the future.\n\nPlease review the full proposal with detailed description costs at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RElvy5RYhnNInwnGsjibedGLI3EeBoqqazKk6Syv13M/view](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RElvy5RYhnNInwnGsjibedGLI3EeBoqqazKk6Syv13M/view).

      "title": "Proposal: Dubbing “Polkadot Decoded 2022” playlist into Spanish",
      "content": "**Who?**\n\nI'm Sara and I've been dubbing the official Polkadot videos into Spanish for 9 months on the YouTube channel called [Polkadot & Kusama - Doblaje al español](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhalsQc7NrYCvYkietak7A). During the first months I was applying to Tips on Kusama’s Treasury, and for the last 3 months I’ve been working on a [Child Bounty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqm_CM8QRvvTNuxMnz4FbvX5A9C_esEWo51pEtD0mfk/edit?usp=sharing). In this proposal I’ll be working with 2 more experienced translators, and with Cervera, who will be in charge of editing the videos.\n\n**What?**\n\nDubbing of [Polkadot Decoded 2022 playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGvcE0HKKnORiFqWNv5onxCf) into Spanish. The Polkadot Decoded 2022 playlist has more than 100 videos that are equivalent to 34 hours of viewing in total.\n\n**When?**\n\nFrom October to January 2023. It’s important that the Spanish-speaking community has the content of the Decoded 2022 event as soon as possible to be aware of the news of the ecosystem.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- Misinformation. One of the most important things is that the community is informed and aware of the technology so that they can participate in it.\n\n- Lack of English proficiency in the Spanish-speaking community. According to the EF English Proficiency Index (EF EPI), 60.6% of the Spanish-speaking population have low/moderate English proficiency. The remaining percentage is not fluent in English.\n\n- Little content about Polkadot in Spanish. Most of the content about Polkadot and its ecosystem is in English.\n\n- Content subtitled, but not dubbed. Dubbing offers users greater convenience because they don’t have to follow the reading with their eyes.\n\n- Blind Spanish-speaking people who aren’t proficient in English don’t have access to information. From experience in my family, Spanish-speaking blind people who aren’t proficient in English and want to learn need audio content in Spanish about the ecosystem.\n\n- Information may be distorted when passing through third parties. This causes the user to be misinformed.\n\n**Amount requested:**\n1,158.47 KSM ($51,158.3) (KSM/USD on the EMA7 on Subscan at the time of submission)\n\n**Marketing & Success metrics:**\nSEO. Reach an average of 250k views in total with all episodes. These videos will be accessible to any user through the Polkadot & Kusama - Doblaje al español channel, and will be available for any member to share through other channels and/or platforms (such as Polkadot Hub or the Polkadot en Español channel on YouTube).\n\n**More information?

      "title": "Bounty #3 Top-up Request",
      "content": "## Overview\n\n[Bounty #3](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/3) aims to provide a signing solution to bridge the dApps and mobile wallets, which using Beacon Network as a decentralized peer-to-peer network of nodes based on the matrix protocol, with trustless and encrypted message relaying.\n\nThe bounty includes the integration with Beacon SDK with Substrate-based Network, and the integration with Wallet in both iOS and Android. Overall the bounty is completed by the Beacon team, Fearless Wallet team, and Nova Wallet by June 2022.\n\nThe bounty includes relatively more work which could be split into different stages. In order to cover the financial risk for the development team, we decide to split the distribution of the bounty into 2 parts. The first part is distributed(on [Subscan](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6)) in November 2021 and rest of KSM is hold in a multi-sig wallet on KSM: FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6. In June 2022, the rest of the bounty is completed, but the remaining KSM in the bounty can't cover the cost because the KSM price drops in 2022.\n\nAs the curator of the bounty, hereby I kindly ask the council to approve the request to top up 1543.17 KSM into the bounty according to the calculation.  \n\n![Time Spent Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/main/res/TimeSpent.png)\n\n## Reviews\n\nFor the detail of the review of bounty 3 please refer to: \n* [Review of Part 1 on 2021 October - Beacon](https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/blob/main/Submission/202110Beacon_Review.md)\n* [Review of Part 1 on 2021 October - Fearless Wallet](https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/blob/main/Submission/202110Fearless_Submission_Review.md)\n* [Review of Part 2 on 2022 June](https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/blob/main/Submission/202206Review.md)\n\n## Bounty Distribution Recap\n\nThe reward of the bounty is paid in two parts due to the size of the work being big which may introduce financial risk to the teams if we only distribute the reward by the completion of the bounty. \n\nThe first part is summarized in: https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/tree/main/Submission and is distributed by the multi-sig account FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6 with 394.328 KSM, the rest KSM reserved for part2 is 694.552 KSM.\n\nThe discussion is followed on [Polkassembly](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/3#75f2df36-575c-4a1e-973d-426fc01542b1)\n![First Part Comment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/main/res/firstPart.png)\n\nThe multi-sig wallet is currently handled by 4 accounts for transparency, two from me, one from Pascal of the Beacon team, and one from Anton of the Fearless/Nova team.\n\nTo be noticed here. Anton was a team member of the Fearless Wallet team and during the development, he switched his role to only the present Nova team due to the reconstruction of the companies. Anton's role in the multi-sig is not changed as he consistently worked for the bounty and provided useful insights for both teams. This is under the agreement of both the Nova and the Fearless Wallet team, and does not introduce any conflict into the reward distribution.\n\n## Refill KSM \n\nDue to the volatility of KSM(The KSM price is 368 USD when we distribute the first part of the bounty, now 61.351 USD), we need to add more KSM into the bounty in order to cover the cost of the second part of the bounty.\n\nAccording to the calculation, we still need 1543.17 KSM.\n\nThe KSM will first send to the multi-sig account FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6, which is also the original beneficiary of bounty #3. and be further distributed to:\n* Beacon team (Paper AG): G4bxLcMawBgsCt3Qj1khSyS1MxorfyHbUXrFyjQ6zySbTrs\n* Nova Foundation: H3cSNjAW86NfTecufGPhxutea8KrEcZdPa4XgVKfhTMugej\n* SORAMITSU(Fearless Wallet): FyLYnuNoMAVkz1VZMMGZFHDPghQQm1916fCon1CqNt2aXbX\n\n### Future Plan\n\nCurrently, the adoption of Beacon Protocol in Polkadot Ecosystem is strongly dependent on the decision if dApps want to integrate Beacon SDK. We find a better way to gain adoption is to integrate the Beacon SDK in the Polkadot.js extension as almost every dApp supports Polkadot.js/extension to connect the wallet. It is also beneficial for dApps because they do not need to extra effort to integrate with Beacon.\n\nSo there is some extra work to do on Polkadot.js/extension, the plan is detailed in the Github issue [here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/issues/989)\n\nThe beacon team will work closely with Polkadot.js/extension team to make this happen, and apply for a new bounty when it is necessary.\n\n### Contact Information\n* Curator: Hanwen Cheng hanwen@litentry.com\n* Beacon Network: Pascal p.brun@papers.ch \n* Nova Wallet: anton@novawallet.io\n* Fearless Wallet: petrov@soramitsu.co.jp\n",

      "title": "Polkadot js plus 1st treasury proposal",
      "content": "**Polkadot js plus extension**, or for short Plus, is Polkadot js extension, plus new features. It is a user-friendly wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains/parachains through a browser. It allows users to access their account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps.\nPlus is based on Polkadot js extension, and gets constantly updated with it. Plus does whatever the original extension does and more.\n\n![PJP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/intro.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe reason why we have decided to work on this project is because every day users comment on social media complaining about the complexity of the original application: \"why the extension does not show the balance?\", \"It is too complicated for new/average users to work with\", \"It is too abstract\", \" why should we go to another web site to work with the extension?\", \" how could contribute to the crowdloans via extension?\", and so on. Hence, we started to work on the Plus extension to address such concerns/requests from the Polkadot community.\n\n**Polkadot js Plus features**\n\nThe following features are currently available in Polkadot js Plus extension:\n\n\n1. View balances (crypto/USD) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#accounts-page))\n2. Transfer funds ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#transfer-funds))\n3. View transaction history ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#transactions-history))\n4. View an address as a QR code ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#qr-code))\n5. **Regular staking** (stake, unstake, rebag, redeem, nominate, view rewards history, etc)  ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#easy-staking))\n6. **Nomination Pools** (join/create pool, stake, unstake, redeem, nominate, manage pool, etc) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#easy-staking))\n7. Supporting different endpoints ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#social-recovery))\n8. Crowdloans (View Auctions/crowdloans/contributions and contribute to crowdloans) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#crowdloans))\n9. **Governance** (vote referendums, endorse proposals, vote/unvote councils, view motions, view/submit treasury proposals and view/submit tips) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#governance))\n10. **Social account recovery** ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#social-recovery))\n\n\n**Problem statement**\n\nPolkadot js Plus team aims to provide additional new features, and the budget is requested for the development of the 1st milestone:\n\nMilestone 1:\n\n- Re-developing of the current features by completely redesigning of the extension‘s UI/UX: Until now, we were mostly focused on bringing new functionalities to the Polkadot js Plus extension, and tried to be consistent with the UI of the Polkadot official extension. Even though we have received positive feedback from the community, we noticed that the community also wants a new design and user experience. Hence, we have decided to completely redesign the extension, to make users feel more comfortable and focus on what's important, by creating a stylized but instantly recognizable UI. In addition, users be able to efficiently and quickly get most of the common functionalities done on Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem blockchains. Furthermore, we rename the extension to “Polkagate”, to be as the gateway to Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n![polkagate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/553705cdf85d222b3e9126a715cc122a2fa5ade3/polkagate/intro.png)\n\n- Nomination pools (Phase 2): Nomination pools as a new feature of the Substrate is currently implemented on Kusama, and Polkadot js Plus is among the first wallets to provide this feature for the community. The nomination pool is a work in progress, where some new features are on the list to be added to the blockchain, and also there are some currently added features like “kicking all members out when pool is destroying” and no UI are currently supporting those features. We want to add the nomination pools new features which is not currently available in the extension, such as facilities around Blocked and Destroying state where: If the pool state is in Blocked, and you are the state_toggler or root role, then you should be able to unbond and withdraw anyone else, and if the pool state is in Destroying, then anyone should be able to unbond and withdraw anyone, except the depositor.\n\n- Proxy accounts support: Proxies are a great feature because they add in a layer of security to the Polkadot ecosystem. Rather than using funds in one sole account, smaller accounts with predefined roles complete tasks for the main account. But using this great feature is difficult for users.\nAs quoted by two councilors below, there is a lot of enthusiasm for using proxies, but almost no support from extensions.\n**Will (Paradox)** on Element: “I would love it if I could add a 'proxy only' account in Polkadot.JS/extension, it would require the public address of the real account and the private keys for a proxy account. Any transactions would be signed by the proxy on behalf of the real”. \n**Bryan Chen** on twitter: “Proxy account is such an underrated feature that can significantly improve account security but we have virtually zero support on this amazing feature. It will be great if we can use this feature without switching browser extensions.”\nWe want to add the support of proxy accounts to the extension so that users can easily create and utilize proxy accounts while minimizing the risk of their main/stash account.\n\n\nMilestone 2:\n\n- Governance 2 (Phase 1): Almost all of the governance features are currently included in the Polkadot js Plus extension, we would like to have Governance 2 features in the extension as well. Community involvement is still low in governance activities like democracy voting. Sometimes proposals are very technical, and sometimes users may not be available in the voting period to vote. Providing vote delegation besides all governance facilities in Polkadot js Plus extension, will increase the tokens participated in different Governance voting activities. \n\n\n- Identity management: Identities exist on-chain but cannot be seen on the extension’s account page, we will bring the Identities into the extension. Accounts’ names in the extension may differ from their on-chain identities, and this may be inconvenient to distinguish which identity belongs to which name/Id. The problem will be more for users with multiple accounts. Moreover, in social recovery, when you lose your account, most probably you cannot remember the address! By integrating the Identity management into the extension, users not only can easily set their identities but also request judgements using the extension. In addition, using the on-chain identity instead of the local name of accounts, makes the accounts management more convenient. Identities also help social recovery be more user-friendly for users. \n\n- Light client integration: We would like to provide the Polkadot light client as an end point in the extension, which will make the extension much more standalone, and help the ecosystem to be more decentralized. If blockchain endpoints stop servicing for whatever reason, since no data can be fetched from them, hence all extensions and wallets would be useless. Integrating the light client inside the extension not only helps to distribute the Polkadot ecosystem more but also lets the extension operate while all existing endpoints stop servicing. However, we need to consider the sync waiting time when using the light client.\n\n**Incorporating community feedback** ([link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1764)):\n\nBased on the comments and the discussion on the Kusama Direction channel, we have modified the proposal as follows:\n\n - we have reduced the redesign section budget by approximately 42% through:\n      -  reusing parts of the codes\n      -  moving 2 of 10 current features/items for re-developement to milestone 2\n\n  - we have replaced the word \"redesign\" with \"re-develop\" which makes more sense\n  - we have moved \"identity management\" from milestone 1 to 2\n  - we have added \"Proxy accounts support\" as a more critical feature to milestone 1\n\nHere you can find the [Revised proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JGzIuiTfNA5KwKisKB6I-NDQeOXnasn). \nThe [previous version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T9l6lw4mgjz9rF_Ckhpr8fTgoxHFJkL) is also available for comparison and transparency.\n\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPolkadot js Plus team",

KILT Protocol, Phala Network, Subsquid, Crust Network, Bifrost, Basilisk and others came together to lay out a week full of Polkadot ecosystem events and educational content.\n\nInstead of organizing a full one- or two-day conference as it has been done for example during EthCC in Paris, the organizer team decided to approach it in a different way and make use of the full seven days of Berlin Blockchain Week.\n\nThe goal is to organize every day a Polkadot specific event based on a different ecosystem topic (Cloud services, UI/UX in DeFi, NFT & metaverse infra, Polkadot updates). Every event is organized in a different style (from boat party to panel discussion and NFT art gallery event) to show the diversity of our ecosystem and use every day of the blockchain week to promote the Polkadot brand.\nEvents will be live streamed and published on Polkadots official crowdcast. All events are communicated with the official Berlin Blockchain Week events organization TG channel and will be also published on the official events calendar.\n\n**Note regarding beneficiary address:**\n\nDue to the fact that the individuals representing different parachains submitting this proposal are unable to off-ramp the KSM to pay the cost of the event. The Parity Finance will assist by helping off-ramp the KSM and pay for cost of the events. None of the funds will go to Parity directly.\n\nPlease see the full proposal here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNnZesUGUTBpr4k9fHLbr61J8qSWppc1/edit\n\nblockchainweek.berlin (https://blockchainweek.berlin/)",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nWe're proud to present our very first proposal from the Sublab team which primary focus is on developing tools for developers in Substrate ecosystem.\n\nPlease feel free to read the full proposal document at this link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvQw2bf2uH3qEJR2594Hj5FtmsxbcaKoodZYyKwJkx4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvQw2bf2uH3qEJR2594Hj5FtmsxbcaKoodZYyKwJkx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://sublab.dev/logo.png)\n\n**Context of proposal**\n\n[sublab.dev](sublab.dev) is the company designated to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community. \n\nWe’re a team of 3 engineers at this moment, consisting of 1 Senior iOS Engineer; 1 Support Engineer; and former [Fearless Wallet](http://fearlesswallet.io) Technical Lead, proficient in both iOS and Android development since 2010, who led Mobile Departments in several companies, including his own, and knows everything about mobile apps architecture. Our goal is to reach the current state of ecosystem needs in our libraries as soon as possible, starting with a few people to build a strong and reliable foundation to be used further to develop as many APIs and different chain clients as possible. Last, but not least, we want to provide technical support in our Telegram chat for developers having questions about integration to their mobile apps.\n\nRight now, we would love to start with the development of SCALE codec as this is the one of the basic dependencies to do anything in the ecosystem. As stated in [Substrate Docs](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/scale-codec/#implementations) there are no existing ready-to-use libraries for this purpose in Swift or Kotlin. Even though such implementations already exist in a couple of live mobile wallets, it’s not covered with documentation, has outdated unit-tests, and strongly tied to existing libraries codebase which are very specific for wallets needs. And then finalize the current milestone with basic Substrate client implementation.\n\n**What we're trying to accomplish within this milestone**\n\nRight now there are only a few mobile apps in the ecosystem, and almost no ready-to-use tools for new players in the market. Existing apps share their source code, but it would take huge efforts and a big amount of time for even very strong developers to dive into the ecosystem development, because if they’re not familiar with the ecosystem philosophy and technical aspects, they will definitely need to learn from the beginning. So, basically speaking, only the strongest developers could easily (or not so) step into the development inside the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. \n\nThus, as we see it, to make it possible for the ecosystem to grow more and attract more mobile developers to it, there is a need for strong, reliable, open-source, well documented libraries to kickstart more innovative projects. **With the tool set of easy-to-use transparent libraries, we believe that the entry threshold into the ecosystem will fall down and will let even more developers start working with it.**\n\nExisting SCALE codec implementations for mobile platforms do not provide any documentation, have outdated unit-tests, have a redundant interlayer of JSON key-based serialization which is a specific requirement for their app needs, though not follow pure SCALE responsibility and designation. \n\nAt the very beginning, we want to solve this problem by making fully native open-source libraries which give both options to end developers: \n\n- Work with SCALE codec as it was designed\n- Work with SCALE codec by slight transformation with interlayer between\n\nOn top of it, we’re planning to build **Substrate client libraries**, which by using the SCALE toolset will cover basic messaging with any potential Substrate-based network. At this stage, we would like to exclude the signature routine from this library, because this requires more time to make architectural solutions regarding support of different signature methods and how to properly inject them depending on various chains already out there. However an existing set of signatures in the ecosystem by the date of publication will be supported within this milestone.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nWe want the Substrate ecosystem developers to just do brand new features to make the ecosystem richer and be recognizable by even more people around the globe, while we can hold their backs by doing a great infrastructural work. We want to see more mobile apps in the ecosystem either from existing parachains to launch their own apps or absolutely new mobile wallets with more innovative functions. Same we want to help existing applications by solving their core issues within our works and help them adopt our products. Also we aim to partner with as much as possible existing networks and/or companies who already deliver their services to ecosystem, so that even their products might be easy accessible via reliable SDKs.\n\n**Proposal financing and deliverables**\n\nWe're requesting $81,900 for the current milestone which includes both SCALE codec implementation and Substrate client library implementation. Both parts are planned to be released separately and sequentially along with publications to public package managers' repositories, as well as on our GitHub for a review. Also we're planning announcements on our Telegram channel and future Medium blog with a brief description of deliverables. And in the end when we finish documentation part we're going to publish on-chain report with appropriate links to the open source code, package managers' repositories, our articles on Medium, and links to documentation website.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you any constructive feedback and/or questions regarding our planned works. Feel free to refer to our [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvQw2bf2uH3qEJR2594Hj5FtmsxbcaKoodZYyKwJkx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSincerely,\nSublab team",

      "content": "Including the contextual information of [the bounty proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/14) below:\n__________________________________________________________\n\n\"Dear community,\n\nI am proposing the creation of a bounty for funding an incentive for the moderation team. We have opened discussions on [our proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1644) for two months and have received no community objection.\n\nSummary Reddit, Discord, and Element are three Social Media platforms that Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem use to communicate and educate older and newer users alike as well as builders, content creators, and even those who fund projects. Social media can be quite a hectic place to have discussion, with everyone being able to put their opinion out there.\n\nThese avenues also open up new ways to scam users or commit fraud. This is where the moderation team comes in. The moderation team acts as a first line of defense against scams for all the platforms and ensure conversations stay on topic as well as stay respectful and follow the rules. Moderators not only act as a defense against hostile actors, but they act as educators as well.\n\nFor most users on the server, the moderators were the first people in the ecosystem to give guidance on finding out more information regarding Polkadot/Kusama. This bounty aims to reward those moderators and perhaps future moderators for ensuring the safety of the server as well as educating users. It is not meant to act as income, but as a token of appreciation for the hard work that goes into moderating.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the proposal, which can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17bjVgOOprGsz8DGn6D6_thEQyNZRaMSYZbDpsTOud2w/edit#heading=h.kl7lv0cg56u1).\"",

      "content": "Overview\n--------\n\n**The Sovereign Nature Initiative**\n\n[Sovereign Nature Initiative](https://sovereignnature.com/) (SNI) is a non-profit foundation that has brought together multiple partners and engineers from the Kusama ecosystem including [Kodadot](https://nft.kodadot.xyz/), [Unique Network](https://unique.network), [Kilt Protocol](https://kilt.io), [Momentum](https://odyssey.org/explore-momentum), and [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), to support the building of Web3 capacities for wildlife conservancies and other NGOs working on restoring and protecting biodiverse ecosystems.\n\nSNI's KWT Hackathon is an online event for crowdsourcing solutions for wild-life identification with computer-vision techniques and onboarding these identities on web3 data and ssi protocols, as well as presenting these identities in different ways in the metaverse. This effort has a major impact on conservation, which currently disposes of manual techniques, taking up to 6 months to process, resulting in siloed physical profiles.\n\n**Venue:** Odyssey Momentum online Hackathon space: sni.odyssey.org\n\n**Hackathon Dates:** October the  7th until November the 6th\n\n**Winners Announcement:** Tuesday the 7th of November\n\nCandidates should apply before the 12th of September 2022 by completing [this form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd22MYldgFgyxj0HX5CaIq7CIAgzs8y_6gDhnM4gaupipMrjw/viewform?usp=sf_link) \n\nWe will let applicants know if they are invited or not by the 16th of September 2022. \n\n**Beneficiary address:**\nG2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\n**Submitter address:**\nG2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\nCommunity Spend & Deliverables\n------------------------------\n\nThe pledges we are seeking from the Council will provide prizes to enhance the reach and impact of these project -- 320 KSM in prizes for the winners of the contests, which will encourage them to continue building their DApps to full fruition after the Hackathon for the benefit of KWT and other conservancies around the world dealing with similar challenges (see description below).\n\n### Amount to spend from the community pool\n\n**Total Ask: 320 KSM**\n\n**Distribution:**\n\n-   80 KSM to the first 2 Winners (1 winner per challenge)\n\n-   48 KSM to the first 2 Runners-up (1 runners-up per challenge)\n\n-   60 KSM to be equally divided amongst the remaining teams\n\nThe Jury will be composed of representatives of KWT, SNI, and 2 experts from the field of technology and conservation. The Jury will select 4 winners to which it will distribute such an amount. In its decision, the Jury will be looking for novelty, ease of implementation with existing technologies, the degree of impact and efficiency the solution brings to the conservancies' operations, and other relevant factors such as cost of implementation etc.\n\nIntroduction to the KWT Hackathon, the Challenges & Ecosystem Growth opportunities\n\nThe Web3 for nature restoration and conservation space is growing exponentially, with Hackathons, grants, and investments flooding into this emerging ecosystem. The aim of this Web3 movement is to bring forward the development of tools and token economic models that could support NGOs and other wildlife conservation organizations to find alternative solutions to finance and manage their vital work of protecting and restoring wildlife ecosystems.\n\nThis space, loosely defined often as ReFi, Regen Community, or Web3 for Nature is currently led by Ethereum, Polygon, and by the work of Regen.Network which is part of the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nSovereign Nature Initiative is recognized as a leading node in such an ecosystem and together with strategic partners such as Kilt Protocol, KodaDOT, Bitgreen, Momentum, and Unique.Network is trying to advocate for the use of the Kusama ecosystem as the \"go-to\" chain for environmental projects due to its recognized lowest carbon footprint in the market, and its federated framework for governance and decision-making, which are vital features for conservancies and other land stewards. \n\nTo foster innovation in the ecosystem that is both beneficial for the network and builds capacity for nature stewards working in the field, SNI hosts online Hackathons and [Incubators](https://sovereignnature.com/programs/germinators-program) in partnership with conservancies globally.\n\nBuilding on the success of our latest [competition](https://sovereignnature.com/winter-2022-hackathon-challenge) supported by the [Treasury](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/425), and our recent [May 2022 Experimental Zone](https://sovereignnature.com/tpost/52pojp8lo1-reflections-on-experimental-zone-1) in Amsterdam, in October-November this year we will again be inviting the most talented Web3 teams from around the world to build tech in service to the health and balance of life on our planet.\n\nIn this iteration, we are partnering with the [Kenya Wildlife Trust](https://www.kenyawildlifetrust.org/) (KWT), an NGO committed to the protection and conservation of predators and their ecology, situated in the Maasai Mara National park in southwestern Kenya.\n\nKWT, aware of the potential of emerging decentralized technologies, has identified two specific problems they invite teams to tackle:\n\n-   The identification of lions through computer vision models\n\n-   Predators and farmers' conflict management through spatio-temporal prediction modeling and other conflict mitigation approaches\n\nImproving the lions' Identification process and ID management\n\nA significant portion of KWT's resources is spent on the identification of predators in the Maasai Mara ecosystem. These identifications allow staff to monitor the population and  create model-density estimates and distribution trends, data which are essential for conservation. Due to their physical characteristics, individual lions are more challenging to identify than other predators and the images are painstakingly screened and processed by three employees.\n\nThis challenge is a fantastic opportunity to develop the capabilities of protocols and teams working on verifiable credentials such as our partners at Kilt Protocol.\n\n### Predators and farmers' conflict mitigation\n\nThe survival of predators in a mixed-use landscape like the Maasai Mara depends upon the goodwill of people to coexist with other non-human and undomesticated life. In the Maasai Mara ecosystem, farmers and wildlife live in close proximity, and predators often prey on cattle. Successful measures have been taken to build better protection and deterrent mechanisms. Still, KWT knows that more can be done to create truly resilient means to support cohabitation, which considers both the socio-economical context and the everyday life of farmers' communities. We, therefore, invite teams to harness their creativity, skills, and expertise toward building tools that can serve as facilitators of a new symbiotic relationship between human communities and predators.\n\nIdeas might include, but should not be limited to, providing the technological and economic tools for communities to safely cohabit with predators, and creating the conditions for farmers to understand the importance of predators, and participate in the value predators generate by regulating the complex dynamics of the savanna ecosystem.\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity for protocols and teams working on data markets and IoT to validate and expand the use cases of their technology. For example, machine learning can be done using Ocean Protocol Compute-To-Data service which will allow us to hide lion tracking data from the public while opening it to data processing and prediction modeling.\n\n### Target Group\n\nIdeal participants are labs, startups, collectives, or companies with a heart for conservation, an ambition to build life-sustaining systems, and who are well versed in some or all of the following technology stack:\n\n-   Web3 - wildlife and biodiversity data oracles.\n\n-   Token Engineering - crypto native models for conservancies funds distribution.\n\n-   Spatio-temporal prediction modeling - wildlife mobility predictions and human-wildlife conflict mitigation.\n\n-   Citizen Science - applications for wildlife tracking and identification.\n\n-   Computer Vision models for wild animals recognition, identification, and tracking.\n\nPrevious experience working on similar conservation projects is desired but not required.\n\n**Maximum Team Size: 8 members**\n\nOur intention is to have at least half of the participants based in the African continent. We foresee this being an excellent opportunity for Kusama to grow its ecosystem in the East-African region, which is currently dominated by other protocols and their respective supporting communities.\n\n**Open Source**\n\nNature doesn't care about ownership. In the spirit of open collaboration, all software developed during the Hackathon should be licensed under Open Source license.",

Ideally, to receive the fund as soon as possible. \n\n> The deadline for knowing whether or not the Council approves this initiative is August 19, after which there will be no conditions for its execution in time. \n\nOnce this proposal is approved, we will start our initial expenses with liquidity provided by Francisco Carvalho (organizer of Blockchain Rio) and as soon as the resources are available we will have to carry out this reimbursement.\n\n**Requested KSM:**\n$244,043.80 USD (3,998.75 KSMs)\n\n**KSM Value:**\n$61,03 USD (calculated by the 7 day average rate on 13/08/2022)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/vmbNRCN/Captura-de-Tela-2022-07-14-a-s-04-54-34.png) \n\n> The citation of People, Institutions and Projects in this proposal is for DOCUMENTARY nature only and DOES NOT MEAN any kind of ADHESION, PREVIOUS SUPPORT or that the ideas presented here ARE NOT SUBJECT TO QUESTIONS. This is an inclusive Proposal. Our production will be open to anyone who wants to expose their projects and ideas, whether they are Ambassadors or Representatives of Parachains, Dapps and Teams. Just get in touch by email: contato@polkadot.com.br. \n\nThis proposal is the result of two months of intense discussions involving its developers and also a lot of feedback that came from members of Parity, WEB3 Foundation, the Council, the Ambassador Program, Parachains and DAPPs, journalists, local audiences, as well many specialist professionals in working within the ecosystem.\n\n> The first challenge after so much feedback is reconciling so many different views and expectations. It is simply not possible to please everyone. And between so many extremes we decided to follow a path that remains viable and that we believe will be the one that will give the best results.\n\n[Blockchain Rio](https://www.blockchainrio.com.br/) ([https://www.blockchainrio.com.br/](https://www.blockchainrio.com.br/)) is a very rare opportunity in Brazil. To establish ties with corporate, institutional and government decision-makers. And also to make contact with students (college, university and even postgraduates), developers and creative professionals. All of it is in a country of continental size marked by a festive culture and which is open to understanding and applying our knowledge.\n\nSo far, there is no other event in Brazil or even LATAM that has managed to gather so many guests (more than 250) that represents multiple sectors interested in this market, promoting a cross dialogue between them. And our planning captures this concept very well, making DOTSAMA appropriate this narrative about the future of WEB3.\n\n**LATAM Let's Grow with DOTSAMA!**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/B3x2jKh/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-51-41.png)\n**Full Proposal (FINAL VERSION)**\n-[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUZLS1EBICh9yzUDC5ayw31lsYvOqUW_t2Vcn8I_YaE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUZLS1EBICh9yzUDC5ayw31lsYvOqUW_t2Vcn8I_YaE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Pré-Proposal for Discussion**\n- [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1742](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1742)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0Cxt0pz/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-51-21.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/T1CGQw9/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-51-04.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/VLLLh7f/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-50-43.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/YjDhxjn/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-50-23.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/ws5bk7H/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-49-57.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/WHdFwsj/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-49-39.png)\n\n\n\n**The Proponent of this Project is a Multisign formed by:**\n\n**Francisco Carvalho** - Founder and Ceo of Vision Realty (Real State) and Blockchain Rio. Specialist in Blockchain at MIT, he is also an Advisory Board Member in Venture Capital: Crypto Valey Associate.\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-carvalho-706b2bb5/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-carvalho-706b2bb5/)\n\n**Eduardo Cardoso (ECARDO5O)** - Creative and Project Director since 1998, elected member of the GLMR APES DAO's Council (the top 1 NFT collection on Moonbeam Network). He has been working as a Communication Consultant and Product Planner in the Traditional Financial Market for over 20 years, accumulating awards in Brazil and abroad. Regularly contributed to the development of the ecosystem as a Speaker, Editor (polkadot.com.br) and also as one of the Creative Directors at the Kappa Sigma Mu Society Brand Project. On Youtube, he collaborates on the Polkadot Brasil, Polkadot Spanish and PolkaCortes channels and has had 2 award-winning pieces in animation (for Astar and Parallel) in the Polkadot Year-End Contest (2021 edition).\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-cardoso-perfil/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-cardoso-perfil/)\n\n**Tiago Lucer** - Systems architect, Educator, Project analyst and one of the founders of the DOTSAMA Community in Brazil. He will give the final approval on the financial outflows of this wallet and will act as an observer of the Community regarding the applicability of the funds to fulfill the objectives of this Proposal.\n\n> This Proposal was only possible because of the constant, fast and accurate support of the Organizers of Blockchain Rio, Hacking Rio, Rio Crypto Hub, Brasil NFT and Código Brazuca (Educational Program responsible for the first two permanent nodes for Kusama and Polkadot in Rio). All these collectives form the core of the main initiatives involving WEB3 in the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/WPkXdBt/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-49-00.png)",

With the rollout of XCMv3 and additional features like asset locking over XCM, future chains dedicated to subsystems like staking and governance will rely on Statemine to lock KSM for use in other parachains.\n\nWhile this two-year lease is longer than leases available on auction, it is meant to represent Statemine becoming an extension to the Kusama protocol itself.\n\nReleases are published in the [Cumulus repo](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases).\n\nIf people agree that this proposal as configured is worth a vote, then we will put it to public referendum.\n\nHash: `0x4272f0f5d52548e488339bf52861af98904a7f7509b5a067c1ba713b4af813e8`\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/gWw1yHT/Screenshot-2022-08-10-at-08-41-13.png)",

The payment involved in this proposal does not include any software development, human resources, etc. \n\nPreviously, every infrastructure cost of Subscan was applied by submitting treasury proposals separately. The application time was asynchronous and the process was complicated, which is easy to cause some confusion to users, and it is inconvenient to clearly obtain the monthly cost. Therefore , this application will count all unpaid infrastructure costs of the polkadot network before June 30, 2022, including:\n\n- GCP: January 1st - June 30th\n- Datadog: January 1st - June 30th\n- Cloudflare: April 15th - June 30th\n\nIn the future, the billing time of all bills will be completely unified, which is more convenient for community management and supervision.\n\nThis time, we plan to apply for **13,091 USD in Kusama**, the amount of KSM will be converted based on the **EMA7 price** on the day of the official submission.  \n\n- 2022-07-27 10:59:00 (+UTC), Block #13743315\n- KSM EMA7 Price ( USD ): 60.151;\n- Number of KSM: 217.632\n>https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=13091&type=time&from=USD&to=KSM&time=1658919600\n\n**Billing details can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXSELzfmNH1CP9JbI5Nq1wu8H83vnxJJ22TEjkF2Wgg/edit?usp=sharing).**",

More are on the way!\n\nIn **Q3 & 4 **we are requesting to spend the same rates for content production with a slightly reduced output adjusted to market sentiment. We're also reintroducing a Tutorial show for when attention returns to the ecosystem as well as mastering our catalogue of [60+ interviews](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtyd7v_I7PGkq7KUe3ep3lFLgKG97Z2AO) for distribution on popular podcast platforms. For each quarter we are requesting to spend aprox. 14% less than **Q2**\n\nWe are, however, for the first time additionally proposing to spend 14% of the requested **8002.8 KSM** on further developing **WagMedia** which endeavours to handle all content-focused tip and spending proposals previously put at the foot of the council. Goals over the next 2 quarters include, expanding our peer-reviewed translation and non-anglo community units, opening our Marketing department, and further decentralizing award distribution with the development of our bot, **The Concierge**. A proposal to top up **Bounty #12** to handle the Spend Proposal and Translation features (not part of the original curatorship) will follow [shortly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZA2kmLxJyFbF5Xwa7dxdrK6b6F8Z8UbUiMoU-lBoMRQ/edit#).\n\nFor now please dive into T[he Kusamarian 6 Month Maintenance Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_C34F07_LgY6DLgiXiLxbkMY_YH53if6esNhxXXYDG4/edit?usp=sharing) where you can meet our team, see what they propose to spend, and what they'll continue to build.\n\nThank you for supporting **Chrawnna Corp.** from a small tutorial youtube channel to what is today. We work every day to create top quality content in line with Token Holder interests with **The Kusamarian**. And with **WagMedia** we put the treasury to work by connecting it to eager content creators Decentralizing the Story of Dotsama within a productive and supportive community.\n\nYour comments, questions, and constructive suggestions are most welcome.",

      "content": "Encointer seeks for financing of its planned activities for the remaining time of its current common-good parachain lease, split into two proposals. The current proposal shall cover the funding until the end of September 2022. \n\nThe amount of the proposed treasury spend is **CHF 340’000 = USD 350'892 = KSM 6271.63**.\n*using [EMA50](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) and today's bid price for CHF*\n\nEncointer has onboarded as a common good parachain on Kusama on Jan 9th 2022. In May 2022, a first real community in Zurich was launched and has steadily grown to 130 users within 40 days doing almost 800 transactions in community currency. More communities are in preparation currently\n\nThe main focus of Encointer is currently:\n\n* to grow its Zurich community in order to prove the viability of its protocol and implementation as well as its economics with a pioneer community.\n* to onboard new communities around the world, especially in less developed regions in order to follow its vision.\n* to integrate with other parachains in the DotSama ecosystem for sybil-defense and one-person-one-vote democracy.\n\nSo far, Encointer was able to finance its past activities mostly thanks to the appreciation of the DOT and KSM tokens it received as web3 or DOT/KSM treasury grants. The association was also able to collect private donations and significant amounts of work were provided pro bono. Encointer’s financial strategy has been to keep around 70% of its capital in DOT and KSM which proved to be a good strategy so far, as our detailed numbers will show below. Due to recent market corrections, however, the runway of Encointer has dramatically decreased and Encointer can currently only maintain its current activity (development, operation, marketing, community building) for ~2 more months.  As a common-good, Encointer has no way to promise any return on investment, so the project relies on grants and donations.\n\nSee our [Proposal with full details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTyZGCTCzo7ZGonVtAmJmc5QYYI0qYHab6z8w56B_F0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n",

      "content": "**This proposal was added through BrightTreasury. For more info & discussion, check [BrightTreasury](https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/179?networkId=kusama)**\n\n## About the project\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to fund development of further integration of BrightTreasury with Polkassembly. It would cover sharing the proposal Ideas to Polkassembly as a discussion as well as cross-posting of comments added via BrightTreasury & Polkassembly. This way any discussion about potential proposals could be held between users using their app of preference. As we focus on users who are less fluent in the Polkadot governance and community customs, it would allow them to gather feedback from more advanced users, who might be more inclined to use Polkassembly.\n\nProject Link : https://treasury.bright.dev\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\n## Milestones\n\n* Ideas Polkassembly integration\n* Comments Polkassembly integration\n* \"Likes\" in BrightTreasury + UX Improvements\n\n[See more...](https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/179/milestones?networkId=kusama)",

      "content": "This is a treasury proposal whose proposer address (FyLYnuNoMAVkz1VZMMGZFHDPghQQm1916fCon1CqNt2aXbX) is shown in on-chain info below.\n\n**Fearless Wallet Proposal**: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex7ew2P7w2nUQ_ZECoeGlsCMORGOR6YdwD5YP1JS__0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex7ew2P7w2nUQ_ZECoeGlsCMORGOR6YdwD5YP1JS__0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/9FMfrj9P/Proposal-background.jpg)\n\n**Context of the proposal**\n\n[Fearless Wallet ](https://fearlesswallet.io/)is:\n\n- A native **open source mobile app** for [iOS/](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/fearless-wallet/id1537251089?l=en)[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.soramitsu.fearless) \n- A native **open source library** for Substrate [iOS](https://github.com/soramitsu/fearless-utils-iOS)/[Android](https://github.com/soramitsu/fearless-utils-Android)\n- **Non-custodial** and **decentralized**, communicating directly with blockchain nodes\n- An app with **superior UX/UI, performance and security**\n- Used by **130 000+ people around the world** (based on AppStore and Google Play data)\n- **50 000+ active users (MAU)** based on recent App Markets data \n- **An important source of traffic, with 1 mln+** daily requests to Kusama and Polkadot, and other parachains (based on OnFinality nodes)\n- **Fully funded and supported by** [Kusama Treasury](https://kusama.network/), developed by [SORAMITSU](https://soramitsu.co.jp/)\n\n\n**This proposal focuses** on the implementation of:\n\n- **A UI/UX update of the main Wallet screens and flows**: The wallet’s current version could struggle to keep up with the breakneck pace of recent and upcoming initiatives and innovations of the ecosystem. The new wallet design will solve this set of issues and challenges, such as supporting multiple assets from hundreds of parachains, along with the possibility to exchange tokens between networks, work with NFTs and perform swaps within the wallet interface. \n- **NFT integration (Stage 1)**: Non-fungible token support is a feature that has  great community demand. In terms of the Stage #1 we’re going to implement some basic flows such as integrating a list of NFTs and Collections, along with NFT details and transfers. This implementation will be made for Statemine and Kusama (RMRK) NFT. In the future other NFT products of the Ecosystem can be supported through other proposals.\n- **Democracy feature integration (Stage 1)**: Democracy and governance systems are an important Dotsama advantage. The most valuable and demanded Democracy functions are Referenda flows and the ability to submit Proposals and vote for them. Stage #1 of integration will address these functions, and will also provide off-chain integration with Polkassembly and Subsquare platforms, to give users an opportunity to participate in an initiative’s preliminary discussions on the Polkassembly platform. All proposed integrations will be compatible with the upcoming Governance v2.0 update.\n- **XCM cross-chain teleports support**: Interoperability is one of the Dotsama ecosystem’s main benefits. The XCM message format allows assets to be moved between relay chains and parachains (and vice versa), as well as between various parachains. It provides the Ecosystem amazing flexibility, liquidity mobility, and high performance. As a part of this proposal we are going to implement XCM teleports between relay chains (Polkadot/Kusama) and parachains.\n- **Staking update on Polkadot/Kusama. Nomination pools.** Staking is a crucial functionality on blockchains that have PoS(DPoS/NPoS) consensus algorithms. In fact, community members are eager to make their contribution to system stability, safety, and decentralization by staking their assets. Nomination pools functionality is a cutting edge update of the staking function set. Therefore, our team has decided to add it to the scope of work, and is certain this innovative development will become a new trend in the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n- **dApp connector/signer**. The feature will work together with the Fearless Web extension application. The Web extension app has the role of a middleware service that provides some logic and necessary APIs to communicate between Mobile clients (Fearless Wallet Android/iOS Apps) and the Polkadot JS Extension protocol. It will allow users to: \n\n1.  Establish and maintain a connection with a dApp\n2.  Verify dApp generated transactions via the Mobile App without the need to export their user accounts to Web browsers\n\n\n**Submission details**\n\nAll details are available in the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex7ew2P7w2nUQ_ZECoeGlsCMORGOR6YdwD5YP1JS__0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n**The amount requested for the first submission is  $ 318 500.**\n\nThe amount will be recalculated according to the 7 day average rate, using the high and low of the week on Coingecko, at the day of on-chain action after the discussion process ends.\n\n\n**The 1st milestone  includes:**\n\n- New Wallet UI/UX \n- Nomination pools \n- Half of infrastructural costs\n\n\n**Previous grant completion report and final demo**\n\n- [Link to the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NMYMsKBDFiRGWB5I05v8aNrM3pq6qKrXQcfhhs4guR4/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Demo #8, April 12th, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzEUkUWFo)\n\n",

      "content": "## Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable data indexing infrastructure for most of the DotSama ecosystem (and growing).\n\nArchives are an important piece of DotSama data infrastructure provided by Subsquid. They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains added as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\nAll archives can be accessed and queried via an web intuitive GraphiQL interface and are often used as developer friendly replacement of a block explorer.\n\nOver the last 3 months (March, April, May 2022) we've provided a free public data indexing service for ~35 Substrate blockchains (some archives have been dismissed, new ones have been added), so that everyone interested in the projects can publicly access indexed data on Substrate Events, Extrinsics, Storage Items and EVM logs.\n\nBetween 2022-03-20 (when tracking has started) and 2022-05-06 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n\n- Served a total of 1,213,705,478 (1.2 billion) queries\n- The highest daily total was 394,214,930 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our 7 day average at the end of this period is over 25 million responses each day.\n- Kusama and Polkadot chains represent a very important share of the demanded data, with 10 and 2.8 million queries per week, respectively\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTM5hIviY0x_1YVeOD0QEw8uPvPHmFKNcAQrEwCQGSF7JuYAZuUCYo9dXrIfRnCQqVVH5tIMzCb1jjC/pubchart?oid=1449674255&format=image)\n\nThis proposal includes the combined costs for running Archives for Kusama and its Parachains, which amounts to a total of  USD $9,771.07 - [raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RkNQ6-10u_nmmNy2Nkwi-i9EDXv6VwwLJw4DdJVx1pQ/).\n\n[Full text of the proposal can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRtyrXYpKdTbv0TcKuqSO_LR2OU4KiqWjUsHaRftNtu7KtpGP1_Q6gXbGzZupPRQhfnD2z5UuhCIOmv/pub)\n\nThank you for your consideration, Subsquid.io\n\n[Website](https://subsquid.io/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/subsquid) [Email](mailto:social@subsquid.io) [Github](https://github.com/subsquid/)",

The following proposed child bounties contain mainly the recurring tasks for block explorers, governance forums and applications, snapshots and validators service providers, open-source and community wallet services, and other projects aiming to cover maintenance costs with treasury funds.\n\nFurther information on the bounty mechanism, management of the funds and budget can be found in [the bounty proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MPyabjOmkiIq4QW6UzIzJUyEzoaVOe2TgUSSQ0r2DxI/edit).",

Also part of this equation is the development of human bonds and a social and cultural awareness of the impacts that WEB3 will have on all of us. In order to pierce this bubble that makes these topics and discussions so far from the reality of most people, the DOTSAMA Adventures project was created. \n\nThrough its actions, meetings and seminars (all held so far only in Latin America) DOTSAMA Adventures has been bringing the academic community, investors, entrepreneurs, students and even people who have heard about cryptos but in fact still don't know what it is about.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NZ5V1Jh/Flyer-Among-the-Stars.png)\n\nDOTSAMA Adventures is a collaborative initiative between members of the ecosystem passionate about decentralised technologies, the same that made the caravan that toured Chile - Among the Stars, inspired by the first activation movements promoted in Latin America, which were the Lima Latam Day.  The final event of this tour was broadcasted on the Polkadot en Español channel (YouTube): https://youtu.be/0qW2z_zpNF0\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mbWxQ8p/Fotos-Among-the-Stars.png)\n\nAll this continuous work in the transmission of knowledge, coexistence and integration has had a great impact on our ecosystem in Latin America, bringing new stakeholders and promoting strategic links and joint action in several countries, something that had not happened until then. Today, this  initiatives involve Ambassadors in Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Colombia and the objective now is to strengthen these ties in the European Continent as well.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/txVPwdM/Barcelona.png)\n\nFor this, the Group created the Spain Activation project, which will consist of the first official and face-to-face meetings of these members of the DOTSAMA community in Latin America with their peers in Europe, in addition to a program that will also involve different sectors of Spanish society - from technology, to sports professionals, through art, science, education and gastronomy.\n\nOur objective in all these actions will be one: to democratize knowledge about the benefits of a Web3, positioning the DOTSAMA ecosystem (including its Parachains) as the main protagonists in this journey.\n\n**DOTSAMA Adventures -  Spain Activation Proposal**:[ Proposal Spain Deploy Chaos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165atRa67b4ioXmIShDMYAcXAyQKaGDATG9QYlG9tOB0/edit)\n\n**Dotsama Adventures- Brief: Brief Deploy Chaos Spain** -[ DOTSAMA ADVENTURE.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uqClTQNhbCIqtsQDnN9UeDV6vYLiXCA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n",

      "content": "As you might remember, [referendum 193](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/193) aiming to make RMRK token sufficient was discussed, submitted and approved by the community. However, the call did not execute succesfully and RMRK token failed to be defined as sufficient on Statemine: the message didn't have root origin, it had `Xcm` origin.\n\nThe RMRK sufficiency proposal was passed via referendum, giving it the most powerful `Root` origin at dispatch. But within the proposal was a message to Statemine with an `Xcm` origin, normally used to express things like \"majority of Council\" as an XCM Multilocation.\n\nThe privileged Assets origin on Statemine expects:\n\n`EnsureOneOf<EnsureRoot<AccountId>, EnsureXcm<IsMajorityOfBody<KsmLocation, ExecutiveBody>>>`\n\nAs in, the origin should either be \"Root\" or \"The majority of the executive body (Council) on Kusama)\". The USDT proposal used Superuser (a.k.a. Root), so it passed the `EnsureRoot` check. The RMRK one, however, had downgraded Root to Xcm, so when the message arrived, it went down the `EnsureXcm` route, to which the filter said, \"that's not the majority of the Council,\" causing it to reject the origin.\n\nThis proposal, a sole council motion, ensures the majority of Council to enact the proposal in the right way, since the same proposal was already approved by the community. \n\nPlease review and vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "This proposal aims to cover organizational costs, curation and setup of the \"Polkadot World\" event on June 17, 18, 19, 2022, in Barcelona (Spain).\n\nPolkadot World aims to be the first three-day face-to-face event aimed both at the Spanish community of Polkadot and Kusama Networks and to all of those who want to join the ecosystem. During those days, the community will be able to enjoy an introduction to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, explanations, workshops and talks on different hot topics of the ecosystem: all accompanied by catering, live music and special guests. The objective of creating the event is to unite the entire Polkadot and Kusama communities, mobilize the Spanish community and establish ties between the community members.\n\nAs a team, we celebrate this event in order to create a space in which to provide attendees with all the necessary information and support in an understandable way for them and motivate the community to be active members of the ecosystem. Our goal is to continue organizing dynamics like this to spread the ethos of the ecosystem throughout Spain and throughout the world.\n\nCheck the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zU1YYvXHt2jESUBDIkFYVN9Bp17_FViSRlhZXY9pu38/edit).\n\nOriginal post discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1522).\n\nFurther community feedback may be found on this discussion [post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1445) and on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/polkadot_world/status/1524037750147665922)\n\n[Brief Polkadot World Barcelona](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VOU4ZD3gMkjlvJCt-THtqtJXJvjA8INM/view?usp=sharing)\n\nI encourage you to leave your comment below.",

Network growth diminishes stakeholder ability to make informed, productive decisions.\n2. Few and privately funded Media outlets distort network narrative.\n\n\n**Solution**:\n\nDecentralize the Story of Dotsama.\n\n\n**How**:\n- Efficient distribution of Treasury Bounty to Researchers & Content creators via Incentivized Discord.\n- Custom bot allows dedicated Content Directors to incentivize with custom \"value emojis\"\n- Participants are paid out weekly to share sourced information or turn it into original content.\n- All are welcome. Completely transparent.\n- Public Dashboard for all stakeholders to see bounties awarded in real time.\n- Multiple project treasuries can incentivize a common pool of research and content talent.\n\n**PoW**:\n- Trial phase Jan 10 - April 10\n- 11 participating treasuries.\n- 495 unique pieces of content\n- Several participants have since become full or part-time builders. 🥳\n- Much more info in the complete Proposal **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9Bo8fH408BV5t2ODvindl4S0W2BfbtDxrwAl9j71k0/edit#)**.\n\nWe would love your questions, feedback, and suggestions.\n\nSee [WagMedia](https://treasury.bright.dev/bounties/discord.gg/YUXqjVXWtp) for yourself!\n\nThank you. 🙂",

This submission covers costs for April, May and June of 2022. We are requesting the Kusama treasury to provide funds this time. We are using a 7 days EMA due to sharp price fall of KSM.\n\nThe full proposal is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1Z71GQ8HyovvUAcdlId3_H8hMqRxdS4rz6z3u30evQ/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": ".Hello Council Team:\n\n1KVnode is a team in North America focusing on the validators ecosystem recently. We find that providing a decentralized infrastructure for the community is important and key to their recovery in a degraded situation. Having multiple mirror copies of snapshots will assist the community to increase their ability to handle the recovery time.\n\nWe are expecting to provide snapshot services in Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend. Nevertheless, we feel that Westend, while being a test-net, it plays a role in many alpha developments of various applications.\n\nWe want to help the community by providing additional instructions for new validators in several languages (English, French, Chinese, Spanish). They will be posted on various social medias. In the meanwhile, we are also looking to decentralize the snapshots service to more service providers out there than the existing ones that we know.\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community and the official team,\n\nA copy of the detailed proposal can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_NweuAvFyPyb2nWHn4ZaoPf5JPZn5XmteQg2WFjbcU/edit#heading=h.9lx3uiu2vy1q)\n\nSincerely,\n\n1KVnode Team",

      "content": "The goal of the proposal is to fund the Bright Treasury app maintenance costs. We have automated tests and deployment of infrastructure templates with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). The infrastructure as code approach lets us have an easy run and update of the environment.\n\nProject Link : https://treasury.bright.dev Link to any documentation already published: https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\nBright Inventions is a team of 70 developers, project managers, UX/UI designers and operations specialists - experts in mobile and web applications, systems integration, IOT devices and Blockchain platforms.\n\nWe believe that building a software product is about people working together in a collective way. By offering complex support – mobile and web development as well as IT consultancy we try to eliminate roadblocks towards engaging clients as partners at every step of the process.\n\nWe support startups, digital agencies as well as medium to big businesses. We cooperate with startups, accelerators and incubators. Whatever the client profile is, we always aim to establish a satisfying partnership for both sides. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide.\n\nThe BrightTreasury team currently consists of:\n\nAgnieszka Olszewska - Technical Lead, blockchain specialist. She is a senior backend developer with a main interest in data modeling. She started her software development career 10 years ago and from then she began discovering a lot of new technologies. Among them there are JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Postgres, Node.js, NestJS. Most recently she’s been engaged in developing blockchain based solutions with Substrate.\n\nAlisa Kashytska - UI/UX design She is a UI/UX designer with a passion for digging deep into the product domain and understanding the user's perspective. She has worked on the design for multiple web/mobile solutions and lately has been responsible for UI redesign of Parity Building Blocks Android and web apps.\n\nŁukasz Kuderewski - fullstack developer He is an optimist, always willing to learn new things. Mechatronics engineer who fell in love with programming. He has always been interested in a holistic approach to programming problems, which is why after working as a frontend, he is now fulfilled as a fullstack.\n\nRobert Koprowski - fullstack developer, blockchain specialist He is an experienced and ambitious blockchain enthusiast. Graduated from the University of Edinburgh, he lived in various locations around the world to settle now in Gdańsk. Originally a Backend Developer who decided to extend his skills and become Fullstack Developer, always trying to learn something new.\n\nKatarzyna Łukasiewicz - Project Manager She has been working with agile methods for over 10 years, both as a researcher and a practitioner. She believes in teamwork and a power of user centered mindset. With experience in leading international projects, she knows how to support and encourage timely and high quality deliveries.\n\nBased on our 01-03.2022 Maintenance proposal (https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/85/info?networkId=polkadot) we prepared a prediction of costs for the upcoming 3 months.\n\n3 month Maintenance cost projection for April, May, June 2022:\n\n- AWS app hosting prediction for 3 months\t2300 $\n- Self-hosted TeamCity CI server\t                1000 $\n- Infrastructure maintenance activities labour\t5000 $\n- Code maintenance activities labour\t        7000 $\n- Marketing & educational activities labour\t1200 $\n\n                                                     TOTAL\t16,500 $\n\nInfrastructure maintenance activities include:\n\n- AWS logs checkup - scanning the logs and statistics checkup, performed every morning in the work days\n- Incident and problem management - taking action whenever an unwanted event occurs in the infrastructure\n- Infrastructure updates - checking and updating any infrastructure setup when a new version appears\n\nCode maintenance activities include:\n\n- Critical bug fixes (Github issue tracker) - analyzing and performing the required actions whenever a critical issue is raised in the BrightTreasury GitHub issue tracker. Action should be taken within 24hrs from raising the issue.\n- PolkadotJS and stage/testing/production Substrate versions updates - updating the app to work with the newest PolkadotJS versions and automatic testing of the versions in CI\n- Libraries and tools updates - performing any necessary updates of the libraries and tools used with the app\n\nMarketing & educational activities include:\n\n- Publishing 3 blog posts promoting Polkadot and Kusama Treasury mechanisms, BrightTreasury and Web 3.0. Articles are planned to be distributed through various platforms e.g. https://brightinventions.pl/blog https://hackernoon.com/ https://dev.to/ https://medium.com/\n- YouTube tutorial presenting basic BrightTreasury features.\n- Series of Twitter posts regarding BrightTreasury published via https://twitter.com/brightdevs\n\nPayment Conditions:\n\nTotal allocation to be paid in advance for quarterly periods, based on estimations.\nAny fluctuations of the period before will be added in the next one, along with proof of cost, in order to be covered.\nThe team will provide maintenance reports before on-chain submission of proposals to treasuries to cover the above mentioned costs.\nMaintenance costs will be covered by both Kusama and Polkadot treasuries: we aim to submit quarterly proposals alternating between both treasuries, as both networks are integrated to the application.\nToken rate to be calculated based on 30day average tool by Subcan on Polkadot and Kusama.",

      "content": "Proponent: OpenSquare(ESgz7GLVW7BL5DhRgpVnxSXVwaKt4ytWcrf52TY1GQD1cEb)  \nDate: 05/03/2022  \nRequested Allocation: 190.63 KSM (EMA30 price of KSM on subscan is 157.893) \n\n---\n\nProduct link: [https://voting.opensquare.io](https://voting.opensquare.io)\n\nThis product is originally funded by w3f grant and you can find the proposal [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/OpenSquare-offchain-voting.md) and the delivery PR [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/297). We have done a lot of work to improve it, got some achievements and are requesting fund to support the last 4 monthes work after the grant delivery.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn a word, you can see OpenSquare off-chain voting as [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) implementation in the polkadot ecosystem. Users can create proposal with specified block heights and vote off chain with the user balance as the weight. \n\nNow the assets it supports including:\n- substrate based chain native tokens\n- Statemine assets and other assets pallet token on other para-chains\n- ORML assets\n- ERC20 asset on moonriver and moonbeam\n\nMultiple assets supporting make it possible that voting with one asset from different chains. Currently there are no proposals in kusama space, but we can see we support voting with $KSM from Kusama, Statemine, Karura, Bifrost and Moonriver.\n\n## Use cases\n\n### For substrate chains\nMost substrate based chains have onchain governance, but off-chain voting still makes sense with following reasons:\n- Voting from multiple chains. It increases the voters' scope.\n- Gas free. \n- More flexible strategies for voting result. Currently we support `balance-of`, `qudratic-balance-of` and `biased-voting` to calculate the voting result.\n\nAll in all though we have the onchain governance, off-chain voting provides a different way to help community engage more in the governance. We can use it for:\n- Discussions with polls. Onchain proposals are usually formal ones which make users not so easy to express their opinions. But we can even raise some controversial topics with off-chain voting.\n- It can be used as a 'temperature checking' tool before the final onchain proposal.\n\n### For non chain assets\n\nThere are assets in different forms in the dotsama ecosystem. An asset may exists as a Statemine asset, a ORML token, or even a ERC20 token. This off-chain voting tool can be used as their formal governance tool with which nearly all forms of tokens can be used to vote a proposal.\n\n### Examples\n\nFortunately we've got several users.\n- [RMRK](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/rmrk-curation) uses it for the NFT collection curation proposals.\n- [Kintsugi](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/kintsugi) uses it to pre-vote before the onchain proposal.\n- [Karura](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/karura) created a proposal to collect community opinions for 'kUSD Upgrade to aUSD'.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe've got more users.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDYY1Xu.png)\n\n## Work and budget\n\nOur work include:\n- Support statemine assets\n- Support multiple chain voting for one asset\n- Support ERC20 token voting\n- Components polish.\n\nPlease check the [code diff](https://github.com/opensquare-network/collaboration/compare/release-1.2.0...release-1.5.0). We will request about 15 FTE days each month to cover the common structure work. This request doesn't include our customization for the ecosystem projects, and we won't request it from dotsama treasury.\n\n```javascript=\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Item                  | monthes              | Cost    |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Monthly development   | 4(12.2021 - 03.2022) | $30,000 |\n| 15 FET day/month      |                      |         |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Server(Hetzner cpx41) | 4                    | $99     |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Total                 |                      | $30,099 |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n```\n\nPayment conditions:\n\n1.

      "content": "**Proponent:** ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP\n\n**Date:** 27th April 2022\n\n**Requested KSM:** 276.29 KSM\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\n**Raw Data:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SeLZ-N0G55G4JgjncfS-8_kM3L6fWUl5X0SaQMWZ--4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (January, February, March 2022) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n- Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n- Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n- Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we’ve made GitHub issues based on behaviour we’ve observed)\n\n## Service Details\n\nThis last quarter has been huge for Kusama and OnFinality, the demand for our services continues to be another  unprecedented period. January had a larger activity than the rest of the quarter which also had our highest daily response count (for Q1). [Raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nPk1_IPvRj4_8Xpn7Wa2KNjrqXW7kRacP9X0nsCo6fQ/edit#gid=1598230413).\n\nThis quarter was all about service stabilisation as part of the promise we made to this ecosystem to provide enterprise grade services to the community. Our services all exceeded our 99.9% target, with 99.99% uptime for Polkadot over the last 90 days. This is an important measure as we surpassed our largest ever day, with over a billion API responses processed by our service in a single 24 hour period in late January.\n\nBetween 2022-01-01 and 2022-03-31 our Kusama API service has:\n\n- Served a total of 4,975,878,346 (4.9 billion) responses\n- Accumulated over 34 TB of data egress\n- The highest daily total was 85,238,268 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 49 million responses each day.\n- Statemine had over 654 million API responses in the period\n- All time totals for Kusama is 1,186,285,385 (1 Trillion) since November, 2020\n- At the end of this period the 90 day uptime on Kusama and Statemine was 99.99% and 99.97% respectively\n\n[The full proposal is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ezC2j2KbSatjrDIND67H5w8cZntc0Grgfj2Z3267ko/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Proposal for RMRK token sufficiency on Statemine",
      "content": "The RMRK team has been at the forefront of NFT innovation for the past year, inspiring both collaborators and clones in and outside of the Dotsama (Polkadot and Kusama) ecosystem.\n\nBased on our growing social media followership and community engagement as well as the number of projects being launched on the current version of RMRK and planned on the new iterations, there is a clear demand for the technology that we are building. Since we started in April 2021:\n\n- 6700 collections live\n- Total volume of over 500’000 KSM including secondary sales\n- A total of over 30000 unique accounts have listed NFTs on RMRK’s platforms, resulting in current numbers of over 16500 distinct owners of RMRK1 NFTs and over 28500 distinct owners of RMRK2 NFTs: a total of over 35000 currently active collectors\n\nThe NFT 2.0 functionality we have pioneered is also seeing heavy use. To date:\n\n- Almost 100’000 multi-resource NFTs have been launched, NFTs that are multiple things at the same time (a song with a visualization, a profile pic with a static output and a composable one, an ebook that has an audio book counterpart).\n- Over 50’000 equippable NFTs have been launched, with 50 new equippable collections underway and in active development. These are NFTs that can be placed into other NFTs, but are otherwise stand-alone. They are often cross-collection compatible, ushering in a “global item economy”.\n\nWith our EVM and Rust versions in MVP stage, we are on the precipice of being integrated with the majority of the Dotsama ecosystem chains.\n\nThus far, the technology has been largely independent of [$RMRK token](https://singular.app/tokens) use, allowing free and ungated experimentation, building, and ecosystem expansion for both partners and competitors in any direction they choose - with or without our token, and yet, looking at RMRK token activity, there is a clear community demand for more utility and easier use:\n\n- over 4000 holders on Moonriver, Bifrost, Karura\n- over 4300 diverse holders on Statemine alone\n- Tens of thousands of holders on Kucoin and Gate.io\n- over 11% of all RMRK has been bridged over to Moonriver\n- ~35 million USD in weekly volume on Kucoin alone\n\nHowever, with the soon to be released new utilities of the RMRK token, we are encountering multiple pain points related to the token’s presence on the Statemine common good chain.\n\nNotably, our community are experiencing difficulties with regards to transfers, withdrawals, and trading, and these experiences are not only impacting the use of centralized and decentralized exchanges, but also encumbering the development of our [Skybreach metaverse](https://skybreach.app), the intended crown jewel of our project, and a value add for DotSama.\n\n## The Problem\n\nStatemine is a common good parachain in the Kusama ecosystem intended as a common ledger of basic balances of fungible and non fungible tokens. Minimalism is at its core - it lacks programmability on purpose and serves as a “home” for canonical balances of chain-less tokens like RMRK, or Parity’s company retreat attendance NFTs.\n\nTo protect against spam, Statemine uses two methods:\n\n1. It requires a deposit for every new class, a class being a collection of NFTs, or a type of fungible token (e.g. RMRK).\n2. It requires an existential deposit of KSM before an account can be “primed” in order to be able to receive any non-KSM tokens on the network.\n\nThis means that in order to receive a token on Statemine, an address first needs to have an initial balance of KSM.\n\nWith a relatively straightforward implementation of the Teleport function in the default [Polkadot JS UI](https://polkadot.js.org/apps), this is generally not a problem for individual crypto native users. However, it poses an enormous challenge for non-crypto-natives, for multi-signature and hardware-wallet-using investors, and for centralized exchanges. Let’s explore each:\n\n1. Non crypto natives have a hard time navigating the Polkadot JS UI. For these users, the interface is overwhelming and confusing, and no dedicated wallet exists for this particular case of “feeding Statemine accounts with KSM on Kusama'' that would also be usable in other contexts. As such, the only option right now is the admittedly frightening power-user-oriented Polkadot JS UI.\n2. Multi-signature accounts and hardware wallets also suffer from a lack of usability in the Dotsama system, and using them for everyday interactions is often quite difficult. n particular, multisigs are only available on Polkadot JS UI and their use often feels like a black box, especially for non-technical users as they need to wrangle terms such as multisig deposit amounts and call data vs call hashes. Ledger has been notoriously slow in implementing timely support for Kusama and Polkadot, and more recently Statemine, which is complicated further by the fact that these applications are, due to the size of the chain metadata, so large that one usually needs to uninstall all but one app on a Ledger Nano S device.\n3. Arguably the biggest problem of all which trickles down into all other areas are centralized exchanges. They are used to thinking about token transfers through a different mental (and technical) model, and as such find it odd and surprising that they are unable to programmatically generate an infinite amount of valid deposit addresses for a user. Because of the existential deposit, a user is expected to prime their deposit address from Statemine itself, an operation inaccessible from Kucoin (since sending KSM there means sending it on Kusama) and so users are required to teleport KSM into an address on Statemine. To the average CEX user, this is simply an impossibility. This is admittedly a Kucoin UX problem, but it is not being made easier by the fact that (mostly) throwaway addresses (deposit addresses) need to be continuously topped up, lest their balance go too low to accept new token deposits. Gate.io has the same problem.\n\nAll told, the RMRK team has answered over 12’000 support requests from confused users about the RMRK token and its use on Statemine in the past six months. That is only the number of those we as a team replied to - those who figured it out with the help of our ambassadors and community are not counted.\n\n## The Solution\n\nThere are two possible solutions to dramatically improve the usability of RMRK tokens.\n\n1. Give RMRK sufficiency.\n2. Move the RMRK token off of Statemine.\n\nDespite our token already being bridged to [Karura](https://karura.network), granted sufficiency there, and made usable for paying transaction fees, where possible we would prefer to stay neutral. Thus, our preference is option 1.\n\n### Sufficiency\n\nSufficiency is the concept of allowing a token on Statemine to exist and be used without accounts needing an existential deposit of KSM to accept the token.\n\nThis is achieved through a governance proposal passed through the Kusama council or public referendum, and entails “flipping a switch” on the Statemine end.\n\nRMRK has completed the initial phases of our project, and we will soon be further expanding our scope with the launch of a metaverse and accompanying marketing efforts. Consequently, many of the issues identified will be further compounded by further growth of our project. As such, we strongly believe that it is in everyone’s best interest to make RMRK sufficient on Statemine as this, apart from making use orders of magnitude simpler, will allow us to:\n\n- Move RMRK NFTs to Statemine, preventing Kusama node hard-drive bloat\n- Allow trading of NFTs with RMRK tokens as currency\n- Focus on supporting Statemine’s native NFTs as well\n- Deliver the promised token utility without solely migrating to more programmable chains\n\nOur proposal is to make RMRK sufficient through an external governance call, subject to community vote.\n\nCall data on Statemine: \n```\n0x32122000d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c100d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c100d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c100d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c1821a06000100\n```\n\nHash on Statemine: \n```\n0xe5183c1d4c58c6c5ab41b37d753eb6798d7e8f8176af5c8561f7ed8805fd7bab\n```\n\nCall data on Kusama: \n```\n0x630001000100a10f0204060302286bee350232122000d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c100d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c100d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c100d1bc4259aeb77874ee7ca72a9763d6385763068b56bf47fcabd0d854311ab7c1821a06000100\n```\n\nHash on Kusama: \n```\n0xb42f79bdb3eb16cb3d8d00bdafa4b41eee6e29813f3e098769b9ff0218c6be99\n```\n\nWe would like to thank Raul Romanutti for help with this proposal!",

Currently, on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsP0zGvvzB4RGyDYHkDdmUA) you can find two playlists, one for [Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAPR14k1-zSpznR-HSNYHaqa) and one for [Kusama](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAP3PysUxiwYGW7aHsC60TnN). Both have 19 videos. Cumulatively, this equates to 42,040 views, 1,085 comments and more than 8,000 watch hours.\n\nThe following proposal seeks funding for the production and continued development of the Kusama playlist. Production of video tutorials in Spanish that accompany the user in carrying out functions on the network step by step. These videos explain everything you need to be aware of in a clear and detailed way and show that all the information comes from truthful sources. These educational video tutorials will be created weekly from May 2nd to October 10th.\n\nMy goal is to create a complete playlist on the canary network Kusama, where all its functionalities are explained in a simple and clear way so that any Spanish-speaking user feels welcome when starting out in the ecosystem, feels comfortable when carrying out actions and can use the network safely.\n\nCheck the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzXd7k55l-nX7cXIdwDnA1WwMIKIVCXYMLprlqMraeY/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nOriginal post discussions can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1471).\n\nFurther community feedback may be found on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/cryptonitas_/status/1516360436194717696?s=20&t=kFwOjU9JANdM_ELmYHg2XA).\n\nI encourage you to leave your comment below.",

Generally the maintaining work includes the monitoring of servers, bug fixes, UI/UX tweaks, small features enhacement, some manual work to add necessary infos, etc. We're requesting fund from kusama treasury to cover the work cost. To reduce the review work we align the requests for dotreasury and statescan, and propose them in one proposal. \n\nStatescan is now an explorer implementation for Kusama/Polkadot asset parachains. Users can check the fungible and non-fungible assets on it. We have implemented it for Statemine/Statemint/Westmint.\n\nDotreasury aims to introduce retrospect mechanism for Kusama/Polkadot treasury, while you can see it as a treasury explorer. Check [here](https://www.dotreasury.com/dot/projects/dotreasury) for this project history and [post #352](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352) for the original discussions.\n\n\n## Servers\n\n### For statescan\n\nWe are using 3 Hetzner vps + a 400G volume for production hosting and 2 contabo vps for development.\n\nHetzenr vps for deployment:\n- vps1: CPX31(4 vcpu + 8G ram + 160G) = €12.4/mo\n- Vps2: CPX41(8 vcpu + 16G ram + 240G) = €22.9/mo\n- vps3: CPX41(8 vcpu + 16G ram + 240G) = €22.9/mo\n- volume 400GB = €16.0/mo\n\nContabo vps for development:\n- vps1: 4v + 8G ram + 200G = $6.99\n- vps2: 4v + 8G ram + 200G = $6.99\n\nExpsense:\n\n```javascript=\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Item           | months | Cost    |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzner vps1   | 3      | €37.20  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr vps2   | 3      | €68.70  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzner vps3   | 3      | €68.70  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr volume | 3      | €48.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Contabo vps1   | 3      | $20.97  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Contabo vps2   | 3      | $20.97  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total          | €222.6 + $41.94  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total in $     | $284.22          |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n```    \n### For dotreasury:\n\nWe are using 2 Hetzner vps + 2 external volumes for the production hosting and 1 contabo vps for development.\n\nHetzner vps for deployment:\n\n- vps1 for polkadot: vps1: CPX31(4 vcpu + 8G ram + 160G) = €12.4/mo\n- vps2 for kusama: vps1: CPX31(4 vcpu + 8G ram + 160G) = €12.4/mo\n- volume1 for polkadot: 400GB = €16.0/mo\n- volume2 for kusama: 800GB = €32.0/mo\n\nContabo vps for development:\n- vps1: 4v + 8G ram + 200G = $6.99\n\nExpsense:\n\n```javascript=\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Item           | months | Cost    |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzner vps1   | 5      | €62.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr vps2   | 5      | €62.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr volume1| 5      | €80.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr volume1| 5      | €160.00 |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Contabo vps1   | 5      | $34.95  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total          | €364 + $34.95    |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total in $     | $431.13          |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n```\n\n## Continuous development & daily maintenace\n\n### For statescan\n\n- Bug fixes including asset analysis, dot price tracker and the price chart.\n- Code refactor including removing useless packages, upgrading dependencies.\n- Improve the IPFS parsing scripts so we can parse some NFT images on westmint.\n- Collecting and updating some fungible assets info.\n- Server deployments and handling issues like scaning stopped by node connection problems.\n\nWe will request 4 FTE work cost each month for the work.

      "content": "Dear Kusama community\n\nWe would like to submit a treasury proposal for the maintenance of polkachu.com for Q1 2022. This quarter, we released two important new product: [Node Snapshots](https://polkachu.com/snapshots) and [Payout Guards](https://polkachu.com/payout_guard). And we continue to maintain a few projects, including a popular dashboard for the Thousand Validators Program, a validator/nominator search portal called Scout and many other smaller features.\n\nBefore we submit the proposal on-chain, we initiated a polkassembly discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1450). \n\nThe detailed proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/PolkachuIntern/treasury_proposals/blob/main/polkachu_2022q1_maintenance.md). \n\nBetween the initial polkassembly post and today, we made two changes in the detailed proposal:\n\n1. Added $173 snapshot server cost that we initially left out. [Github Commit](https://github.com/PolkachuIntern/treasury_proposals/commit/2ceda89f5413ca5366ba5efe569d642f9334eb02)\n2. Updated the Subscan EMA30 number on the day of proposal submission. [Github Commit](https://github.com/PolkachuIntern/treasury_proposals/commit/1c55b9a0b68cad57c4b841bded563c930771b52b)\n\nWhile our work contributes to both Polkadot and Kusama communities, we believe that the amount is reasonable enough to just ask from the Kusama Treasury. \n\nThank you for your consideration!\n\nPolkachu",

(This toolkit can be used for all Substrate based nodes.) For this next Quarter we aim to implement **Improved Workload Modeling** and **Test Plans**.\n### Report\n\nOur Kusama RPC node served on average **5,570,105** requests per day during the last quarter.\n\nIn our last Kusama Treasury Proposal we received a grant to troubleshoot and analyze the performance issues of the RPC nodes.\n\nWe have [published a report](https://github.com/dwellir-public/rpc-perf/blob/main/report.md) about our findings and developed an [RPC performance toolkit](https://github.com/dwellir-public/rpc-perf/) for node operators.\n\nThanks to the work we have done with the performance toolkit our RPC service capacity and stability has now increased.\n\n- Our full proposal can be [read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15JfkUuuOSHiL4sfyl-M7gp9xoAIMLObzYYMOvSm3zWg/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "content": "Dear Council,\nThe first item of the RMRK2 Collection has already been sent out. \n\nFirst time voters now receive a [shelf](https://singular.app/collectibles/11922926-3208723ec6f65df810-SHELF-VS-203) and an [item](https://singular.app/collectibles/11922939-3208723ec6f65df810-ITEM-181-203). Each time they vote on a Referendum an additional item gets added to their shelf which they can equip. The first item has been sent out to voters of Referendum 181. This proposal is to cover Milestone 2, 3 + General. My aim now is to make the collection economically viable on its own as to not rely on Treasury spending in the future. This is to be achieved through the creator royalties made possible in RMRK2.0.0\n\nThe full [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfgM_z3bDznbDa5ee2HBLRoqW10BShwJnD6hmSjODCs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginally I planned to do a pixel collection due to the difficulties I had finding artists. Now that I have a good working relationship with several, it became possible to create a more artsy collection. I adopted some of the ideas brought forward by Bruno in the [original community post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1358) and thus the current collection was born. While it is not what I promised to build in the original proposal, I trust that the community will agree this to be a more fun and interactive collection. Since I now also incur artist fees for the rmrk2 collection, I hope that everyone sees this change as overdelivering rather than underdelivering.\n\nIt has been fun to build this project and I am thrilled to have gotten so much great feedback already. I look forward to continuously improving the collection and driving governance participation further!!!\n\n[A deep dive into the past, the present and the future of the Referendum Voting Rewards Project.](https://app.subsocial.network/6214/referendum-voting-rewards-the-past-the-present-the-future-32141)\n\n",

      "title": "Bounty proposal: Visualize polkadot bounty program phase 1",
      "content": "Dotsama has more rich features compared to 1st generation state transition blockchains like Ethereum and UTXO based chains like Bitcoin, but at the same time it's more complicated for people to understand them. We propose to implement a group of **business oriented** explorers and Dapps to help users better understand and work with dotsama.\n\nThe implementation will be done through bounties and child bounties, and we propose ourself OpenSquare to be the curator. We will split the work into child bounties, build a site for curator and external developers to collaborate on child bounties, and report back the development progress to the council.\n\nSo this proposal has following motivations:\n\n1. Implement a group of **business oriented** explorers and dapps.\n\n2. Educate more developers by implementing the explorers and dapps features with child bounties.\n\n3. Seek ways to facilitate collaborations between projects and external developers in the polkadot ecosystem. We will experiment the way `bounty -> curator(OpenSquare) -> child bounties -> developers` in this proposal.\n\n## Problems statement\n\n### Rich features need visualization\n\nNo doubt polkadot has more rich features compared to 1st generation state transition blockchains like Ethereum and UTXO based chains like Bitcoin，such as forkless upgrade, on-chain governance mechanism, treasury, para-chains, etc. But to be honest it’s more complex too, which means it will cost more for people to understand them. We need better UIs to demonstrate them. They should show the participating roles, workflows, business life cycles, and to a user, it should tell the steps to complete a business.\n\n### Dapps with more contextual info\n\n[Polkadot/Substrate portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/) is great, but it has problems too.\n\n1. Most shown data is on-chain, while we have to check the contextual info from a explorer to complete some operations.\n\n2. Too advanced to some non-technical users, while they expect simpler ones.\n\nThe proposed business oriented explorers can provide the contextual data, and it will be perfect if we can complete our business just on these business explorer pages.\n\n### More builders, more collaborations\n\nWe need more developers, designers, educators and other roles to build web3 based on substrate/kusama/polkadot. The best way to enroll more builders is collaboration. Bounty & child bounties will be good ways to start collaborations, between curators, child bounty curators and implementers.\n\n### Solutions & Implementations\n\nOpenSquare proposes the big bounty, becomes the curator and then creates child bounties, assigning them to external developers. Deliveries will include:\n\n- Identity pallet business explorer and user interfaces to register and request judgement.\n\n- Vesting pallet business explorer and user interfaces to `vest_transfer` and `vest`.\n\n- Basic block/extrinsic/event pages for relay chain.\n\n- A bounty collaboration site where curator can collaborate with child bounty hunters.\n\nThere will also be other business implementations in the future plan, including governance, society, para-chains, etc. For more detailed proposal context, milestones, budget, deliverables and plans, please check the [full proposal](https://hackmd.io/@WIq3uV0rRwS6W3GGj2pmyA/Sy9-nCF9t).\n______________________\nWe are [OpenSquare](https://www.opensquare.network/team/) team, dedicated to facilitate the collaboration between projects and developers.",

      "content": "In order for parachain to communicate with each other, they need to have a HRMP channel opened first. Currently the maximum number of HRMP channel allowed on Kusama 10. We have 27 parachains at moment and Karura is already have 6 channels and working with many more parachains on opening more channels. 10 channels is simply not enough. There are overheads on relaychain per each established HRMP channels and therefore we needs an upper limit. However similar to number of parachains, we do not know the upper limit value and will want to gradually increase the limit and observe the performance of Kusama. This also helps to configure a safe limit for Polkadot. This proposal aims to increase the maximum number of HRMP channels from 10 to 30. Note that number of inbound and outbound channels are separate configuration and therefore this is a batch call to update both values. 30 channels should be enough for at least next few months. We have another proposal to increase further if any parachains are approaching this limit and Kusama is still operating fine.",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nAnyone that has found their way over to the democracy tab, knows that currently Kusama still has a dramatic **lack of** community **involvement** in governance. We frequently have appalling voting turnout rates of **less than 1%** or even less than 0.1% on our referenda! This is **not healthy** for the network and in order to become truly **democratic** and **decentralised**, we **NEED** to encourage voting from all members!\n\nWith my latest project I decided to tackle this issue specifically! I wrote a program that **automatically rewards** all **voters** with an **NFT** at the end of a referendum. Some of you will have already noticed those NFTs appear in your wallets for the last few referenda. Today I would like to bring forward my spending proposal for the project for community discussion. I would love to get your feedback!\n\nMore info on the [project](https://app.subsocial.network/6214/incentivising-referendum-votes-31299).\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfgM_z3bDznbDa5ee2HBLRoqW10BShwJnD6hmSjODCs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe link to the [community discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1358)",

The reasoning behind this is a. teams that need to renew will be able to do so, b. renewals are not needed on every upcoming LP, c. allow projects to catch up on development. \n\nThe amended call design will schedule (besides what is already scheduled for LP21 on LP20):\n\n- 6 auctions on LP21 for LP22\n- 6 auctions on LP22 for LP23\n- 5 auctions on LP23: 2 for LP23 and 3 for LP24\n- 6 auctions on LP24: 3 for LP24 and 3 for LP25\n- 6 auctions on LP25: 3 for LP25 and 3 for LP26\n- 3 auctions for LP26, to onboard on LP26\n\nAll of these will be scheduled until the first days of January 2023. \n\n## Call Design:\n\n```\nutility.batch(\n\tcalls: [\n\t\t// 6 auctions for LP22 on LP21\n\t\t// LP21 starts on block 12,700,800, estimated 15 May 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp22',\n\t\t\twhen: 12_700_800,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 6),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 22\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 6 auctions for LP23 on LP22\n\t\t// LP22 starts on block 13,305,600, estimated 26 June 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp23',\n\t\t\twhen: 13_305_600,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 6),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 23\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 2 auctions for LP23 on LP23\n\t\t// LP23 starts on block 13,910,400, estimated 07 Aug 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp23.1,\n\t\t\twhen: 13_910_400,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 2),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 23\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 3 auctions for LP24 on LP23\n\t\t// LP24 starts on block 14,515,200, estimated 18 Sept 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp24,\n\t\t\twhen: 14_112_001,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 3),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 24\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 3 auctions for LP24 on LP24\n\t\t// LP24 starts on block 14,515,200, estimated 18 Sept 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp24.1’,\n\t\t\twhen: 14_515_200,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 3),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 24\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 3 auctions for LP25 on LP24\n\t\t// LP25 starts on block 15,120,000, estimated 30 Oct 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp25’,\n\t\t\twhen: 14_817_600,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 3),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 25\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 3 auctions for LP25 on LP25\n\t\t// LP25 starts on block 15,120,000, estimated 30 Oct 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp25.1’,\n\t\t\twhen: 15_120_000,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 3),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 25\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 3 auctions for LP26 on LP25\n\t\t// LP26 starts on block 15,724,800, estimated 11 Dec 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp26’,\n\t\t\twhen: 15_422_400,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 3),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 26\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t\t// 3 auctions for LP26 on LP26\n\t\t// LP26 starts on block 15,724,800, estimated 11 Dec 2022\n\t\tscheduler.schedule_named(\n\t\t\tid: 'auctlp26.1’,\n\t\t\twhen: 15_724_800,\n\t\t\tmaybe_periodic: (100_800, 3),\n\t\t\tpriority: 0,\n\t\t\tcall: auctions.new_auction(\n\t\t\t\tduration: 27_000,\n\t\t\t\tlease_period_index: 26\n\t\t\t)\n\t\t),\n\t]\n)\n```\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "this proposal covers milestone 1 of the entire project. \n\nBuilding the Kusamaverse, a real-time and persistent 3D home for the Kusama ecosystem. Enabling a new way for users to navigate, connect and contribute to and benefit from the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n- Where the Kusama community can gather, engage into on-chain and off-chain activities, tailored to collective value creation, and can build their own social network economy. \n\n- Where activities like staking, parachain auctions, as well as gatherings, hackathons are directly accessible as a shared experience in the metaverse. \n\nKusama is an experimental development environment for teams who want to move fast and innovate, or prepare for deployment on Polkadot. \n\nThere are limitations to what the Kusama community with its current UX can do. The focus of the current applications, mainly polkadot.js, are on on-chain activities, for technically sound individuals using a complex, very detailed, dashboard. In general, there is lots and lots of information to absorb, and most of the time people don’t even know why certain information is there as it has no context to them. \n\nIt is not a social process where you can meet and learn from each other users, nor is the process inviting to non-technical participants. Staking and other on- and off-chain activities could and should be an attractive and fulfilling experience for a wide(r) audience. \n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/9/3/9/7/93979a20e1ef2dc0ab54c46e5c08355becb205a9/Kusamaverse-1920x1842.webp)\n*Artist impression of what the Kusamaverse **could** look like*\n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/0/e/0/1/0e0164c4bbe30a1f92d492c2452fc3baf30f7f3f/Schermafbeelding_2022-02-02_om_09.58.03-1534x1474.webp)\n\nThe Kusamaverse will facilitate and boost both off-chain activities (like meetups, incubation of initiatives, policy making) and on-chain activities (like staking, crowd-loans, voting). \n\n**About the team**\n\nSince 2013, Odyssey has been active in the, as we call it in 2022, Web3-space. We have been involved and supporting Polkadot and Kusama right from the start in 2016, by giving it a platform at our conferences and enabling over 350 teams to build during our hackathons, with Polkadot experts from Parity on-site giving workshops and assisting builders.\n\n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/a/c/e/2/ace203bb177625b8424742f189f1922bce4636dd/28033836905_cbe97437b9_o-1920x1280.webp)\n\nWe organised Europe's biggest blockchain hackathon and multi-stakeholder incubator, with over 100 partners like the European Commission, Dell, KLM, VMware, IUCN, Vattenfall, Engie and several Dutch Ministries. \n\n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/4/c/9/6/4c96f84911460c15b563f706d0c4ce092222c46a/46713147705_16fe5b24e8_o-1920x1061.webp)\n\nWhen COVID hit, we developed the first version of the Momentum software, as a 3D online mass collaboration arena, to host our annual hackathon with 2500 participants. The prototype of this 3d world premiered at the Odyssey Momentum Hackathon, Nov 2020, with 1600 participants collaborating on 21 hackathon challenges, logged in simultaneously, in one massive [multiplayer 3d environment](https://youtu.be/mwpj70Gcatg). \n\n20 months after this prototype, Odyssey.org now is a digital native foundation established in The Netherlands, with a live product used by several thousand users in multiple 3d worlds that are in production. Anyone can freely experiment and start their initiative in our alpha world: momentum.odyssey.org.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe current proposal for on-chain submission is for milestone 1. Milestone 2-4 we included to give a look into our future thinking and ideas, to be adapted upon after learnings from milestone 1.\n\nPlease find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18DtpAsYRt7kZYY1XJZrBcbruhkWbKZzwJFKnrtTCG0w/edit?usp=sharing), looking forward to questions and feedback! \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Extrinsics.io is an extrinsics building platform that provides an improved user interface and experience for users in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. It has a fresh new take on building and signing extrinsics that enables both regular users and power users to better understand and utilise the extrinsic builder. It will also provide users of the currently available wallets with tools that help make calls to the network that are not currently available in any of those wallets.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AhQwWGr.png)\n\nOur goal with extrinsics.io is to build a platform that makes it easier for new users to understand and utilise the extrinsic builder with more comfort and ease while also making sure that power users can quickly get to what they are looking for when they have to build an extrinsic. Here are some key points that highlight those changes:\n\n- Unified screen for encoding and decoding extrinsics\n\n- Intuitive Decoder View\n\n- An editable decoder UI\n\n- A better interface for the encoder\n\nYou can take a look at the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ty52DlBTx9Lf14vzYnIaIBoRC2kaRCU3EG9B_KRZd3E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe platform would also support signing of extrinsics functions with both Kusama and Polkadot. We would start with supporting both Kusama and Polkadot networks with the option of extending it to other networks at a later stage.\n\nThe proposal consists of just one milestone and an estimated 3 months to complete. After Milestone 0 is completed we plan to make a report that will be shared on Polkassembly and Kusama Direction.\n\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and get your thoughts around the project. Feel free to leave a comment below, or reach out via email, anytime.\n\n- This submission covers the expenses for the entire proposal.\n- Kusama rate at $206.654 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n\n[Link to the recent discussion on Polkassembly](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1328)",

We scaled up the compute component of our infrastructure to maintain service levels as a result. Additionally we are closely watching the work that Dwellir is doing in the ecosystem to propose improvements to the RPC nodes.\n\nAdditionally, our experience shows significant performance improvements in terms of response times when the CPU usage is less than 50%. We observed a noticeable drop of service quality (in terms of response times) when the node is under load.\n\nThis proposal includes combined running costs for our infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine. The total combined running cost is USD $45,949.51\n\n[The full writeup is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzROC1pcn6h6awsxdQ0LB1nOLWzUMNZjK8L2kL_3p_A/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "SNI’s Winter 2022 Hackathon Prizes",
      "content": "\n# Overview\n\nSNI&#39;s Winter 2022 Hackathon is a 3-day online event + 1-day showcase. Sovereign Nature Initiative (SNI) is a non-profit foundation that is building on Kusama and has brought together multiple partners and engineers from the **Kusama ecosystem** including [Kodadot](https://nft.kodadot.xyz/), [Unique Network](https://unique.network/), [Kilt Protocol](https://kilt.io/), and [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), for **two contests** taking place in two separate areas of SNI&#39;s focus. One for tech innovation in the form of a hackathon, and the other as a creative writing competition with NFT generation. Both competitions&#39; results will be showcased in a special &quot;Experimental Zone&quot; in-person event planned for May 21-22 at [De Ceuvel](https://deceuvel.nl/en/) Amsterdam. The pledges we are seeking from the Council will provide prizes to the winners of both contests.\n\n**Venue** : Odyssey Momentum online Hackathon, and De Ceuvel, Korte Papaverweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\n**Time** : February 4th-6th 2022 and May 21st-22nd 2022\n\n**Beneficiary address:**\nG2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\n**Submitter address:**\n G2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\n# **Community Spend &amp; Deliverables**\n\nThe pledges we are seeking from the Council will provide prizes to enhance the reach and impact of these programs – 15,000.00 USD in prizes for the winners of the contests, which will encourage them to continue building their DApps to full fruition, in a final collaborative effort between SNI and both the contest winners.\n\n### Amount to spend from the community pool\n\n15,000.00 USD in KSM equivalent\n\n### Timeline\n\n By Jan 27th 2022\n\n### How will funds be spent\n\nAll the funds will be given as the prizes to the winners of the contests. As follows:\n```\n+------------------------------------------+---------------+\n|            Contest Breakdown             |    Amount     |\n+------------------------------------------+---------------+\n| 1st place for the Winter Hackathon       | 10,000.00 USD |\n| 1st-5th place prizes for Writing Contest | 5,000.00 USD  |\n+------------------------------------------+---------------+\n```\n\n# **Why this proposal?**\n\nWe believe in Kusama&#39;s approach to innovation and its community has proven very supportive to SNI&#39;s cause.\n\nIndeed, two Kusama parachain projects, namely Unique.Network and Kilt Protocol, have agreed to support the 28 SNI Hackathon teams by helping them build their solution. Unique.Network will offer NFT minting support and build a marketplace that creates value through NFTs transaction for the benefit of the regenerative projects at De Ceuvel. Kilt Protocol will offer to the teams&#39; developers support on how to work with the KILT SDK, and integrate the Kilt&#39;s Verifiable Credentials and DID into their Hackathon solutions.\n\nBy getting the councils financial support, the winning team will be able to further develop their solutions after the Hackathon, and further explore and use technology within the Kusama ecosystem. Moreover, this financial support will further the reach and impact of our events, enabling more regen/refi initiatives to be recognized as important players within the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n# **1. About the Tech Hackathon**\n\nWe will conduct an **Online Hackathon** from February 4th-6th, asking teams to develop ideas in **3 categories** with possible approaches listed here:\n\n- **representation of non-human life**\n  - Artistic expressions in digital media that bring to the public narratives from other forms of life that share our existence and that we co-depend to have a thriving planet\n  - Story-telling, UI, UX, user journeys, that aim to broaden the understanding of the public towards other living beings&#39; realities and expressions\n- **governance models**\n  - Web3 software solutions that tackle a particular aspect of governance for conservation, regeneration, and remediation efforts\n  - Treasury management and proposal voting systems\n  - New legal/technical governance models, such as a declaration of independence for non-human species\n  - Land Stewardship (&quot;Land Trust&quot;) and models of public/private/nature governance\n- **nature value capture**\n  - NFTs as an approach to value generation/eco-awareness where value remains &#39;in&#39; specific land/ecosystems\n  - Creative ways to remunerate data collection about ecosystems\n  - Regenerate-to-earn models to incentivize nature stewardship\n  - Data analytics and feedback as an autonomization of conservation practices\n\nThe 28 teams participating in the event will be encouraged by the judging criteria to build the business and architecture models on top of the Kusama ecosystem, specially the hackathon partners, for a DApp that helps the DeCeuvel organization with another income stream based on its on-site Nature, sensors data, and soil remediation efforts. Learn more about the [SNI Winter Hackathon here](https://sovereignnature.com/projects/odyssey2022).\n\nTo participate the teams contacted us via an on-line questionnaire and application form, that was available on our website, twitter, and other media presences. After that the participants were interviewed and vetted. Then they joined a series of events to learn about the De Ceuvel and the Kusama ecosystem partners.\n\nThe competition has a prize currently composed of donations - 10,000 $OCEAN and 3,000 $POP - and €5,000 fiat prize from SNI. In addition to that, some $KILT and $RARE will be given out to ramp-up participants to build on the protocol.\n\n**Ultimately through this programming we seek to develop tools which can give nature an identity and make it profitable.**\n\n## Judging Criteria\n\nThe judges of the hackathon in collaboration with stakeholders from De Ceuvel will be looking for the DApp ideas that show original and radical thinking while being grounded in technology and applications that can be used by people, and that have potential for practical impact.\n\nJudging criterias are divided into:\n\n- **Originality** - does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem? A great idea should wow both the judges and other hackers.\n- **Usefulness** - is the idea for the App practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfill a need people caring for De Ceuvel really have?\n- **Learning** - did the team factor in all their disposable resources and time in order to come up with the final product? How strong is their awareness of how others are attempting to solve the same problem?\n- **Adherence to Theme** - does the idea for the App adhere to the event&#39;s themes - the De Ceuvel, the 3 categories, and the Kusama and partners ecosystem? Does it implement each theme fully or just partially?\n\nA score card will be given to each Judge to help assess each DApp idea based on the criterias and scores.\n\n## Hackathon Event Schedule\n\n**February 4: 3 pm - 5 pm** - Hackathon opening convening\n\nSNI presents the challenge and welcome Teams to give a two-minute presentation of their initial ideas and vision\n\n**February 5: 1 pm - 6 pm** - Advisors sessions and Judges visits\n\nTeams meet with Advisors from diverse fields and Judges to validate what they are building. All these meetings will happen in the SNi metaverse\n\n**February 6: 5 pm** - DELIVERABLES DEADLINE\n\nTeams send all deliverables by email to the SNI team\n\n**February 6: 5 pm - 7 pm** - PITCH session\n\nTeams will have a 7-minute slot to present their solutions.\n\n**February 7: 5 pm - 6.30 pm** - Announcing the winning teams\n\nUpon the announcement, winners will be invited to briefly present their solution to the audience and receive (digital) applause and congratulations.\n\n## Judges and mentors\n\n- [**Danielle Bennett**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielleabennett), Investor, Blueyard\n- [**Trent McConaghy**](http://trent.st/), Co-Founder, Ocean Protocol\n- [**Karl Burkart**](https://www.oneearth.org/contributor/karl-burkart/), Deputy Director, OneEarth.org\n- [**Ewald Hesse**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edhesse/) **:** Co-Founder &amp; Supervisory Board Member, SNI; CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Grid Singularity\n- [**Andrea Leiter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-leiter/) **:** Co-Founder, SNI; Associate Professor of International Law at University of Amsterdam\n- [**Catherine Bischoff**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinebischoff/) **:** CEO of SNI\n\n# **2. About the Nature Speaks Writing Challenge**\n\nIn the arts sector, we will host and judge an **open creative-writing competition** called _ **&quot;Nature Speaks!&quot;** _ asking for original nature-inspired literature that broadens human perception and helps us question nature&#39;s otherness. Creative writers, especially those working in web3 / online spaces and innovative publishing platforms, are invited to submit an original work of prose or poetry in the &#39;voice&#39; or from the point of view of one or more nonhuman organisms (plant/animal) or any other aspect of nature. Winners and runners-up will see their writing published in an online publication, featured at the Experimental Zone event in Spring 2022, and the first prize winner will see their writing published and minted as an NFT using the support of the Unique.Network parachain.\n\n## How can people participate?\n\nIndividuals can submit their pieces by March 15 via a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLu7ehHHwlOLSiMuBlMIfva2kWfak1TiDM0bzEzNRm3QfZcg/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0) accessible via the Sovereign Nature website.\n\nIf anyone has questions about Nature Speaks! Literature competition, they can get in touch with SNI Writer in Residence and Challenge lead Seth Bockley at: seth@sovereignnature.com\n\n## Why A Writing Competition?\n\nWe at Sovereign Nature Initiative believe that art empowers wider and wilder engagement with our world and with the mysteries of nonhuman life. We believe that writing alongside nature can broaden human perception and help us question nature&#39;s otherness. We want to think about ourselves and our language as a metaphor for nature, and not just nature as a metaphor for us. We believe that storytelling has the ability to empower and inspire human communities to listen and look more carefully, to smell, taste and touch the deeply entangled world around us.\n\nWe&#39;re inspired by storytellers and thinkers like [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://gnomelife.bandcamp.com/album/be-earth-now-joanna-macy-anita-barrows-recite-selections-from-rainer-maria-rilkes-the-book-of-hours), [Sophie Strand](https://www.instagram.com/cosmogyny/), [Richard Powers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180098-the-overstory), [Wendi Yan](https://eco.mirror.xyz/8_z5JQrhmCAVSU6vi4V7_r7M6HQ-pOWuAVdTNPPtIJY) and [Robert Macfarlane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2688775-the-wild-places).\n\n## Why Kusama and NFTs?\n\nA work of creative writing is like the experience of an organism in the world: it is non-fungible, non-repeatable, unique. Artists and writers capture the value of human-nonhuman entanglement beyond what we can quantify using standard economic and ecological models. We believe NFTs can help these same artists value and share their work– this technology has already greatly impacted the visual arts ecosystem but has yet to make an equivalent impact on literature. As always, SNI wants to be ahead of the curve and anticipate and pioneer how the most powerful nature-writing of the future will be valued and published.\n\n## The Prizes\n\nThe grand prize winner will see their writing made into an NFT by \\*[Unique.Network](http://unique.network/).\n\nThe winner and runners-up will split a bounty of $5,000 USD in KSM equivalent and be published on SNI&#39;s website, and featured in our digital compilation _Leaves of Grass 2.0_ at SNI&#39;s Experimental Zone event held at Amsterdam&#39;s De Ceuvel in May of 2022.\n\nA judging committee made up of writers and scientists will determine winners based entirely on the originality and affectiveness of the works submitted.\n\nAt every resale of the artwork 10% of royalties will be donated to a rewilding or conservation campaign designated by the artist and SNI at time of the NFT&#39;s creation.\n\n\n# **About Sovereign Nature Initiative**\n\nFounded in 2019, Sovereign Nature Initiative (SNI) is a non-profit Netherlands-based foundation that is reconfiguring the intersection between ecology, economy, and emerging web3 technologies, and aims to **achieve a thriving planet by reconfiguring nature&#39;s value.** To support this vision, SNI&#39;s tech stack is being developed in Substrate while we host hackathons to engage developers communities and get their constant feedback. We have brought together multiple partners and engineers from the Kusama ecosystem including [Kodadot](https://nft.kodadot.xyz/), [Unique Network](https://unique.network/), [Kilt Protocol](https://kilt.io/), and [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), and are looking for any other initiative in the Kusama ecosystem that is willing to help us **break the cycle of human domination over &#39;nature&#39;**. Our February 2022 Hackathon is inspired by [De Ceuvel,](https://deceuvel.nl/en/about/general-information/) a post-industrial reclaimed former shipyard in North Amsterdam that operates as a sustainable planned workplace for creative and social enterprises, a unique land trust, and a laboratory for new ideas. Together with other stakeholders who are part of the SNI ecosystem, the top three winning teams will be invited and have the opportunity to showcase their ideas at a public event at De Ceuvel in Amsterdam in May 2022.\n\n## Applicants:\n\n[**Ewald Hesse**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edhesse/) **:** Co-Founder &amp; Supervisory Board Member SNI, CEO &amp; Co-Founder at Grid Singularity\n\n[**Florian Schmitt**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianschmitt/) **:** Co-Founder &amp; Supervisory Board wMember\n\n[**Andrea Leiter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-leiter/) **:** Co-Founder at SNI, Associate Professor of International Law at University of Amsterdam\n\n[**Catherine Bischoff**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinebischoff/) **:** CEO at SNI\n\n[**Jean-Paul Depraz**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauldepraz/) **:** CTO at SNI\n\n[**Seth Bockley**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-bockley-b4273a212/) **:** Writer-in-Residence at SNI\n\n[**Kaidlyne Neukam**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaidlyne-neukam/) **:** Program Manager &amp; Communications\n\n[**Alessandro Mazzi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-mazzi-7a445970/) **:** Project Manager &amp; Partnerships",

      "content": "The team working on Statemine has recently tested adding more collators to Westmint (beyond the genesis `Invulnerables`) and we believe that Statemine is ready for the same. Note that this call needs the Collator Selection `UpdateOrigin`, which is the majority of the Council. That is, it does not require a referendum.\n\nThe team suggested the following values:\n\n- Set the `CandidacyBond` to 50 KSM. This means that an account that wishes to be a collator would need to reserve 50 KSM on Statemine in order to register their intent.\n- Set the `DesiredCandidates` to 4, allowing 4 additional collators to join. This is the number we tested with on Westmint and are confident will work without issue.\n\nOnce the team gets and address feedback from the first collator cohort on the setup process and documentation, they will suggest increasing the number of candidates if there is demand. \n\nMore information on the proposal, including call construction from Statemine, the relay chain and call data, can be found [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1290).

It requres work like theme design, DOT price track, code refactor, block meta scan, etc.\n- Performance improvement\n  - Home page search performace improvement\n  - Block/extrinsic/events first list page perforce improvement by introducting cache\n- Feature enhacement like extrinsic/events filter improvment, 404/500 and other error pages customizatioin, extrinsic/events params shown improvement, etc.\n- Bug fixes includes nft/asset approvals, destroyed assets holders, etc.\n- Create google form to collect asset info.\n- Monitor scripts are created to check the service failure and restart the services.\n\nwe request one developer 14 days work cost for last 4 months, and it's $500 * 14 = $7,000.\n\n## Metrics\nPlease check the 30 days and 24 Hours metrics from cloudflare. \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Cu2RWn6.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/8nSJyRs.png)\n\n## Total cost & payment conditions\n\n```javascript=\n+------------------------------+-------------------+---------+\n| Item                         | Duration          | Cost    |\n+------------------------------+-------------------+---------+\n| Servers                      | 09.2020 - 12.2020 | $210.48 |\n| (see details in above table) |                   |         |\n+------------------------------+-------------------+---------+\n| Continuous development       | 09.2020 - 12.2020 | $7,000  |\n| and daily maintenance        |                   |         |\n+------------------------------+-------------------+---------+\n| Total                                            | $7,210  |\n+------------------------------+-------------------+---------+\n```\n\nPayment conditions:\n\n1. The work is for both kusama(Statemine) and polkadot(Statemint), but to make the on-chain work simple, we apply from kusama and polkadot in turn every 4 monthes.\n2. We will use the 30 day avg rate from Subscan to calculate the total KSM allocation at the day of submission.",

We found a problem, during the last quarter, with the scaling of the RPC-service and have spent a lot of time troubleshooting this bottleneck. We published a report in [this Github-issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4064#issuecomment-979449201) about it. This optimization work will reduce the cost for all RPC service providers in the community.\n\nThis proposal only covers Milestone 1 and 2 for now, while in upcoming maintenance proposals we will submit Milestone 1 (continued maintenance) and Milestone 3 (further development of the RPC code).\n\n- Our RPC service is online and the pull request can be [found here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/6620).\n\n- Our full proposal can be[ read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1AjPj8yfi4JPvR0sCdh0sdBGGduIPkeRxAwTpPGD-U/edit).\n\n- KSM rate base on 30 day avg tool by Subscan: [Available HERE](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).",

      "content": "This treasury proposal is Between the Kusama Council and MIDLDEV OÜ, a company registered in Estonia with registry number 14973249, commonly known as MIDL.dev.\n\n## Service description\n\n- A functioning infrastructure to provide usable blockchain database snapshots for the Kusama network, to the benefit of node operators and validators,\n\n- New snapshots at least once per day. Snapshots are filesystem dumps of the Kusama node storage backend files, of variety RocksDb, of type pruned, with a depth of 1000 blocks, compressed in 7z format, that can be used by validators to quickly spin up or restore their infrastructure,\n\n- A website frontend at polkashots.io with relevant metadata and download links, including a permanent link that always redirects to the most recent snapshot,\n\n- Best effort incident and problem management,\n\n- Redundant implementation setup which allows for continuity, seamless upgrades and basic disaster recovery & contingency management.\n\n## Context\n\nNode operators must have a contingency plan for loss of storage. For us at MIDL.dev, it consists of regularly taking snapshots of the node filesystem and backing it up for recovery if needed. We regularly generate these archives for our own benefit as well as the community. All cloud automation code used for generation of snapshots is open-source so node operators can easily replicate the setup in order to be in full control of the generated snapshots.\n\nThe website polkashots.io has been operational for a year now and providing Polkadot and Kusama pruned snapshots for validators. It has had excellent uptime. It is very frequently mentioned in the Validator Lounge Matrix channels and there are youtube videos referencing them. It is beneficial to the ecosystem by providing a path for validators to quickly and safely recover from a storage failure or migrate their operations.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe warp sync feature has been implemented in Polkadot 0.9.9, however it still requires several hours for a full sync.\n\nA unique snapshot service that many independent validators relies on constitues a centralization risk. It remains our hope that other ecosystem participants will step in and offer an alternative service.\n\n## Operational expenses\n\nThe labor cost is 660 EUR/month including 2 engineers in 2 geographical locations (Western US and Western Europe).\n\nIn addition, we pass along the cloud costs with a 30% markup.\n\nPolkashots is hosted on google cloud. Google cloud has the concept of \"projects\" which allows for segregation of costs. The cloud cost is determined as follows:\n\n- from June 1 to October 10, 2021, polkashots was hosted in a google cloud project shared with other MIDL.dev services named \"MIDLUS\" for which we estimate about 30% of the costs were incurred by generation and download of Kusama snapshots.\n\n- from October 11, 2021 to November 30, 2021, we moved polkashots to a dedicated google cloud project named \"MIDLPS\", allowing for the most precise cost calculation. We arbitrarily allocate 50% of these costs to Polkadot and 50% to Kusama. A dedicated project for each network would incur overhead costs that we do not feel are necessary.\n\nA majority of these costs are network egress. Google cloud egress costs are in the higher range, similar to Azure and Amazon. Google cloud has two tiers, premium ($0.12/Gb for most regions) and standard ($0.85/Gb for most regions). The premium tier is using google private network across the globe. Polkashots uses the premium tier.\n\nThe costs have gone upwards after the introduction of parachains. This is due to the increased storage requirement of the relay chain node in the presence of parachains: as of this writing, a pruned kusama node with 1000 blocks uses 50Gi of storage (7z compressed). In other terms, it costs the treasury $6 each time someone downloads a Kusama snapshot.\n\nThe usage of the best cloud platform money can buy is justified by the benefits: a faster download speed and better reliability means that the nodes are more apt to recover quickly in case of accidental loss of storage, making the entire network more resilient.\n\nScreenshots of the billing console are attached for reference.\n\n## Usage\n\nFrom the MIDLPS billing screenshot, we can see 17,262 Gibibytes of download from the period Oct 10-Nov 31 from all regions excluding Asia and Australia. Polkadot snapshot size is 17Gi and Kusama snapshot size is 50Gi, so assuming a medium download file size of 34Gi, there were 500 downloads during the period, or 10 downloads per day. This is a combined figure for Polkadot and Kusama networks.\n\n## Note\n\nThis proposal is for the Kusama portion of polkashots. We will be submitting a similar proposal to the Polkadot council.\n\n## Budget\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/zfBG5VM/Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-09-14-55.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Zhvhz8F/Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-09-15-06.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/MhzkMKF/Screenshot-2021-12-16-at-09-15-13.png)",

The development and transition expenses were covered by the donation from DFG ([link](https://twitter.com/NovaWalletApp/status/1457710380537585665)).\n\nThis proposal covers further evolution of Nova Wallet as a mobile application in the Polkadot ecosystem, **aiming to extend the feature** set of mobile applications by allowing users to connect to any web app (DApp) in the ecosystem, **interact with Statemine/nt assets** (tokens, NFT), and **improve existing feature set based on community feedback.**\n\n\n**Please review the full proposal with a detailed description & costs:** \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W5EYOi8lxE6Xx3Zk9TKKrCOPGLYxqlcgjm0fgw5gaow/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W5EYOi8lxE6Xx3Zk9TKKrCOPGLYxqlcgjm0fgw5gaow/)",

      "content": "\nThis is the first milestone of \"Robots Waiting for Kusama\" proposal. \n\nThe initial post is here: https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/297. The detailed document is avaliable on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jnnlEmOayiFt3bAajsXa3a3qbAKEWbSA7P0Oup-NhmU).\n\nThe purpose of the proposal is to demonstrate current capabilities of Kusama network for robotics technicians working or studying at universities by presentation of already available web3 tools. A large-scale demonstration with colleagues from partner universities will be conducted for this, in which various robots will function, being integrated in a test environment using the Robonomics parachain. The proposal is divided into 5 milestones with 10 robotic devices each + the last milestone for final montage and summing up.\n\nThe first milestone includes:\n- Negotiations with universities about robotic devices for demonstration (10 devices for this milestone).\n- Coordination and technical support of participating university members.\n- Preparation devices and the formation of deliverables.\n\nFor each robot the following will be done:\n- analysis of the ROS-module of the device, correcting the module if necessary, testing the module;\n- robot activation;\n- collection and sending of telemetry data;\n- preparation of results: creating video, documenting a repository, posting a report.\n\nFor the first milestone, we are asking for 850 KSM, which will be used to prepare robotic devices (80 KSM per 1 device) + 50 KSM for operational costs. The milestone will take approximately 12 weeks to complete.\n\nThis is a treasury proposal whose proposer address (HqnKDzYBnFpGH5jXYZmUFXFnz76ynKN6nTh3De3oRxA9gYu) is shown in on-chain info below. Only this user can edit this description and the title. If you own this account, login and tell us more about your proposal.",

This proposal covers phase 2 of the project.\n\nAlthough the White Paper and other technical articles about Polkadot and Kusama protocols aim to educate in the understanding of this technology, it is hard for token holders to visualise how the protocol works in an integrated way - this project aims to provide one of the possible visual interpretations of the dynamics behind Polkadot and its elements. The intricacies of showcasing in detail how the Kusama and Polkadot protocols function adds multiple levels of complexities to consider, when designing a piece in conjunction with a preexisting piece of music. This project should be understood as an experiment for educational purposes, playing with the interpretation of a track rhythm and the design chosen to represent the stages of the protocol processes in place, with the goal to understand Kusama's and Polkadot's architecture.\n\nWe're happy to conclude Phase 1 of the project and present you our work so far, as well as the laid out plan for Phase 2.\n\n- Link to Phase 2 of the proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmiokdP7Re4O6YA9ribIgUwQkb07QVhT9BLxaWuyp0g/edit).\n\n- Link to the previous Phase 1 which was approved can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/353).\n\n- KSM rate is based on daily chart by [Subscan](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).\n\n- KSM Rate: 383.69 USD.",

This proposal seeks to obtain funding for the continued operation, maintenance and development of the website.\n\n**Problem Statement:** Parachains are a fundamental aspect of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. It can however be a daunting task to find information on these projects or to compare them directly. This is prevalent during auction periods in which would-be crowd loaners examine prospective candidates.\n\nThe auction mechanism within the ecosystem also has some complexities, it possesses two phases and a random bid winner assessment point. Present auction interfaces focus primarily on which project has raised the most capital. There was no public tool that represented the auction events on a timeline. This representation was useful when examining the events of auction nine (9), in which a project won due to the timing of the candle end.\n\nThe full details of the proposal can be found using [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XG5AnLF5lJtz-Muxqx801ndh_wDN1iWOPk7-2brJGbc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nKusama rate at $405.583 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).\n\nDiscussion was initiated here -> [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1091](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1091).",

      "content": "Speck wallet is a user-friendly web extension that will allow Kusama and Polkadot users to interact with their respective networks within the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Brave. The extension would come with the following features:\n\n- Sending and receiving funds\n- Address book\n- Multi-wallet support - with the goal of having a single wallet focused UI\n- Realtime fiat balance with multiple fiat currency options\n- Access management for apps using the extension\n- Developer documentation for integrating the extension\n- Built in support for staking\n- Hardware wallet support\n\nAnd much more…\n\nYou can take a look at the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3M4A834EcQoV4Qnq-P1HD2L940HDr0e-Xh8QXLrA4U/).\n\nThe extension would start with supporting both **Kusama** and **Polkadot** networks with the option of extending it to other networks at a later stage.\n\nThe proposal would consist of 3 milestones with each milestone being an on-chain submission. The milestone payments would alternate between Kusama and Polkadot with Kusama being the first one.\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and get your thoughts around the project. Feel free to leave a comment below, or reach out via email, anytime.\n\nThis submission covers Milestone 1\n\nKusama rate at $403.06 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).\n\n[Link to recent discussion on Polkadot Discussion.](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1085)",

      "content": "*This proposal for Kusama Treasury covers half of the estimated budget, the other half will be covered by Polkadot Treasury which has already been [approved.](https://polkadot.subscan.io/treasury/71)\n\nPinknode is a node-as-a-service platform specialized in providing quality API endpoints and node operation services to the users in the Polkadot ecosystem. Our mission is to support the Polkadot protocol in achieving its vision of a multi-chain future through providing easy-to-use, reliable, and scalable infrastructure services which removes an entire layer of complexities for developers to start building on Polkadot/Substrate.\n\nWe launched our MVP in June 2021 offering free API endpoint access to users to both Polkadot and Kusama mainnets and testnets. We've served more than 200 million requests through our users' custom endpoints and public endpoints. You may begin utilizing our endpoints by [signing up for an account](https://app.pinknode.io/login) or through our public endpoints listed [here](https://apps.pinknode.io/#/explorer).\n\nIn our Phase 1 proposal, we will be detailing our plan to enhance our front-end for better user experience, management and monitoring capabilities. With these planned enhancements, our users will be able to:\n\n- easily manage their project keys\n\n- uncover valuable insights into their usage methods and patterns, which will positively influence the development of their dApp\n\n- collaborate effectively with other team members to manage infrastructure needs\n\nThis will help advance the developer team’s operational capabilities by providing greater ease of use, visibility, and enhanced account management.\n\nYou can find out more about our proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBWBRNuEl1bJBfiD1TyEZN-k4PonabV2Wr7p8DKED1E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n- This submission covers Phase 1\n\n- Kusama rate at $347.19 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n\n[Link to recent discussion on Polkadot Discussion](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/626).\n",

This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n- Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n- Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n- Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we’ve made Github issues based on behaviour we’ve observed)\n\n### Service Details\n\nBetween 2021-07-01 and 2021-09-30 our Kusama API service has:\n\n- Served an unprecedented total of 8,033,980,647 (8 billion) requests (an increase of 210% on the previous quarter)\n- Accumulated almost 56 TB of data egress (up 335.54% on Q2)\n- The highest daily total was 229,333,292 requests and 1.5TB data egress in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 145 million requests each day.\n- Rococo had over 75 million API requests in the period, and Statemine over 186 million\n- All time totals for Kusama is 10,895,178,172 (10 Billion) since November\n- The last billion Kusama requests took only 7 days\nNote: We have implemented custom middleware in our platform that counts and logs these requests, [you can view the raw data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IgNgwGNQle-8xzS7W3A7PmXX-rI08pknAhG-hllcfw0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRfLGHvC9UgKOU0AFSxOjbtqjm81OBXlSvYt70fK6uGqB1sE0WvPXKRdWv5J3Rf3egvV6pP1cLFZunS/pubchart?oid=577419954&format=image)\n\n### Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Kusama ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n- An improved dashboard for our partners so that they can monitor usage and manage the upgrades of the nodes in real time.\n- Collection of a rich set of metrics and usage data that is securely shared with partners to help them scale and develop their network.\n- Improvements to our routing strategies and scale enhancements to our load balancer with the goal of scaling to a Billion daily requests.\n- A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is met.\n- Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to **every **parachain team at launch\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/).\n\nWe continue to reaffirm our dedication to providing free support of 500,000 requests to our API service each day for users around the world. You can access our public API service by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer) or via the endpoints listed below. You can also [create your own free API key in our application](https://app.onfinality.io) and track metrics and statistics.\n\n- https://kusama.api.onfinality.io/public\n- wss://kusama.api.onfinality.io/public-ws\n- https://rococo.api.onfinality.io/public\n- wss://rococo.api.onfinality.io/public-ws\n- https://statemine.api.onfinality.io/public\n- wss://statemine.onfinality.io/public-ws\n\n[**Full report including detailed data and costing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C7QVo0YCepSk70p3fQKihmoJs9YZunoI_771yxBNRJY/edit?usp=sharing)",

This motion executes the same upgrade as 364, this time with the compressed hash**\n\nThe motion proposes an upgrade of the Kusama Runtime to **v9110** - Release notes, runtime changes and proposal hash can be found [HERE](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.11). Please feel free to use `srtool` yourself to check the proposal hash. If passed by the Council.\n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "This proposal aims to schedule the opening of an **11th auction**, based on Council and community feedback and given there is enough time before the end of the lease period to add one more to the batch. \n\n**Reasoning behind the 11th auction opening**:\n\nAfter consulting with the Parity parachains team on stability and security of the network, the Council concluded that the extra buffer time and the potential positive implications for the network security of a new lease being locked are reasons enough to consider opening a new auction being opened on 06 October, that might potentially open an 11th auction on Kusama: There seems to be a formed majority on this idea. Adding to this, since Kusama is a canary network, demonstrating that Kusama’s governance is flexible in this way can be a positive signal and matches the ‘expect chaos’ idea.\n\nAll in all, **there seems to be an agreement on opening a last motion next Wednesday 06 October** before the current lease period ends. \n\nAfter discussion in the [Direction Channel](https://matrix.to/#/!QXMnIJzxlnVrvRzhUA:matrix.parity.io/$TRAFAyFhb6HD_tAuE2nxusRuM45lqfJmh1OFJpDiRIs?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), it seems like the best approach is to open the proposal for Council to vote on scheduling the opening of the auction at block no. 9,535,569. This number is calculated in the following way:\n\n- 72,000 blocks for the hard-coded 5 days until the current motion ends\n- End of the current parachain auction (1st phase - 2 days): block no. 9,462,968 (as per calendar)\n- 601 blocks (1h to give randomness enough time to choose the winner of the current auction).\n\nSome reasons for a council-only vote, as laid out during the discussion:\n\n- The delicate timing means that maybe the council should initiate this: The people who would be most in favour of this could not vote.\n- There are at least 184k KSM locked that would clearly like another auction slot. \n- Everyone with non-crowdloan KSM has an incentive to delay this, because it will give them at least one extra good project to join in the next batch.\n- An external motion > referendum vote would take the involvement of TC, which would add one layer of complexity to a decision the community seems to be in agreement of. \n- A normal referendum would not make it to enactment on time.\n\nIt is now up to the Council to decide.",

This proposal is the next step and covers the preparation tasks and operation expenses to prepare for the onboarding.\n\nThanks to all the councillors who have already expressed their support for Encointer's ambition by casting their [off-chain vote](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/914) or letting us know privately.\n\n* [proposal description, budget and roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hfofao18fZBK2XxLTZaYAougW2-_tB8UVsEUKVQi4n0/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [In depth polkassembly discussion on the common good character of Encointer](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/610)\n* [Kusama council town hall video recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TSf1vfsA_O3wVhgmFa_Fw22vpuAmSIOY/view?usp=sharing)\n\n# common good social contract\n\nIf you support this treasury proposal, you're also expressing your current support for Encointer to get a common good parachain slot:\n* before slot 20 \n* for 8 lease periods (Encointer communities grow slowly by design, so we need time to show impact)\n\nTowards the end of our granted lease, the following shall be assessed to decide about extending the common good slot lease:\n* Has Encointer implemented a viable solution with regard to its [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.12141.pdf)?\n* Has a first pioneer community evolved into an active ecosystem where a growing number of participants is actively using Encointer currency?\n* Has an integration with another parachain been demonstrated to provide sybil-defense?\n* Is there an interest to launch more communities? How many communities have evolved and how active are they?\n* Has the Encointer Association shown good governance and is there a plausible roadmap towards full decentralization?\n\n# funds\n\nThe proposed treasury spend of 35'800 USD has been translated to KSM at today's 30d average on [subscan EMA30](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) of 364.947 USD",

      "content": "Nibble bits is a creative duo from London, England with over a decade of Visual Effects experience on shows like Jungle Book, which they won an Academy Award for. They've also been honored to work alongside many amazing artists and projects like Ed Sheeran & Chance The Rapper’s music video, The Last of Us 2 trailer, Xbox Series X cinematic, Ridley Scott’s Hennessy short-film and brands such as Apple, Samsung, Heineken, amongst others. In reality though, ‘Nibble bits’ is just the lovechild of two artists making art outside the boundaries imposed by the commercial world.\n\nAlthough the White Paper and other technical articles about Polkadot and Kusama protocols aim to educate in the understanding of this technology, it is hard for token holders to visualise how the protocol works in an integrated way - this project aims to provide one of the possible visual interpretations of the dynamics behind Polkadot and its elements. The intricacies of showcasing in detail how the Kusama and Polkadot protocols function adds multiple levels of complexities to consider, when designing a piece in conjunction with a preexisting piece of music.\n\nThis project should be understood as an experiment for educational purposes, playing with the interpretation of a track rhythm and the design chosen to represent the stages of the protocol processes in place, with the goal to understand Kusama's and Polkadot's architecture. \nNevertheless, the focus should primarily be an amazing looking music video with addictively compelling aesthetics that can be enjoyed as a piece in its own right.\n\nLink to the full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E14oPe0YU8jXA7Rp4khelZwGTNqJsFfEUTi9tRpVrDo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWe're looking forward to any feedback and comments. Really excited to be part of this!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKSM rate based on 30-day average rate tool by subscan - $345\n\nPlease note this proposal covers the first allocation for the work of two months. \n\nA second final proposal will be submitted after pending council review of the progress report.",

The result will be, that users aren’t forced to switch between apps, chains and reload their window context completely.\n\nFirst of all, our aim since every grant till today is to have [an open-source UI with permissive MIT license and support developers to fork and contribute to repository, as till today we have 60+ forks.](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/blob/main/LICENSE) \n\nOur primary deliverable will be an extension of KodaDot: an NFT explorer to **work with the Statemine’s unique** pallet.\n\n**The main goal of this proposal is to provide a simple friendly NFT UI to the end-users to open flood gates to mainstream adoption of non-fungible tokens for Statemine**\n\n**Milestone 1: Non-fungible tokens**\n\nThe first milestone is focused on the three main sections: \n- Teleport $KSM between Kusama Relay Chain and Statemine\n- Implement a user interface to create, burn, transfer NFTs (and many more)\n- Design and setup the SubQuery indexing service, which could be reused by other projects\n\n**Deliverables**\n- Make a page dedicated to creating a unique (NFT) with a simple workflow\n- Ability to create a Class (collection)\n- Show class detail with metadata\n- Show minted NFTs in explorer mode\n- Ability to set and remove approval for instances \n- Display metadata for particular NFT (instance)\n- Transfer (send) ownership for class and instance\n- Set metadata for class and instance\n- Set attributes for class and instance\n- Burn an instance\n- Clear metadata and attributes.\n- Implement a page to teleport KSM between Kusama and Statemine\n- Extend vue-polkadot/api to handle multiple (parallel connections).\n- Provide check if a user has enough balance on Statemine / Kusama to be able to mint and transfer a collection.\n- Implement a GraphQL schema for Classes and instances\n- Extend the embeddable component that will work with the Statemine implementation (note: embeddable component -> <iframe/> which would work as a page generator to show particular collections or by addresses on other existing web applications )\n- Write introduction article around experience with development around unique pallet implementation\n- Write introduction article presenting using KodaDot on Statemine\n\n**Amount required -- 27_000 €**\n\nBudget breakdown\nMilestone 1 - non-fungible interface for Statemine in KodaDot\n- Teleport interface for $KSM - 4k€\n- Implement interface & flow \n- - Easier NFT creation - 9k€\n- - Showcase & Displaying NFT assets - 6k€\n- Design query and deploy SubQuery project - 8k€\n\n\n### Team\n\nThe team behind [@KodaDot](https://twitter.com/kodadot)\n\n- Matej Nemcek ([@yangwao](https://twitter.com/yangwao)) - Co-Founder of KodaDot, VueJS background, more info [hypersignal.xyz](https://hypersignal.xyz)\n- Viktor Valastin ([@vikiival](https://twitter.com/vikiival)) - Co-Founder of KodaDot, [Publication about carsharing dApp on ETH using ERC721 token composition.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335241161_Blockchain_Based_Car-Sharing_Platform)\n\n\n",

      "content": "- **Proponent:** PolkaStats [GTzRQPzkcuynHgkEHhsPBFpKdh4sAacVRsnd8vYfPpTMeEY](https://kusama.polkastats.io/account/GTzRQPzkcuynHgkEHhsPBFpKdh4sAacVRsnd8vYfPpTMeEY)\n- **Date**: 23-08-2021\n- **Requested amount:** 2.939 KSM\n\nHi all,\n\nThis is a new treasury spent proposal to fund PolkaStats operation costs for Kusama network from 01.09.2021 to 01.12.2021.\n\n### CONTEXT\n\n[PolkaStats](https://kusama.polkastats.io/) is a Substrate block explorer aiming to provide the best staking and economic data for both validators and nominators. It helps both types of users by providing comprehensive metrics, charts and utilities to improve their knowledge and performance.\n\nPolkaStats is one of the projects that was born in La Colmena, a crypto community based in Sevilla, southern Spain. The community aims to incentivize content-creation in Spanish for Polkadot, Kusama and other blockchain projects and, as supporters of open source culture, develop software to contribute to the ecosystem. The organization also acts like an incubator that helped create blockchain business models like DragonStake or Delega Networks validators.\n\nAlthough there are currently already some very good Substrate explorers in the ecosystem, PolkaStats has a different perspective to offer in order to increase diversity among the existing solutions. PolkaStats differentiates from other explorers in:\n\n- Focusing on Proof of Stake chains only.\n- Being a full Javascript based block explorer (both frontend and backend)\n- Utilising Vue.js, Nuxt.js and GraphQL with a soft learning curve.\n\n### SPENDING PROPOSAL\n\nPolkaStats aims to submit a spending proposal to the Kusama Treasury on the following terms:\n\n- A 3 month period pre-paid funding for operational expenses, which totals to 2.939 KSM for the period 01.09.2021 - 01.12.2021.\n- KSM base-price is determined using EMA30 price from Subscan: $264.574 (225.60 €)\n- The funds are used to pay the servers we rent to Hetzer and Digital Ocean in order to operate PolkaStats for the Kusama network.\n\n### MONTHLY BUDGET\n\nPlease find below a detailed budget of PolkaStats monthly operational costs for Kusama network:\n\n- Hetzner AX61-NVMe (KUSAMA): 99.96 €\n- Hetzner AX61-NVMe (DEVELOPMENT): 99.96 €\n- ½ Digital Ocean 4 vCPUs 8GB / 160GB Disk (DEVELOPMENT): 16.92 €\n- ½ Digital Ocean 1 vCPUs 2GB / 50GB Disk (MONITORING): 4.23 €\n- TOTAL: 221.07 € / Month\n- TOTAL KSM (1 KSM = 225.60 €): 0.979 KSM / Month\n\nNOTE: Conversion rate of 1 KSM = $264.5745 = 225.60 € was calculated using [EMA30 price](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=KSM&to=USD&time=0) from Subscan at 23/08/2021\n\n### PREVIOUS APPROVED PROPOSALS\n\nProposal I:\n\n- Period: 17.09.2020 - 17.12.2021\n- Document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA) \n- Discussion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/290](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/290) \n- Executed at block #4,086,175 (2020-09-17 11:37:36)\n- Treasury proposal: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/47](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/47) \n- Motion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/214 ](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/214 )\n\nProposal II:\n\n- Period: 17.12.2020 - 17.03.2021\n- Discussion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/480](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/480) \n- Executed at block #6,091,572 (2021-02-06 09:32:12)\n- Treasury proposal: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/77](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/77) \n- Motion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/268](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/268)  \n\n### SOME KUSAMA METRICS\n\nGoogle Analytics metrics of the Kusama version of PolkaStats in the last month:\n\n- 1822 unique users\n- 2385 sessions\n- Visitors from 92 different countries",

      "content": "Copied from [post 816](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/816).\n\nThe MA30 price at subscan is 203.077 at my proposal time, so we request 7850/203.077 = 38.66 KSM.\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n---\n[dotreasury](https://www.dotreasury.com) aims to introduce retrospect mechanism for Kusama/Polkadot treasury, while you can see it as a treasury explorer. Check [here](https://www.dotreasury.com/dot/projects/dotreasury) for this project history.\n\n## Maintenance\n\n### Server\n\nServer fees for 05.2021 and 07.2021: (8vCPU + 16G + 1 TB SSD + 10Mbps) * 3 = $450 * 3 = $1350\n\nservices run in this server:\n\n- 2 polkadot archive node instance for Polkadot and Kusama\n- 1 polkadot-collator archive node instance for Statemine\n- 1 mongodb instance\n- dotreasury\n  - scan scripts for production and staging environments\n  - dotreasury restful server for production and staging environments\n- metadata scan scripts for production and staging. We use these scripts to scan store the raw block/events data, so we don't have to read them from the node.\n- Statescan\n  - scan scripts for production and staging environments\n  - Statescan restful server for production and staging environments\n- Price tracker scripts\n- Some other scripts like monitors\n\nWe'd say this server is a little tired, and we may increase 1 or 2 servers in next season.\n\n### Continuous development\n\nWe are still actively developing to improve it. Please check the code [diff](https://github.com/opensquare-network/dotreasury/compare/e8f09bf9cfcbf352425555734c022c59c9ba72ea...release-2.3.1#diff-0b59de8f2b2804ca9674c9716edbeffaf6038e24c590a42bb0a55dee9052f037) from last delivery. Our work includes:\n\n1. We improved the way to check the target calls recursively, so we won't miss some actions without events, check code [here](https://github.com/opensquare-network/dotreasury/commit/153eeecb65a7d683f45fbf43fd458c1006b7ac5b#diff-0b59de8f2b2804ca9674c9716edbeffaf6038e24c590a42bb0a55dee9052f037R15)\n2. Improve page performance by only connecting 1 node when page init\n3. Add funded projects and related links for proposals manually\n4. Continually track the polkadot.js releases and update dotreasury dependencies to make it work for latest runtime\n5. Some UI improvements and bugs, like show voting members on proposal list, fiat value punctuation, link recognition, etc.\n\nWe request 10 days cost for 1 developer, and it's $500 \\* 10 = $5000.\n\n## Part of M3 work\n\nYou can see the original M3 plan [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#182dea63-f93f-4f66-aa4f-e7a03bb483ab) and a [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/598) we raise about beneficiary credit model.\nWe still can not decide the best model for a credit score, but we can first let the grade action happen.\nThat means councilors and any token holders can grade 1-5 for a proposal and leave a short message, and they have to sign it with polkadot.js extension which we will store to IPFS.\nOf course anybody can see these grades with the verified signatures.\n\nWe request $1500 for this feature development.\n\n## Metrics\n\nPlease check metrics from cloudflare. The visitors are not so many. Sorry that our social media followers are very few and maybe we need some work to promote it.\n![](https://ipfs-hk.decoo.io/ipfs/QmPvXz8NMmK8jTUMVgY8kxTefAEkrrntx6R1boqSZSp2eR?filename=Lark20210802-145516.png)\n\n## Total cost\n\nThe work is for both kusama and polkadot, but to make the on-chain work simple, we apply from kusama and polkadot in turn every 3 monthes.\n\n```javascript\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Description                             | Time          | Cost  |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Server(8vCPU + 16G + 1 TB SSD + 10Mbps) | last 3 months | $1350 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Continuous maintenance development      | last 3 months | $5000 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Support grading and IPFS storage        | 2 weeks       | $1500 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Total                                   |               | $7850 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n```\n\nI will calc the KSM amount when propose it on-chain with the MA30 price if no problems.\n\n---\n[OpenSquare team](https://www.opensquare.network/team), we develop public goods and are dedicated to facilitate the collaboration between projects and developers.",

      "title": "Additional security measure on staking system: setMinimumUntrustedScore",
      "content": "Motion 337 uses a feature added in [a recent substrate PR](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8903) to ensure that the staking system maintains a certain level of quality in terms of backing scores. This is **an additional security measure to the staking system being put into place**, as the signed submissions are opening up in the 9080 runtime upgrade. With this motion, all staking solutions provided to the chain (either by offchain workers or signed miners) will need to attain **at least** the score that is specified in this motion. These numbers are obtained by taking the average score of Polkadot/Kusama election for the last 50 eras, and taking their average, then multiplied by 50% to take into account network variability.\n\nAs an example, we know that the current entry barrier of Polkadot's validators set is around 1.69 MDOT. This motion will impose any validator set elected henceforth to present a least-staked validators of at least 847.4 KDOT (50% of the current average). Similarly, we know that the average amount staked in Polkadot now is around 655 MDOT. This motion will ensure that all staking election henceforth will at least put 327.69 MDOT at stake.\n\nNote that these numbers need to be updated on a semi-regular basis, depending on the staking rate of the network. Although, given that (lenient) 50% threshold applied to the scores, we don't expect this to be very often.\n\nLastly, note that this motion has no impact on the current staking parameters. All validators and nominators continue to operate as they did.\nThe script used to deduce this motion can be found [here](https://github.com/kianenigma/polkadot-election-score-stats/blob/master/src/index.ts).\n\n**Kusama numbers:**\n\n- `2152798229052511`, 2.1527 kKSM\n\n- `2714120481763307659`, 2.7141 MKSM\n\n- `62184223048402160114561549513680866`, 62.1842 ZKSM",

      "title": "Patract's treasury proposal for Ask! v0.3 (AssemblyScript Contract)",
      "content": "This is copy from [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/766](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/766)\n\nAsk!'s goal is to provide a set of contract frameworks and compilation tools using AssemblyScript as the programming language. Contracts written through Ask! can run in the FRAME Pallet-Contracts , and eventually can call each other with contracts written by ink!. One month before, Ask! had completed the development of v0.2, and here was [Development Report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/639), External [Review Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_fEiXdshfeTm8KbKq9JZbdcVv_iQ-LbuWQdYS2k1yKI/edit?usp=sharing) and [Review Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18pfqLaDGbU6EKRKzOMsY40I6kFrlwStWu-g2LaqvOq0/edit) for the previous version. After v0.3, we will release Ask! 1.0 as the first production version for massive test and usage for community developers and detailed [docs](https://docs.patract.io/en/ask/introduction.html).\n\n## Main features of v0.3\n\nThis proposal will complete the following functions on the basis of v0.2:\n\n### 1. Add project management tool `ask-cli`\n\nThe positioning and function of `ask-cli` is similar to that of `cargo contract`, it mainly completes the following functions:\n\n   * Initialize the Ask! project. Provide `ask-cli init` command to create a new contract project. It will mainly complete the following tasks:\n     * Check the current latest version of `ask`, and the dependencies of ask.\n     * Create a project directory and initialize basic settings.\n     * Download/update all dependencies to the local directory.\n   * Encapsulate the compilation process of ask.\n     * Provide `ask-cli compile` command to control the compilation process. The `compile` command will provide two modes of `debug` and `release`, and the default is to use the `release` mode to compile. among them: \n       * In the `debug` mode, debugging information will be generated in the `.wasm` file, and the `.wast` and `metadata.json` files will be generated at the same time, and the files expanded by Preprocessor will be saved to the `extension/` folder.\n       * In `release` mode, the highest level of optimization options will be used to compile, and only `.wasm` and `metadata.json` files will be generated.\n\n### 2. Performance optimization\n\n#### 2.1 Merging the functions of `@storage` into `@contract`, reducing the process of state variable definition.\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2 version, the `@storage` annotation was introduced, which is specifically used to mark that a certain class is used to save state variables, such as:\n\n```typescript\n@storage\nclass StateVariable {\n  varA: i8;\n  varB: u8;\n  @ignore\n  varC: bool\n  // ...\n}\n\n@contract\nclass Contract {\n  sv: StateVariable;\n  // ...\n\n  @message\n  msgA(): void {\n    this.sv.varA = 8;\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this implementation method, the original purpose is to distinguish state variables and ordinary variables, so that when some parameters need to be passed across methods, ordinary variables can be used without additional storage burden, but this requirement is in v0.2 With the introduction of `@ignore`, there can be better implementations. At the same time, the use of `@storage` to distinguish variable types has obvious disadvantages:\n\n1. Introduced additional coding burden, each time you use it, you need to use the writing method of `this.sv.varA`.\n2. When the contract has an inheritance relationship, it is not convenient to arrange the storage location of the data in the subclass and the parent class.\n\nTherefore, in v0.3, the functions of `@storage` and `@contract` will be merged. The contract in the above example can be written more directly as follows:\n\n```typescript\n@contract\nclass Contract {\n  varA: i8;\n  varB: u8;\n  @ignore\n  varC: bool\n  // ...\n\n  @message\n  msgA(): void {\n    this.varA = 8;\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.2 Optimize the key generation logic used when storing state variables: Use continuous hash data instead of dynamic hash(string).\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2, the key used when storing state variables is obtained by calculating `hash(\"_lang_ask.contract.varA\")`. This generation method is not convenient for more reasonable arrangement of storage locations, especially for collection types such as map and array.\n\nIn v0.3, for non-@ignore variables defined in the contract, storage locations will be generated in an orderly manner according to their declaration order (including variables of the parent class), as in the above example。The storage location of `varA` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`, the storage location of `varB` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`... and so on.\n\n#### 2.3 In the process of a message call, when the value of the state variable is changed multiple times, reduce the number of calls to `seal_set_storage`\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2, every time the value of the state variable is changed, the `seal_set_storage` method will be called in real time to save the result to the chain. The advantage of this implementation is that the value of the state variable will change in real time, which is very important when calling each other across contracts. But in most cases, it is not necessary to update state variables in real time, which will waste gas and consume IO operations.\n\nIn v0.3, the state variable will be updated in a lazy way, that is: in the process of a message call, the value of the state variable can be modified multiple times, but only after the message call is completed, will the final result be saved to the chain , So no matter how many times the state variable is modified, the `seal_set_storage` method will only be called once. At the same time, in order to meet the need to update state variables in real time when calling across contracts, a new annotation `@immediately` is introduced, which is annotated on state variables. If the state variable of @immediately is modified, its value will be real-time Update to the chain.\n\n```typescript\n  @contract\nclass Contract {\n  varA: i8;\n  @immediately\n  varB: u8;\n  // ...\n\n  @message\n  msgA(): void {\n    this.varA = 9; // won't update onchain value\n    // ...\n    this.varA = 18; // won't update onchain value\n    this.varB = 19; // update onchain value to 19 immediately\n    // ...\n    this.varB = 29; // update onchain value to 29 immediately\n\n    // ...\n    // update onchain value of this.varA to 18\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.4 Define the export format of Map and Array in metadata.json.\n\nIn v0.2, we provide the implementation of `StorableMap` and `StorableArray`, and in spread mode, they are saved as a doubly linked list, so that you can iteratively access all the data in `StorableMap` and `StorableArry` offline through the information provided in metadata.json. In order to achieve this goal, we will generate the necessary information for the StorableMap and StorableArray in the `storage` object of metadata.json. For StorableMap, its storage information is like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"someMap\",\n  \"layout\": {\n    \"struct\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {// StorableMap info of entry node\n          \"name\": \"entries\",\n          \"type\": \"spread\", // storage mode, \"spread\" | \"packed\"\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"key\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\" // storage position\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"key\",\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"ty\": 5 // data type of key\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"value\",\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"ty\": 5 // data type of value\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor StorableArray, like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"someArray\",\n  \"layout\": {\n    \"struct\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {// StorableArray info of entry\n          \"name\": \"entries\",\n          \"type\": \"spread\", // storage mode, \"spread\" | \"packed\"\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"key\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\" // storage position\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"key\",\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"ty\": 5 // data type of key\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.5 Use JSON instead of `()` annotations\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2, the parameter of the annotation is provided by `()`, such as`@message(payable = true, selector = \"0x1234\")`. In v0.3, it will be: `@message({payable: true, selector: \"0x1234\"})` to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n#### 2.6 Enhance `Event` syntax, provide js library for parsing Event data\n\n   * Support @event inheritance\n     Event is essentially derived from the `_lang.Event` class, in terms of syntax they should support inheritance. But in v0.2 does not support inheritance operations, in v0.3, we will support the Event class can be inherited.\n   * Optimize the constructor and implementation method\n     In v0.2, because of the functional limitation of Proprecess, when we generate the Event construction method, we call the `emit` method by default, and the code of the Event class after the Preprocessor is expanded:\n\n```typescript\nclass Transfer extends _lang.Event {\n  private from: AccountId;\n  private to: AccountId;\n  private value: u128;\n\n  constructor(from: AccountId, to : AccountId, value: u128) {\n        super();\n        this.from = from;\n        this.to = to;\n        this.value = value;\n\n        // code inserted by compiler\n        this.emit();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation has the following problems:\n\n1. If the `return` method is called in the constructor method, the `this.emit` method will not be called, resulting in the event not being sent.\n2. The emit is defaultly used when constructing the Event, which is very unintuitive in coding.\n\nFor these reasons, we will optimize the implementation of Event to avoid the above problems by providing js library to parse Event data.\n\n#### 2.7 Enhanced annotation syntax and parameter checking\n\nIn the previous version, we have successively introduced multiple annotations, sub-annotations and annotation parameters, but before compilation, there was no good check during compilation, and no clear enough prompt information was provided when an error occurred. So in the v0.3, we will check all annotations and parameters in Preprocess, and provide friendly compilation information when errors occur.\n\n#### 2.8 Optimize the size of the generated wasm file\n\n#### 2.9 Upgrade the seal_xxx method in pallet-contract\n\nSome `seal_xxx` methods in `pallet-contract` have been changed. In v0.3, the changed methods will be upgraded to the latest stable version.\n\n### 3. Provide system parameter types in custom `env`\n\nIn the previous version, we used the FRAME provided in the Europa project by default, and defined the data types of the following system-level variables:\n\n```typescript\ntype Hash Array<u8>(32);\ntype AccountId Array<u8>(32);\ntype BlockNumber UInt32;\ntype Balance UInt128;\n```\n\nAlthough the default data type can meet most of the needs, in order to meet a small number of custom requirements, we will provide developers with the ability about custom `Hash` `AccountId` `BlockNumber` `Balance` data type in the v0.3 to adapt to different FRAME.\n\n### 4. Unit Testing and Documentation\n\n* Provide unit testing of Preprocess and framework.\n* Provide tutorial documents for contract development.\n* Provide framework API documentation.\n\n## Detailed timeline v0.3  (3 developers * 10 weeks)\n\n1. Week 1~2: ask-cli\n\n  * Complete the architecture design and implementation of `ask-cli`.\n  * Implement `init`, `compile` functions.\n\n2. Week 3~6: Performance optimization work.\n\n  * Merge `@storage` to `@contract`:\n    * Expand the `@storage` logic in the implementation of contract to realize the read and write ability of state variables.\n    * Optimize the key generation logic when storing state variables.\n    * A new method is added to the implementation of contract to generate storage logic for state variables, ensuring that `seal_set_storage` is only called once.\n    * Add `@immediately` annotation, which acts on state variables, and the annotated variables will immediately call `seal_set_storage` to save.\n  * Enhance contract syntax.\n    * Standardize annotation usage, use JSON format instead of `()` method\n    * Enhance compile-time syntax checking, when encountering unsupported annotations and parameters, a compilation error will be thrown.\n    * Enhance `@event` class, optimize implementation method and support event inheritance.\n  * Optimize the size of the generated wasm file.\n  * Define the export format of Map and Array in metadata.json, and provide js parsing library.\n  * Upgrade the `seal_xxx` method to the latest stable version of pallet-contract.\n\n3. Week 7:\n\n  * Customize the `Hash` `AccountId` `BlockNumber` `Balance` data type in the env environment.\n  * Update the usage of predefined environment variables in the framework.\n\n4.

      "title": "Open-Source DApp API: Milestone 2",
      "content": "**tldr: Second of three milestones in which SubQuery and Fearless Wallet create an open source API that should be able to provide different types of applications with a sufficient (but read-only) view of all key data within the Kusama chain. E.g. a developer could use it to create their own chain explorer without needing to directly query chain data**\n\nWe believe that the DApps ecosystem will benefit from a common core API that each parachain can integrate (and extend) to index and expose their chain data for future consumer facing applications (e.g. a wallet, explorer, or other dApp). \n\nThere will be 3 individually proposed milestones delivering open source projects, packages, and associated learning material to help decentralised app developers start building applications on Polkadot/Kusama\n\n**Who**\n\nThis is a joint proposal between two parties - SubQuery/OnFinality and Fearless Wallet/SORAMITSU\n\n**What**\n1. Create an Open-Source SubQuery Project for Common Data\n2. Document and Publish Learning Material and Tutorials\n\n**Outcomes**\n1. Improve the Interoperability of DApps and Parachains\n2. Attract and Support More Developers in Kusama\n\n### Milestone 2\n\n**This proposal is for the 2nd milestone only.**\n\nImplement a SubQuery project that provides the data for the previously defined API spec for Kusama (from [milestone 1](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/95)).\n\nCurrent API Spec GitHub: [https://github.com/subquery/common-api-polkadot/blob/main/schema.graphql](https://github.com/subquery/common-api-polkadot/blob/main/schema.graphql)\nCurrent GraphDoc Preview: [https://subquery.github.io/common-api-polkadot/](https://github.com/subquery/common-api-polkadot/blob/main/schema.graphql)\n\nIt will be made open source (MIT license) on GitHub and uploaded to the SubQuery Explorer so it can be indexed and made available for all to query (for free).\n\nOur view is that this API should be able to provide applications with a sufficient (but read-only) view of all key data within the chain. E.g. a developer could use it to create their own chain explorer without needing to directly query chain data. One key thing to note with our core API interface is that the design should largely work across any parachain. We’ve written it with existing parachains like Karura and Moonriver in mind.\n\nYou’ll see that there are some open issues in the repository. These APIs are intended to be constantly iterated and improved over time (with considerations to backwards compatibility). We invite the Kusama community to provide feedback directly via GitHub in the form of issues and pull requests.\n\n[Please read full proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13L8HBwB6VB-n2g274FFFJKORYPJsq744C6H8iEDQ0-0/edit?usp=sharing)",
