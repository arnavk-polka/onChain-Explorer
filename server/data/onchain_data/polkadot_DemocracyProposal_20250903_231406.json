      "title": "Returning Supercolony lost funds back to the Treasury",
      "content": "# Context\nOver the past few months, there have been numerous discussions surrounding treasury spending, particularly concerning the return on investment (ROI) and the value generated from these expenditures. We recognize that these metrics can sometimes be subjective. However, we have identified a specific treasury allocation that was granted, marked as lost, and subsequently re-awarded by the Polkadot Council. \n\n# Initial Treasury Request\nFor clarity, this discussion is not related to the content of the proposal or the team receiving DOT but is solely focused on the funds marked as [\"lost”](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/152#d5254fb0-f5b5-48c3-a045-2c0e1b88da5a).\n\nIn February 2022, the Supercolony team requested 6,011 DOT ($128,000) to host an online event dedicated to Polkadot smart contracts called the \"WASM Conference.\" You can find the Council Motion and treasury proposal [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/152).\n\nIt is worth noting that the majority of the Supercolony team are from Ukraine, and in March 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine took place. Understandably, the Supercolony team had to leave their home country.\n\nThis situation led to treasury proposal 96, which can be viewed [here](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/proposal/96). The team stated that they lost access to the funds while leaving Ukraine. They then established a new account identity and were awarded an additional 6,011 DOT to host the WASM Conference.\n\n# Current Situation\nAn account containing approximately 6,000 DOT, awarded by the treasury and marked as \"lost,\" now exists. You can see the account [here](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/5HTb4Sr2kLAhhELhqGTsgvMb2xE1ByaSk4xbY8rwLF8XRuau?tab=transfer).\n\nThe Polkadot Council, and by extension our ecosystem's treasury, has paid twice for the same project (WASM Conference).\n\nThe team was re-awarded the necessary amount due to the political situation in Ukraine. The funds were allocated specifically for completing tasks outlined in their proposal and were granted twice.\n\nChaosDAO strongly believes that it is inappropriate to allow these DOTs to remain in this account as the team were reissued the original allocation of tokens subsequent to the first payment being lost.\n\nDue to the factors above, we are proposing the following extrinsic be initiated:\n\n* balances.ForceTransfer\n\nThis extrinsic will transfer 6,011 DOT from the lost Supercolony account to the Polkadot treasury.\n\nWe would like to remind the community that each referendum is unique and discrete in its scope, and every individual referendum should be evaluated on its own merits prior to voting. There should not be any precedent set by approving the aforementioned extrinsic. This should never be used as a basis for approving future uses of the balances.ForceTransfer extrinsic haphazardly. \n\nUltimately, we believe that the fate of these lost funds should be decided upon by the DOT token holder DAO, as they belong to the treasury. Whether the outcome of the decision is AYE or NAY, we believe that it is of the utmost importance that this decision be decided by the collective token holders, and not retroactively by the council with no community input.\n\nTo reiterate, this discussion is not about the Supercolony team or any specific individual; it is solely focused on addressing accounts claimed to be \"lost\" that have received treasury rewards.\n\n",

      "content": "As all but one of the council [chose to abstain](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/373) from voting to pass this proposal to a community vote - I'm now submitting this through democracy for the community to decide whether this proposal should be voted on by the community.\n\nSome of you might feel this proposal reaches outside of the normal scope the treasury - I would argue that, given this technology's stated aim to be decentralised and unstoppable, this is an existential question the community should decide.\n \nI would ask people to read the proposal and consider the impact voting for it would have for both`Polkadot and the people affected by this disaster. \n\n\n**Proponent: Simon Hipkins (Key Pictures)\n<br>Beneficiary: Ihtiyac haritası (NeedsMap.coop) 1haY6iHgLopw2WWmPhcdCy2jwzL2jthbNL515rUyJtnmhUt\n<br>Date: 20.03.2023\n<br>Requested DOT: 171333.51 (USD $1,081,000.00) Converted to DOT using the EMA7 rate on subscan on date of submission (20/03/2023)**\n\n**Summary:**\n<br>On February 6th, 2023, two earthquakes hit Pazarcik and Elbistan in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, leading to over 50,000 deaths and leaving 1.5 million people homeless. This was the deadliest earthquake worldwide since the 2010 Haiti earthquake. \n\nIt is also proving to be one of the first major examples of blockchains and their tokens being used to directly offer humanitarian assistance. \n<br>So far over $12.5 million in donations have been made from blockchain protocols, treasuries, exchanges and donors.\n\n**This proposal provides a tangible and transparent way for <u>the Polkadot community</u> to contribute to a long-term and a UNDP approved best practice project that will help people recover from this terrible disaster.**\n\nIhtiyacharitası (NeedsMap.coop) is one of Turkey's most reliable non-governmental organizations and has been at the forefront of search and rescue efforts in recent weeks. As UNDP co-lead for reconstruction efforts in the region they are now beginning to construct a series of villages built from repurposed shipping containers across the affected region. These villages will provide much needed housing, social and psychological care for those affected by the earthquake. They will also be a best practice model for other UN affiliated organizations and contractors building hundreds of such container villages across the region. \n\n<br>This proposal would allow the Polkadot community to build a neighbourhood in one of these villages. This neighbourhood would consist of around 100 containers (households) and house approximately 400 - 450 people over an area of 6900m2.\n\nAs it is usual for such temporary post-earthquake housing to be necessary for at least two years - this proposal also budgets to support the maintenance and social program for this neighbourhood for 24 months.\n\n**In effect we will be using DOT to give a two-year lifeline to hundreds of people to rebuild their lives and helping to define a best practice model for post-disaster housing.**\n\nPlease read the full proposal and budget [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/102KiQRMjDSemj8eSNCYJe8VSwOc_aMbqBU6mXbjJbms/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nAnd you can [listen to an interview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7oAbRKsvYmue2qJs7j_GFVOqWzXkZdx/view?usp=sharing) I made with [Esra Arslan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/esra-arslan-63088314/), co-founder of the beneficiary organisation NeedsMap and project lead for the container village in Hatay. During the interview I was able to ask her many of the questions raised over the last weeks.\n\nAnd you can view images of the current construction work [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18JkK3xWBmTYEN5DSSEg0eabyP_gfS-i0?usp=sharing). \n\n> \n**Beneficiary Identity**\n\nThe DOT Account of the Beneficiary, ‘Ihtiyaç haritası’ (NeedsMap) has been approved by ‘MASAK’ (The Turkish Financial Regulator). As part of the Turkish government regulations, NeedsMap (along with all NGOs in Turkey) were mandated to set-up their wallet addresses on Turkish exchanges, Paribu and BTCTurk. The ‘Ihtiyaç haritası’ (NeedsMap) wallet address has been opened on the local Turkish crypto-exchange, Paribu. \n\nAs the NeedsMap wallet address is on an exchange it is not possible for them to create an on-chain identity for the beneficiary account. In lieu of this on-chain identity, NeedsMap has publicly tweeted out the beneficiary address in the proposal - available to see here:\n\n[https://twitter.com/ihtiyacharitasi/status/1632116990390288391?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihtiyacharitasi/status/1632116990390288391?s=20)\n\nThis DOT address - can be verified to be the same on Paribu - the Turkish exchange - webpage here:\n\n[https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/about-our-disaster-support-plan-and-the-cryptocurrency-donation-system/](https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/about-our-disaster-support-plan-and-the-cryptocurrency-donation-system/)\n\nIf this proposal is successful, Paribu will hold NeedsMap’s DOT in account and convert it into Turkish Lira gradually so as not to affect the market value. \n\nIn accordance with the Turkish Regulator’s requirements, for every request NeedsMap makes for funds from their account at Paribu - they must supply an invoice - e.g. for the purchase of 100 containers. All these invoices will be made available to the DOT community as part of the reporting process on the project (see milestones) to ensure full transparency that the DOT contributed is being used to pay for the project.\n\n<i>All of NeedsMap’s transactions regarding support they receive are audited on a daily basis by Mazars, an independent audit, tax and accounting company. In addition, every spend from their DOT beneficiary address will be invoiced for, and these invoices will be made available to the Polkadot community in 3 milestone reports over the duration of the project.</i>\n\n",

      "content": "To help make validating on Polkadot more accessible the following proposal aims to increase the maximum number of active validators per era from 297 to 500. Currently validators require having at least ~1.663.500 DOT in nominations in order to have a chance at becoming an active validator. This has created a challenge for independent decentralized validators to get into the active set, even when getting support from the thousand validator programme. Increasing the maximum number of active validators per set should help make validating on Polkadot more open to individuals, and lower the nomination target barrier. !\\[\\](https://i.imgur.com/ymepSVw.png) !\\[\\](https://i.imgur.com/Kula6ci.png) preimage hash: 0x8a9858782be312ee01e3c12adcbda468f8b8dc46a1e5f5cb029e0ce231ebd705 Encoded call: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x0709d107",

      "content": "### The Kapex Parachain has been producing blocks since winning and parachain slot on Polkadot, but cannot be upgraded due to an error.\n\n> [SRLabs](https://www.srlabs.de/) conducted a security audit on the Totem Kapex pallets and identified an issue with some illegal code that impacted the Transaction Payment pallet adapted by the team. Unfortunately the team won a slot on Polkadot before the audit could have been conducted and so the issue was not discovered until the audit completed. \n\n## Background\nThe standard Transaction Payment Pallet had been forked and adapted to record transaction fees into the accounting engine of the KAPEX Parachain. the original version of this code was changed by a new team developer to use a function reserved for off-chain workers instead of the original code but as the code compiled it was not spotted until the audit. It was thought that an upgrade would fix the issue.\n\n## Upgrade failure\nAs the Transaction Payment Pallet is called during an upgrade to reserve funds (even though the actual upgrade is free of charge), the illegal code was unfortunately also called to record this reservation of fees causing an error, preventing the upgrade from taking place and therefore not allowing the parachain to be fixed.\n\n**_In addition this also meant that the XCM security vulnerability discovered in late September also cannot be fixed either at this point._**\n\nAll attempts were made to try to fix this issue without having to go to the Council and Referendum process, with help provided with gratitude from the Kilt.io team and Parity team Bastian, Alejandro and Santiago.\n\nThe new [Manual Parachain Lock](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5451) cannot fix our chain because [the unlocking mechanism does not allow for centrally controlled chains to unlock the parachain from the relaychain side](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/6196). \n\nThe fix that worked was to apply a validation code substitution using `paras.forceSetCurrentCode()` executed on the relaychain once the parachain `chain spec` had been updated accordingly and applied to the collators in our test networks. This is the subject of this proposal.\n\n## Testing the fix\n\n- [X] Tested the fix (`paras.forceSetCurrentCode()`) on our [Relaychain development network](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frelaychain.totem.live#/parachains) connected to the Lego development parachain.\n\n- [X] Upgraded the Lego Parachain to version [`v1.2.0`](https://github.com/totem-tech/totem-parachains/tree/kapex-v1.2.0-audit-fix) \n\n- [X] Upgrade Lego to [`v1.3.0`](https://github.com/totem-tech/totem-parachains/tree/kapex-v1.3.0-polkadot-v0.9.28-alignment)\n\n- [X] Tested the fix on the [Rococo chain](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frococo-rpc.polkadot.io#/accounts) connected to our [Stagex](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fs-ui.kapex.network#/explorer) production staging parachain with the help of Parity devs.\n\n- [X] Upgraded the Stagex Parachain to version `v1.2.0`\n\n- [X] Then upgrade Stagex to `v1.3.0`\n\n- [X] Upgraded [docker Stagex nodes](https://hub.docker.com/layers/totemlive/totem-parachain-collator/staging/images/sha256-bc6fe0e61a347e2f64150aa2fd739bb5e0b12b0702c1b8a4f7da262b39328897?context=explore) to run version `v1.3.0`\n\n## Production preparation\n- [X] Decide the block number for the transition in Kapex [chainspec](https://github.com/totem-tech/totem-parachains/blob/main/res/kapex/kapex-parachain-raw.json) - Block number `400000`\n\n- [X] Apply the [new production validation code](https://github.com/totem-tech/totem-parachains/blob/main/res/parachain-code-substitution-wasm.wasm) to Kapex `chainspec`\n\n- [X] Tag the code repo from the main branch in the repo as [`kapex-v1.1.0-codeSub`](https://github.com/totem-tech/totem-parachains/releases/tag/kapex-v1.1.0-codeSub)\n\n- [X] Build a new [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/totemlive/totem-parachain-collator/production/images/sha256-21857f3efd8496a57bd41646d728086173b622ac085f5204f48a015dd9e02310?context=explore) with the new Kapex `chainspec`.\n\n- [X] Restart the Kapex Collators with the new `chainspec`.\n\n- [X] Transfer funds to request code Substitution on Polkadot\n\n- [X] Create Preimage hash on Polkadot `0x1ca2532cbb04d421f1b216f354354524feffd8540e7ca74b0938e58d2cdfc923` \n\n- [X] Create a proposal\n\n- [X] Create Preimage on Polkadot\n\nWe are unfortunately unable to distribute our funds from the Crowdloan until this issue is fixed, so we look forward to the community supporting this proposal through the referendum as soon as possible. Thanks in advance.\n\nThe Totem Kapex Team",

      "title": "Lawyer to Verify Legal Names",
      "content": "Hello. My name is Jonathan Kleiman. I am a Polkadot ambassador candidate, and I have been a lawyer in Toronto for 10 years. I am licensed by the Law Society of Ontario. You can find my website at www.jkleiman.com, and you can peruse my google reviews [here](https://g.page/kleimanlaw?share). \n\nAs a lawyer, I am licensed to verify documents as a notary. My intention is to verify legal name identities on-chain using this same process. Specifically, I will require two pieces of photo ID, and a short video call to confirm that the person seeking identification is indeed the person on the ID's provided. \n\nThe video call (no, a screenshot - see edit) will be recorded for verification records, but will not be shared without requestor's consent or a court order, if for some reason the requestor needs to prove that their identity was properly verified.\n\nAs a lawyer, the risk to me of publicly confirming somebody's identity incorrectly is very serious, as the public would be assured of the reliability of such verification and would be able to rely upon it as if it were notarized by me. For this reason, verifications performed by me will be completely trustworthy, without question.\n\nI plan to charge 5 DOT (3 DOT, see edit) for the verification services. Any voters for this proposal when it reaches referendum will receive their verification for free by fee refund once the proposal is approved (unless this is disallowed)\n\nPlease feel free to send any questions or suggestions to me at [Jonathan@JKleiman.com](mailto:jonathan@jkleiman.com)\n\n[Proof of License](https://lso.ca/public-resources/finding-a-lawyer-or-paralegal/directory-search/members/lawyer/049/jonathan-louis-kleiman)\n\nEDITS: \n\n1) I am lowering the price to 3 DOT, given the recent and anticipated price appreciation\n\n2) Pursuant to comments, I suggest that no video be recorded, but that a screenshot of the video be taken and held on offline storage.\n\n3) I will offer to verify email, twitter, and element name as well.\n\n4) Non-english identification can be done, but must involve a lawyer licensed to practice in the jurisdiction that the account holder resides, who can certify the identity for the Registrar.\n\n5) In the event that there are too many for one person to handle, additional lawyers can be involved to verify identities, but the main registrar would still be responsible to ensure the process is secure and reliable. This practice is acceptable to my law society as well - I am allowed to rely on the certification of a person's identity as long as it is done by a lawyer in their jurisdiction, and I am able to confirm the lawyer's identity and their license to practice law, and receive ID of the account holder.\n\n6) Thank you to those who have participated in the discussion, and those who have foregone staking rewards by seconding my proposal.\n",
