      "title": "Polkadot Community Foundation - Community Directors Election and Removal Process",
      "content": "**Polkadot Community Foundation Directors**\n\n**1. Context and Purpose**\nThe Bylaws of the Polkadot Community Foundation (PCF) establish a five-member board of directors. Three of these directors, named PCF Foundation Directors, were chosen by the Foundation as per the approved Opengov proposal and are required to be residents of the Cayman Islands. The remaining two positions, named PCF Community Directors, are vacant and are designated for directors elected by the community, tasked with acting as a direct link between the Polkadot Community and the Foundation.\n\nThis proposal aims to define a clear and functional framework for the nomination of these two PCF Community Directors, their role, and the procedures for their removal, ensuring the process is transparent and unambiguous.\n\n**2. Role of PCF Community Directors**\nThe two directors operate at the service of the community as facilitators. Their main responsibilities include:\n\nCommunication Bridge: Acting as the main point of contact between the community and the PCF, ensuring a clear, bidirectional flow of information.\n\nProposal Guidance: Supporting the community in preparing Proposals that require PCF involvement, ensuring compliance with PCF and OpenGov procedures.\n\nExecution Oversight: Monitoring the progress of approved Proposals and ensuring the PCF executes them promptly.\n\n**3. Code of Conduct**\nDirectors must adhere to a code of conduct based on Web3 values, acting with:\n\n**Transparency:** Directors commit to open operations and regular updates. They will share all information with the community (if requested), except for confidential data protected by NDAs.\n\n**Neutrality:** Directors must act without personal bias, favoritism towards specific projects, or influence from any single entity. Their decisions will be based solely on what benefits the entire Polkadot ecosystem and in accordance with the indications contained in the approved OpenGov proposals.\n\n**Integrity:** Directors will act with honesty, ethics, and a high degree of responsibility. They must avoid any conflicts of interest and commit to making decisions that are always in the best interest of the Polkadot Community and its stakeholders.\n\n**4. Appointment Process**\nCandidates can run for a position one at a time.\n\nCandidacy: Nominations must be submitted via a “Proposal Wish for Change”.\n\nProcess: Any individual may run for one of the two available positions.\n\nRequirements: Candidates should have a deep understanding of the ecosystem, a clear commitment to the role and, preferably, a minimal managerial experience.\n\nManagement of Competing Proposals: A proposal to fill a vacant director position can only be executed if that position is currently empty. The first proposal to be approved by the community via OpenGov will fill the vacant spot. Any subsequent proposals for that specific position will not be executed unless the position becomes vacant again.\n\n**5. Removal Process**\nThe removal of a director can be proposed by any Tokenholder via a “Proposal Wish for Change”, with a detailed justification.\n\nContinued Operation: If one of the two directors is removed, the remaining director will continue to operate alone.\n\nVote: The removal is effective only after it has been approved by the community via OpenGov.\n\nRe-election: In the event of a removal, the opportunity for a new nomination process for the single vacant position will be opened for candidates to initiate.\n\n_The rapid election of these two directors is fundamental to honor the community’s decision and ensure effective communication with the PCF, preventing the problems encountered in the past._\n\nResources:\n[https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/proposals/820](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/proposals/820)\n[https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1591](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1591)\n[https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/pcf/](https://wiki.polkadot.com/general/pcf/)",

It is unclear how much additional demand the psychological effect of a supply cap can create and is a purely speculative bet. Too risky for a multi-billion dollar asset.\n\n## Tokenomics policy needs to create demand for DOT\nThe main problem with current tokenomics is not they are creating too much supply, it is that they are creating too little demand. There is no incentive to use DOT in parachains. Even worse, there is a disincentive, because the staking APR is too damn high. Even an inflation halving will not eliminate this problem.\n\nThe primary driver of DOT demand can only come from the economy. In Polkadot, parachains are the economy. Right now, only 0.7% of DOT are used on parachains for economic activity. 54% are staked. 45% are idle. The DOT economy is practically non-existent.\n\nGood DOT tokenomics has to answer the question: How do we create demand for DOT?\n\nTo create DOT demand, it is not enough to just sharpen the supply curve. We need to actively create demand drivers. For this, we need policy levers. The \"Growth Incentives\" pool is such a policy lever.\n\n![image (40).png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUSb5NVneDSZfaFxNcwj2apzKCKbTcUrZMxuygRhYQkmg)\n\n## Creating an Economic Growth Incentive Pool\nThe idea of introducing a buffer fund that captures unused inflation for economic policy was recently discussed by Gavin Wood at the Web3 Summit 2025: [Closing Keynote Day 1 - Gavin Wood - Web3 Summit 2025 @ 41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV1QP8cJh74&t=2486s) \n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdQuWg9adZCFnqebnFmGNq3gnfNM8NBrAMM2FjJUUgirH)\n\nThis proposal suggests to introduce such a mechanism: an account that receives a variable share of the inflation that neither goes to stakers nor the Treasury. Governance can control how many staking rewards are distributed and direct any excess amounts to the buffer fund.\n\nThe buffer fund shall be used through algorithmic mechanisms to stimulate economic growth or be directed back to staking rewards when needed. By introducing a growth incentive pool that can only be distributed indirectly and algorithmically and not through direct OpenGov decisions, we retain an important economic policy lever.\n\nCurrently, inflation in Polkadot is distributed as follows:\n- 85% staking rewards\n- 15% Treasury income\n\nBy introducing a new account and an additional variable under control of OpenGov, the distribution can now be changed, such that for example:\n- 64% staking rewards\n- 15% Treasury income\n- 21% buffer fund\n\nThe initial distribution share proposed in the remark of this proposal is illustrated below:\n![Frame 16 (2).png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYjbqLaNFLQ6CkxcKpVjsJ7SoeuUoaatr6RH7rc42Y9h2)\n\nThis distribution share would in the first year effectively cut staking rewards in half (102m->51m DOT), remove 1/3 from the Treasury (18m->12m DOT), and set up the new Growth Incentives Pool with 17m DOT per year.\n\nThe share distribution could be configurable, so that it can be adapted by future governance decisions.\n\n### Example mechanisms\nThe distribution mechanism itself is not part of the proposal. But for a better understanding of what could be done algorithmically I share two existing ideas: Economic Growth Incentives and Optimistic Project Funding.\n\nI have laid out one algorithmic mechanism in the forum post [Economic Growth Incentives](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/economic-growth-incentives/14300). There I argue that we can algorithmically allocate DOT to parachains in proportion to how much each parachain sovereign account has captured in non-staked DOT. This creates a virtouous cycle of economic growth, letting parachains compete for DOT incentives, forcing innovation and a race to capture DOT. It also eliminates the disincentive for DeFi to capture hundreds of millions of USD in DOT. The effect is that hundreds of millions of USD worth of DOT gets pulled into the economy and sets the ecosystem on a new growth trajectory.\n\nEconomic Growth Incentives is also described in a video here:\n[Video: Economic Growth Incentives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ5Gn4wXzY0)\n\nAnother potential model is [Optimistic Project Funding](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/712), which received 55m AYes on the WFC track.\n\n## Include the pool in the tokenomics decision now to secure this important economic policy lever\n\nI strongly believe we must not rush decisions that affects billions of USD of market cap. We need to determine the exact model through calm and logical economic research led by the resources and personnel currently only available to the W3F.\n\nRef [1710](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1710) is way too harsh by reducing inflation by 54%. It would reduce staking rewards to 47m DOT and Treasury income to 8m DOT. After this reduction, there will  be no more room to accumulate funds for the buffer fund until the ideas suggested by Gavin Wood would be implemented, which currently has an inderminate timeline.\n\nWe need to act on economic growth now. We have the tools to introduce the pool at hand, so we should not wait.\n\n**It is important that we do not lock us out of incentivicing economic growth by hammering down inflation without any room to move policy levers. If a hard staking reward reduction is enacted, we must also set aside DOT to the economic growth incentive pool.**\n\nThe current proposal maintains all the benefits of 1710 (supply cap + staking rewards halving) but mitigates the risk of not being able to counter a deadly downward spiral.\n\nIf we will not find agreement on the mechanism, we can still discard the idea and burn the incentive pool later.",

      "title": "[WFC] OpenGov Adjustments - 2025",
      "content": "**OpenGov Adjustments - 2025**\n\n_A Polkadot Ecosystem Agents™ Initiative_\n\nWe are proposing adjustments to OpenGov in retrospect of the community's engagement over the last 24 months of proposals, voting and dialog. \nThis proposal seeks to decrease noise for voters and increase accountability of proponents. \n\nThe adjustments are conceptually part of a broader framework and vision for the future of OpenGov - we see the long term vision of the treasury transforming by moving the majority of spending to bounties, or collectives which allow for better domain knowledge, scope, and cost negotiation. The long term vision also includes agreed-upon budgeting per domain area, greater transparency across bounty spending, and enhanced controls for managing and promoting competent talent within the ecosystem inside the bounty system.\n\n**This Wish For Change (WFC) seeks to align the community on a series of short term adjustments and the long term vision.**\n\nThe short term adjustments revolve around increasing the quality of submissions and reducing the noise and effort that is required from governance participants. We see this as a large time and brain drain from the ecosystem with a huge opportunity cost for those actively involved. \n\nThe short term adjustments involve, per track:\n- **Increasing** the **Submission Deposit** from 1 DOT to 10 DOT\n- **Increasing** **Decision Deposit**\n- **Increasing** the minimum **Support Turn-out** \n- **Decreasing** the **Max Deciding** referendum \n- (number of active referendum allowed per track) \n- Making the **Referendum Canceller** easier to submit\n- Decreasing the **Decision Time** (Undeciding Timeout)\n\nThe **Submission Deposit** has been increased to help reduce spam proposals or “just vote nay” (submission errors). Any submission deposits on failed proposals result in this DOT being locked forever and unable to be claimed (effectively burnt). The aim of increasing this to 10 DOT should help prospective proponents to take more care when raising governance proposals.  \n\nIncreasing the **Decision Deposit** should force proponents requesting funds to have a greater stake in the ecosystem and network or may require proponents to seek an aligned sponsor for large spends if they are coming from outside of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nIncreasing the minimum **Support Turn-Out** will help ensure that only well aligned proposals that really engage the community make it through and are funded / approved.\n\nDecreasing the **Max Deciding** will increase efficiency of spending, help reduce noise for involved parties, and therefore decrease voting fatigue. This proposal decreases the maximum possible active governance proposals across four tracks from 160 down to 15. Similar to Gov 1, this can lead to a queue of waiting proposals and the proposal with the most support in the queue will become active (go into voting) next. This helps increase the quality of proposals and slows down OpenGov, allowing participants to focus on proposals and have a more robust discussion period before and during active voting. \n\nMaking **Referendum Canceller** cheaper to submit ensures that if there are active proposals which are very likely to fail - e.g. 90% NAY with a strong support, then these proposals can be cancelled to clear up the active spots, allowing another proposal to be voted on, without having to wait the full voting duration. \n\nDecreasing the Decision Time will help remove spam / low quality proposals. This is planned to be decreased from 14 days to 3 days across ALL tracks. This is the time limit available to place the decision deposit. \n\nThese adjustments have all been modeled against previous OpenGov proposals to ensure that high quality proposals will still pass with these new adjustments.\n\nThe following tracks are included in the proposed short term adjustments:\n- Treasurer\n- Small spender\n- Medium spender\n- Big spender\n- Referendum canceller\n\nThese tracks account for 60% of all treasury proposals raised since OpenGov’s launch. These adjustments have been [tracked in the following document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1agMkQ9Q8-ZwYYc7HK-XSmqG4S0Y2_c9Jjzsol2tBYeQ/edit?usp=sharing) and are as follows:\n\n**Treasurer**\n- Max deciding, decreased from 10 to 2\n- Decision Deposit, increased from 1,000 to 25,000 DOT\n- Min Support Turn Out increased from 0% to 1%\n\n\n**Small spender**\n- Max deciding decreased from 50 to 5\n- Decision deposit increased from 100 to 500 DOT\n- Min Support Turn Out increased from 0% to 0.5%\n\n\n**Medium spender**\n- Max deciding decreased from 50 to 5\n- Decision deposit increase from 200 to 1,000\n- Min Support Turn Out increased from 0% to 0.5%\n\n\n**Big Spender**\n- Max deciding decreased from 50 to 3\n- Decision deposit increase from 400 to 5,000\n- Min Support Turn Out increased from 0% to 0.75%\n\n\n**Referendum Canceller**\n- Max deciding decreased from 1,000 to 500\n- Decision deposit decreased from 10,000 to 5,000\n\nThese proposed adjustments to OpenGov represent an evolution in how we use the Polkadot treasury.\nBy reducing the amount of incoming treasury proposals we will have more time to evaluate the proposals that go through, increasing the quality of our decision making.\nBy raising deposits, tightening active proposal limits, and optimising cancellation mechanics, these changes are designed to elevate the quality of governance activity and increase alignment within the network participants, while minimizing the time and energy drain on participants.\nThis WFC marks a clear step toward a more focused, sustainable, and scalable OpenGov for all. \n\nOriginally discussed on the forum: \nhttps://forum.polkadot.network/t/opengov-adjustments-2025/14295?u=birdo",

      "content": "As specified in the remark, this WFC requests that the Web3 Foundation begin a Polkadot Agents Program, with a goal of providing rapid support and reimbursement directly from Web3 Foundation to members helping to grow and support the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nThe on-chain remark is as follows.\n\n---\n\n\nSummary:\n\nWe propose that the Web3 Foundation create the new Polkadot Agents Program. An initiative grounded in the core values Polkadot stands for, with a flexible and resilient structure. It will be coordinated by the Foundation, while giving significant responsibility and ownership to its members in a fair and healthy way. Contributions to the ecosystem will not be rewarded with salaries, but through shared experiences and meaningful activities that bring members together.\n\nProblem:\n\nThe community has shown incredible passion and energy, but it's clear that things haven't always been easy. It has often been difficult for people to contribute in a meaningful way. Now, as Polkadot reaches a key moment in its journey, we have the opportunity to build something solid, professional, and truly inspiring — a structure that not only supports real contributors but also promotes accountability, professionalism, and long-term impact around a shared vision.\n\nProposal:\n\nThe Web3 Foundation will coordinate a fully voluntary Polkadot Agents Program based on the following principles:\n\nA clear structure of roles. A track-based system (for example, Content, Events, Speakers, Developers, etc.). Quick and transparent reimbursement process for operational expenses (e.g., travel and participation in key events). Focus on impactful expenditures that deliver value to the ecosystem.(e.g., technical workshops, dev onboarding, strategic content) Defined KPIs, onboarding processes, and internal reporting. Respect for a code of conduct and a strong sense of professionalism will be essential. We want to build a community of people who act with integrity, take their role seriously, and represent Polkadot with pride and responsibility. No salaries. Contributors may be rewarded through recognition, NFTs, and access to exclusive events and trainings. Future evolution toward decentralization with quality metrics in place.\n\nGoal:\n\nImprove the impact of Polkadot's community engagement efforts by allowing rapid fund deployment, ensuring a high standard of contribution, fostering regional leadership, and creating an accessible yet professional entry point into the ecosystem.\n\nNext:\n\nThe Web3 Foundation is preparing for the full rollout of the Polkadot Agents program, which is scheduled to launch in September.",

      "title": "Rebrand $DOT to $JAM in 2026",
      "content": "## Summary\n\nWe propose initiating a community-wide process to rebrand the $DOT to $JAM by the end of 2026. This rebrand reflects an evolution from Polkadot Relay Chain _securing app-chains_ with $DOT to the JAM Chain  becoming the premier platform for **trustless supercomputing**, powered by the JAM token.\n\nThe identity of $JAM is aligned with the next phase of growth—one rooted in new JAM Services CoreChains, CoreVM, and CorePlay. It positions JAM as a fourth-generation blockchain protocol eponymous with its primary chain name (the JAM Chain) and JAM token, ready to lead in scalable composable trustless supercomputing.\n\n## Rationale\nSince its inception, $DOT has been the foundational utility token of Polkadot, underpinning staking, governance, and securing parachains. But the protocol has evolved. Going forward:\n\n* CoreTime is the primary product\n* CoreChains is just one of several JAM Services, the one securing parachains\n*  Massive community efforts in Summer/Fall 2025 are moving staking, governance, balances into Asset Hub\n\nThe combination of the above enable a complete replacement of the Polkadot Relay Chain with the JAM Chain.  \n\nThe endpoint is that the JAM Chain is no longer _just_ a rollup host for parachains but a complete trustless supercomputing platform:\n* CoreChains secures rollups, the \"old\" sole function of Polkadot\n* CoreVM is trustless execution of arbitrary programs\n* CorePlay is trustless execution of actor-based programs TBD\n\nCoupled with JAM brand is the use of \"cores\", which are abstract units of computation central to JAM's architecture All are backed by the same TB-scale data availability layer. JAM's primary product is CoreTime, which would be purchased with $JAM tokens (rather than $DOT).\n\nThe name DOT is historically tied to securing app-chains/rollups/parachains. But DOT no longer captures the full scope of JAM protocol’s ambitions and is too associated with parachains. DOT is so closely tied to \"parachains\" that its continued use for JAM new capabilities may be seen as a liability and may hamper JAM's ability to have a new generation of CoreVM+Coreplay developers.\n\nBy contrast, the name JAM evokes movement, creativity, and (semi-)coherence—apt metaphors for a platform built to orchestrate computation across many JAM cores. JAM Cores can be used to not just secure rollups, but to run arbitrary programs, making a truly trustless supercomputer.\n\nHaving a $DOT rebrand to $JAM reduces the psychological barrier of DOT being  solely associated with _parachains_ and instead supports new psychological framing around _trustless supercomputing_.\n\nIt is believed this transformation can **accelerate** JAM service usage with a new generation of developers not only to secure app-chains but also to build CoreVM + CorePlay applications. It is expected the complexity of building CoreVM + CorePlay applications will be massively lower than that of parachains, expanding the demand for CoreTime significantly, paid for with the $JAM token.\n\n## Goals\n* Unify JAM branding: JAM as the trustless supercomputing protocol, the $JAM token and the JAM chain.\n* Position JAM evolution to appeal to private enterprises, institutions building fourth-generation secure scalable decentralized applications.\n* Lay the groundwork for messaging around JAM-native services—CoreChains, CoreVM, CorePlay—and create new sources of demand for Coretime and thus the JAM token\n\n## Scope\nThis Wish for Change opens an ecosystem-wide discussion on the feasibility and roadmap for:\n* Renaming $DOT to $JAM across CEXes/DEXes, wallets, documentation, explorers, and marketing channels.\n* Engaging CEXs, parachain teams, wallets, indexers, marketing teams to coordinate the transition in 2026.\n\nThis proposal does **not** mandate an immediate change nor have any tokenonomics changes, but initiates preparation for community consensus and execution by the end of 2026.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\nRebranding a well-established identity like Polkadot is a serious undertaking, which will be expected to supported by many OpenGov proposals. This should be taken into consideration by OpenGov voters. From x.com/polkadot and polkadot.com, to global marketing partnerships (e.g. Inter Miami FC), Polkadot has years of ecosystem investment in the $DOT brand.  Most ecosystem participants have a deep emotional attachment to the Polkadot brand and will be hesistant to start afresh and consider these investments <ins>sunk costs</ins>.\n\nBut the future is JAM.  And what we need is <ins>growth</ins> from <ins>new</ins> ecosystem participants.  We cannot stagnate just because of these sunk costs.\n\nA _coordinated_ rebrand signals confidence and clarity to the outside world: the Polkadot Relay Chain is now the JAM chain, the DOT token is now JAM, and the JAM protocol will lead us into the age of scalable composable trustless supercomputing.  \n\nCertain naming changes naturally follow:\n* Polkadot Relay Chain → JAM Chain\n* $DOT → $JAM across CEXes, CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, ...\n* Polkadot Cloud/Hub → JAM Cloud/Hub\n* Migration of polkadot domain names to JAM-branded equivalents\n* New messaging: “Secured by JAM” replaces “Secured by Polkadot”\n* Polkadot Blockchain Academy, Ambassadors, Events → JAM equivalents\n* Events like Sub0 / Decoded become JAM-branded showcases\n* ... and more decided by the DOT=>JAM community!\n\n## Timing\nA rebrand is difficult to coordinate all in one day, but coordinated milestones can guide rollout among dozens of stakeholders:\n* This Wish for Change passes and discussion begins\n* The JAM 1.0 protocol is ratified by the Fellowship\n* The JAM Toaster successfully tests CoreChains and associated services\n*  The Polkadot Relay Chain transitions to JAM Chain\n* ... and more decided by the DOT=>JAM community!\n\nBased on current development trajectories, these milestones are expected to converge by mid-2026.\n\n## Next Steps\nWe invite all stakeholders—token holders, developers, parachain teams, ecosystem contributors, and governance participants—to engage in discussion here. Even if you do not agree with rebranding $DOT to $JAM, your opinion on how both brands can be managed will help the community decide how to move forward.\n\nLet’s embrace a JAM-centric brand that reflects what Polkadot is destined to become:\n\n> The dominant protocol for trustless supercomputing: the JAM protocol\n> The dominant token for trustless supercomputing: the $JAM token \n> The dominant chain for trustless supercomputing: the JAM Chain\n\n# Let’s JAM!",

      "title": "Polkadot Community Foundation: Polkadot Payment Card",
      "content": "**Polkadot Community Foundation: Polkadot Payment Card**\n\n![](https://iili.io/FKf2SDJ.png)\n\nProponent: Autonomous Projects (16MVQPFt325pJ74bYpCGUWjyANFDZFZP3efYyV6XReAd1Sq1)\n\n\n**Top Line**\n\nThis proposal seeks to ratify the alignment from the Polkadot community to launch a “Polkadot” branded payment card for our ecosystem. \n\nThe card will be a non custodial payment card and will be able to be issued globally, and work anywhere in the world Visa is accepted. \n\nThe card will work with Apple Pay and Google Pay from day one and cost no fees to hold or fund the card other than gas. Users will pay a small usage fee (under 1%) when making transactions. \n\nThere is no cost to the Polkadot Treasury for the origination, set up and integration of this card program. All integration work in the Polkadot App will be covered by Ref #1573.\n\nThe launch of the payment card is subject to contractual and legal review.\n\n**Details**\n\nThe Polkadot payment card will offer a seamless way to bridge the gap between digital assets in the Polkadot ecosystem and everyday spending. This payment card will greatly improve the offramping experience and increase the useability of the Polkadot ecosystem for payments and DEFI.\n \nThe Polkadot payment card also will provide users with greater financial flexibility and control over their money. As the Polkadot App builds out its feature set over the next 6 months, by adding the payment card, we see the functionality providing an alternative to traditional banking, especially for individuals already receiving an income in stablecoins.\n\nThe two main considerations for the payment card are:\n\n- A non custodial payment card - users should never have to lose custody for basic spending \n- Global issuance - almost anyone in the world should be able to register for the card inside their wallet or application. \n\n\nAfter detailed research and due diligence spanning over several months, the PCF has selected Baanx as the card provider and issuer as they can offer an excellent experience with a non custodial card, and have global issuance. Baanx has very successfully launched cards for Metamask, Ledger, 1inch and World. They are very connected with Visa and Mastercard teams and are principal members of both the Visa and Mastercard programs through their parent company.\n \nThis payment card program would be managed by CL, a brand of Baanx. The Polkadot Community Foundation (PCF) will refer users to CL through the Polkadot Mobile App (https://polkadot.com/app), and will drive the initial integration, adoption and usage of the payment card. \n\nThis proposal seeks to gain community support for the following:\n\n- The Polkadot Community Foundation to work with Baanx to set up and manage a payment card program\n- Negotiating and signing any contractuals with Baanx or other companies required to launch the payment card \n- Co-ordination of any marketing or incentives programs to increase visibility of Polkadot and / or the card program.\n\n**Card Program**\n\nThe payment card will be a debit card, using the Visa rails and will be Polkadot x Visa branded. The card will carry no other branding.\n\nThe card will be powered by solidity smart contracts using account abstraction and will allow users to hold and pay with USDC which is pre-authorised for spending using account abstraction. Other supported assets are planned to be added in the future.\n\nThe vast majority of other crypto payment cards on the market are custodial cards, meaning you have to “top up” your account which moves funds out of your wallet / your control, this massively increases the risk of loss of funds.\n\nThe payment card will allow payments made at any location that Visa is accepted, where the user pays a small fee (between 0.4% and 0.8% of the value of the transaction) for the payment. This fee will be country and currency dependent and is driven by Baanx. This covers all Baanx and Visa costs including the crypto to fiat offramping and merchant reconciliation. Any remaining funds left over after costs will be split 50/50 between the PCF and Baanx.\n\nThe user pays no monthly account fees, minimum fees or any other fees associated with having or managing the card. There is no fee (other than a gas fee) to approve the spending of funds for the card.\n \nThe card program will launch with a virtual payment card which works fully with Apple Pay or Google pay and in the future.\n\nThe payment card issued by CL via Baanx is a regulated product and subject to jurisdictional approval and standard OFAC Regulations globally. Each user who wishes to order a card will request it via an onboarding flow including industry standard KYC and AML review prior to issuance in their country of citizenship. Approval requirements vary by geography. \n\n**DAO Costs**\n\nThere will be no cost to the Polkadot Treasury for the origination and setup of this card program. As per the relationship between Baanx and the PCF, there will also be no long term or ongoing maintenance cost. Baanx will be the ongoing and exclusive provider for the contract term (3 years).\nAny ongoing relationship management costs are built into funding provided for Autonomous Projects managing the PCF. \nOnce launched the PCF may seek treasury funds for promoting the card program or offering incentives, for example: further cashback on the payment card, subsidising payment fees, or paying physical card costs.  \n\n**Roadmap**\n\nAssuming the governance proposal is a success then the PCF and Baanx will work through the following items:\n\n- Baanx has already provided the PCF with a letter of intent to proceed with the commercial contract \n- Baanx and PCF to finalise the full contract within one month of signing the letter of intent\n- Baanx to deploy their smart contracts to a Polkadot testnet\n- The Polkadot Community Foundation will integrate the registration and card management flows\n- End to end testing\n- Production deployment and further testing\n- Launch ✨\n\nWe believe that upon the governance proposal passing community voting, we will be able to launch the card for the first round of VIP users in 6-12 weeks. \n\nFull public launch will take place in the coming weeks afterwards, assuming there are no issues or delays with the deployment.\n \nThe card launch is also great timing to expand the Polkadot App from being USA only to covering other countries like the United Kingdom and Europe more broadly. \n\n\n",

      "content": "Just information: **We have seized the 200,000 DOT since parallel finance submit a technically flawed whitelist referenda - 1445.**\nhttps://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/24903231-9\n\nIt was quite a shock for us to discover that a staking project was so unfamiliar with the Polkadot staking mechanism.\n\nAnd update about Parallel Finance news:\n\n[In their medium](https://parallelfinance.medium.com/rebuilding-after-the-parachain-attack-a-message-to-our-community-9dccd6c2a080) Parallel Finance decide to not return all cDot to users. They will \"... open swap pairs for cDOT/PARA and cDOT/DOT. That said, we can't guarantee the conversion price, but we will do our best to provide liquidity for you...\"\n\n[Twitter On 2025/2/25](https://x.com/ParallelFi/status/1894384224192393569), Parallel Finance recently decided to change its CEO to Tom Tou.\n\n[Twitter On 2025/2/22](https://x.com/ParallelFi/status/1893205851986637228), Parallel Finance recently decided to shut down its main service in under five months by 2025/8/1 (you sure you can recover by Aug?)\n\nNo comment. Desperate move.\n\nYet Yubo has made some progress in clearing evidence on-chain (**The pending execution of referenda 1424 will reset Polkadot relayer chain's track on parallel finance blockchain history, meaning Parallel Finance can start a new chain and discarding all criminal history footprints if no one keep old data**). \n\nSo we encourage the community to retain the existing on-chain evidence, including old Parallel Finance datasets. From a purely technical standpoint, the evidence is solid and easy to verify both on-chain and off-chain, as demonstrated in the [last referenda we presented](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1326). \n\nYou may not trust our reputation, but should respect blockchain immutability.\n\nIt is important to note that the project's actions not only involve improper usage/theft of user funds but also involve relatively smaller amount/direct theft connected to Yubo personally. (see [referenda 1326](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1326), point 3) \nIt should be impossible for Yubo to evade personal responsibility, unless 2M DOT  returned to Parallel Finance user, just from lawsuit perspective.\n\nWe strongly advise the community to report this issue to the project’s main investors, which could bring significant legal attention and the potential for a serious lawsuit.\nHere: https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parallel-finance/financial_details\n\n\nBack to title\nWe do not blame Polkadot tech-fellows to pass the whitelist referenda 1445. Their purpose is good. (Although it did break our heart... Twice)\nHowever, given the success of our taking-over second time, it means the whitelist proposal draft by Parallel Finance team is not so well-audited by Tech fellows, yes?\nWe assume that the reality is that Polkadot tech-fellows quickly view the proposal and confirm it is harmless and then pass it out of good purpose. \n\nPoint is,**tech-fellows vote procedure does not match the endorse that whitelist referenda provide when it comes to parachain-level business**.\nWhy gives such level of generous response? \n\n\nFor those interested in the history:\n\nOur previous referenda:  \n[referenda/1326](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1326) Subject: Parallel Finance Guilty- Request for Investigation 2024/12/13\n\nParallel Finance four root referenda:\n\n[referenda/1322](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1322) Rebond DOT from Parallel Fi accounts - Description below    2024/12/04\n\n[referenda/1339](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1339)Critical Runtime Upgrade to Prevent Further Exploitation    2024/12/07\n\n[referenda/1424](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1424) Emergency Response Plan for Securing 200,000 DOT     2025/02/10       \n\n[referenda/1445](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1445)Plan B: Rebond 200k DOT for Parallel Fi                     2025/02/20",

      "title": "Polkadot Community Foundation: Allow the Marketing Bounty to Execute Formal Contracts through the Polkadot Community Foundation",
      "content": "This proposal establishes an overarching framework through which the Marketing Bounty can execute formal contracts with service providers on behalf of the Polkadot DAO. The Polkadot Community Foundation will act as the legal counterparty for these standardized contracts.\n\n## Article 1 - Definitions\n\n1. **Marketing Bounty (MB):** A treasury-funded on-chain body with a mandate to fund marketing initiatives that benefit the Polkadot Network. It was established in its current form by [Ref 1166](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1166).\n2. **Polkadot Community Foundation (PCF):** A foundation incorporated in the Cayman Islands that serves as a DAO Execution Vehicle on behalf of the Polkadot DAO in the physical world. It was established by [Ref 730](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/730).\n3. **Service Providers (SPs):** Third-party service providers, such as marketing agencies, are engaged by the MB to provide marketing-related services.\n\n## Article 2 - Considerations\n\n1. Some SPs require a physical address when writing an invoice. The MB, as an on-chain body, does not have a physical address. A legal counterparty with a physical address is needed.\n2. Some SPs only accept fiat currency as payment for their services. A legal counterparty is needed to process the contractually obligated payment.\n3. Some SPs require a formal legal entity to enter into *contracts* or *service agreements* before they can begin their work and need a legal entity to receive their invoices. The MB, as an extension of the Polkadot DAO, is not a legal entity. A legal counterparty is needed.\n4. The PCF, as a DAO Execution Vehicle acting on behalf of the Polkadot DAO, may be used to facilitate the process. As per the bylaws of the PCF, instructions to the PCF must be given through OpenGov. Instructing the PCF on a case-by-case basis for the MB would be cumbersome and slow, as each instruction requires a separate proposal submission via OpenGov (1–35 days, depending on the proposal), followed by a 60-day lockup period for PCF approval, plus additional time for contract negotiation and legal approval. A faster and more streamlined process would be sensible.\n\n## Article 3 - Framework\n\n1. The objective of this framework is to create a streamlined (fast and affordable) process for providing SPs with a legal counterparty and fiat payments if they require them.\n2. The MB is permitted to instruct the PCF to process fiat payments and manage contractual relationships and related administrative work (such as KYB procedures) with SPs.\n3. The costs incurred through these procedures must be covered by the MB. For example, costs may include processing fees and administrative fees for setting up and managing the contract, as well as the amount to be paid upon fulfillment of the contract.\n4. A dedicated account (“legal fund”) will be created to cover costs for services related to compliance, contract creation, contract management, contract negotiation, contract execution, and administrative fees of the PCF.\n5. To reduce costs and execution time, a set of standard contracts will be developed with the PCF and should be used whenever feasible. In addition, the Marketing Bounty shall have the discretion to set up custom contracts if the standard contracts do not work in specific situations. These will be discussed and agreed upon with the PCF on a case-by-case basis.\n6. The PCF may be instructed by the MB to liquidate a specified amount of assets in the legal fund into fiat via an OTC trade. This conversion to fiat may happen as part of a single payment or to ensure the legal fund keeps a reserve of fiat for future payments.\n\n## Article 4 - Instructions\n\n1. The PCF is instructed to set up an account on Polkadot Hub. The account is controlled by the PCF, and all costs of the PCF and its affiliates will only be deducted from this account. The Marketing Bounty will top up the account at its discretion.\n2. The PCF and MB are instructed to develop a library of standardized contract templates tailored for various marketing services (e.g., advertising campaigns, social media management, and event promotion). These contract templates cover essential, pre-agreed legal and operational criteria.\n3. The PCF and MB are instructed to define specific processes together and publish them on the transparency website of the MB.\n4. The PCF is instructed to execute instructions given by the MB to perform actions related to contract management, including but not limited to KYBing potential partners, contract setup, contract changes, contract termination, and payments. The MB shall do so through Child Bounties that contain clearly recognizable instructions to the PCF in the description field.\n5. The MB shall report quarterly on its business with the PCF so that stakeholders get a full picture of what costs and efforts have been incurred by the PCF.\n\n## Article 5 - Conditions\n\n1. **Scope Limitation:** Agreements are exclusively for marketing initiatives related to the Polkadot Marketing Bounty.\n2. **Compliance Requirements:** All contracts must comply with Cayman Islands law, Polkadot’s governance protocols, and any specific conditions set by the MB.\n3. **Approval Criteria:** Contracts must align with Polkadot’s marketing objectives and the MB mandate agreed upon in Ref 1166 and any potential future amendments agreed by OpenGov.",

      "content": "![](https://i.ibb.co/g6MNvCF/Screenshot-2025-01-17-at-4-55-16-PM.png)  \nThis is a chart with which we are all familiar. DOT vs BTC. To be honest, this chart is likely similar for the vast majority of alts on a longterm timeline.\n\nMuch like we have already done to stabilize our treasury by DCAing into stable coins such as USDC and USDT, I propose that we set aside 1 million DOT to engage in the same diversification strategy by slowly accumulating Bitcoin.\n\nWhile we are all DOT bulls at heart, many of us came to crypto through Bitcoin, and it has demonstrated that it is the apex predator of all digital assets. Over the last year, we have witnessed its newfound legitimacy among TradFi through the creation of the ETFs, and we are on the cusp of numerous states here in the U.S. (if not the whole country itself, as well as other nationstates) beginning to accumulate their own \"Bitcoin Strategic Reserves.\" It would be wise for us as a community to do the same.\n\nOver the coming years, this will provide a solid foundation for our treasury's value, and if we were ever in dire need due to running low on DOT or stables, we could tap into this value by converting it back into one of those two options. The main objective, however, would be to accumulate with the goal of not selling in an effort to drive the overall treasury value higher.\n\nI defer to the Hydration team when it comes to which wrapped version of the asset we should accumulate, as this would likely be dependent upon a number of factors such as the depth of liquidity in the Omnipool. I would also defer to someone else to create and implement the actual design of the technical proposal that would allow this to happen in a trustless way should the community agree to the wisdom of adding Bitcoin to our overall treasury reserves.\n\nGrateful for your consideration in this matter,\n\nYour resident Polkadot Bitcoiner, Phunky",

      "title": "Wish For Change | Polkadot Branding Guideline",
      "content": "## Overview\nThis WFC aims to tackle an issue within the Polkadot ecosystem that currently surrounds the branding, adoption, and awareness of Polkadot.\n\nWhilst many have received funding from the treasury, there are a number of teams, projects, and individuals who have not included Polkadot’s Logo, or its branding, as part of their own branding, campaign, product, or socials.\n\nTo help increase the visibility of Polkadot and thus, awareness of its adoption, we propose to make it a requirement to display the Polkadot Logo, in some format on their websites, campaign materials, products, socials, and other public materials.\n\n## Guidance to follow\nTeams who receive funding from the treasury, from any track, must adhere as closely as possible to the rules and guidelines set out by this WFC.\n\n### Minimum Requirements\n1. Teams who receive funding from the Treasury must display the Polkadot branding, for as long as their product, campaign or project is live and functioning. \n\n**Example:** A project team that has secured funding from the Treasury to build a new product. ‘Funded by Polkadot’ should be displayed somewhere on the landing page or product.\n\n2. The Branding / Logo will remain visible and will not be removed.\n\n3. When requesting money from the Treasury, teams shall explicitly say in their proposal what they intend to display, and where. Lack of acknowledgment of this WFC may result in voters questioning their proposal.\n\n### Wording and Design \nTeams are encouraged to use one, or multiple, of the following designs found within the [Polkadot brand hub. ](https://distractive.notion.site/Polkadot-Brand-Hub-df6eda0f66df453ba6f7d2712f30d036)These designs are up to date with the latest Polkadot branding [Q4 2024].\n\nThe designs are purely for guidance. You may also benefit from Distractive’s Ecosystem Resource Centre found [here](https://distractive.notion.site/Welcome-to-the-Ecosystem-Resource-Center-108345e121194b0c952864063b6c88dc) or heading directly to the [Polkadot website](https://polkadot.com/community/brand-hub) where you can find more assets.\n\nIn the end, it is your choice what to display, providing it is part of the Polkadot branding.\n\n### Branding Guidance\nWhilst this WFC cannot enforce what teams display, teams are advised to display what most accurately describes their product. As of now, there are no ‘set’ guidelines or definitions on each, thus we leave this choice up to the team themselves.\n\n- Secured by Polkadot\n- Powered by Polkadot\n- Funded by Polkadot\n\n## Next steps\n### Going Forward\nThe enactment of this Wish For Change will ensure that anyone looking to be funded by the Polkadot Treasury must represent the Polkadot Branding. How you display the branding is your choice, but we heavily encourage the usage of\n\n- The Polkadot Logo\n- The usage of one of the branding designs in the [Polkadot brand hub.](https://distractive.notion.site/Polkadot-Brand-Hub-df6eda0f66df453ba6f7d2712f30d036)\n\n## Appendix\n### Important to note\nSince OpenGov’s debut in 2023, we’ve seen numerous projects, teams and individuals have had their referenda executed, granting them funding from the Polkadot Treasury.\n\n- We encourage the DAO’s, DV’s and DOT Holders to help us enforce this Wish For Change, if approved.\n\n- Going forward, teams, projects and individuals who have requested funding, but have no mention of displaying the logo should be questioned as to why, before having their referenda execute and or, be voted upon.\n\n- Teams, projects and individuals who have received funding already, and or will receive funding before this Wish For Change passes cannot be held to this Wish For Change.\n  - This being said, all teams, present and previous will be highly encouraged to include the logo as part of their branding.\n\n- **Exemptions**\n  - Whilst rare, there may be a case where an individual has received funding but has no way to display the logo. This can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\n  - Tipping for work done, whether this be retroactive or not, will be of course exempt. If it is easy for you to do, then by all means go ahead, otherwise there is no minimum requirement.\n\n### Motivation behind the WFC\nPolkadot, the world's largest DAO, allows any DOT holder to partake in governance, including requesting money from the Polkadot Treasury. \n\nEvery DOT holder has the right to decide what happens with treasury funds, as they are part of the DAO, it is their money that is being awarded to teams, projects and individuals. \n\nWhilst we encourage participation in the treasury, we also believe that being proud and showcasing Polkadot is a mutually beneficial relationship. If Polkadot has helped fund you, in any way, then it should be a right that DOT Holders can see their logo showcased and displayed proudly on teams, projects and individuals it has helped fund.\n\nThe end goal of this Wish For Change is something that benefits all DOT Holders, Individuals and project teams, helping bring visibility to the Polkadot Ecosystem.",

      "title": "Introduce quadratic funding to the polkadot treasury spending",
      "content": "This proposal aims to introduce a way to do quadratic funding(QF) in the polkadot ecosystem which brings an alternative mechanism for the polkadot treasury spending. In a QF funding round, projects will share a fixed public fund pool and the final distribution will be decided by the community votes which are calculated by weighted square root of voters' donation.\n\n## Problem statement\n\nTreasury spending is one of the biggest topics in polkadot governance and there are dramas about it. Main problems about current OpenGov treasury spend model include:\n\n- Whales are playing too important roles.\n- Irrational votes.\n- Possible collusion.\n- Influence of Low token holders with high contributions is low.\n- Lack of global perspectives, plans and budget about treasury spend.\n\nSo it turns out:\n\n- Results of most referenda are finally decided by several whales.\n- Community members may not vote against an unreasonable proposal because they may offend the proposer.\n- Many community members complain about treasury spend, but what they can do is limited.\n- Teams are proposing an amount that just depends on their own calculation, not under a global budget or spend plan. So teams don’t have to control their budget if their referenda can keep passing.\n\n## Quadratic funding\n\nFollowing are several tips about how quadratic funding works:\n\n- There is a public funding pool for a funding round.\n- Different applicants(teams) share this pool by votes they received.\n- Communities vote on a project by donating their assets to an applicant project.\n- The more donors and the more funds an applicant project receives, the more a project will share the pool.\n\n![qf-example.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmekRBbT1quoRpB8vcaJq9KjduMUn6ocUjbBTNHtLkBr8w)\n\nHere is an example. Projects A, B and C will share 10,000 DOT in total. Finally All of these 3 projects received 1,000 DOT donations, but A has 5 donors(200 DOT each), B has 2 donors(500 DOT each), and C has 20 donors(50 DOT each). Obviously C has broader support, so C shares the most of the pool.\n\nWe can learn more from [gitcoin](https://www.gitcoin.co) which is the biggest quadratic funding platform in the ethereum ecosystem.\n\n### Challenges\n\nThere are mainly 2 challenges we’ve seen.\n\n1. Sybil attacks. A project can create many accounts and donate assets to himself.\n2. Incentivisation. A community member will think it a stupid decision to give out their own money while there is a public fund pool, especially when the public fund is not spent reasonably.\n\n![qf-sybil-solutions.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdsJSQfaSHDGG3Ux2qksAaQtrYAPpytTDSBhwao6nV1nu)\n\nFor the first challenge, we will introduce voter weights. Each voter(donor) will have a weight calculated by history on chain behaviors and off chain data bindings. So if a voter has more on chain contributions and more off chain proof which can prove it is a real person, he/she will get a higher weight. Attackers’ weight value will be 0, no affection to the final result.\n\nSome ideas can be used for donation(vote) Incentivisation. For example, if a voter donated 50 DOT, there will be a 50% possibility he/she can get 100 DOT as reward. Of course we can set a cap to each voter’s reward to encourage small donations.\n\n## How to do it in polkadot\n![qf-steps.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYwUGueCK5PTbqEYVLZHqDQubGmq1Wn44FqHYjsCLUy5R)\n\n- A bounty will be created to hold funding pool assets.\n- Funding rounds will be created with a predetermined budget. Each round may have a topic for similar projects.\n- Projects apply to join a funding round and curators will review them.\n- Communities make donations in a funding round by transferring their assets(DOT) to the applicant project’s address.\n- Quadratic funding platforms do calculation, audit and submit results to curators. Funds are distributed to applicant projects through child bounties. Rewards are sent to voters.\n\n### An off chain reputation system\n\nEvery address will have a voting weight in a funding round which will affect the final votes. An address' voting weight is decided by 2 groups of factors.\n1. History on-chain behaviors.\n2. Off chain social info binded to this address which can prove there is a real person or an entity behind this address.\n\nMany tags will be defined according to upper factors, and each tag will have a score in a funding round. An address' score will be calculated based on how many tags this address has, and its final weight depends on this score.\n\n### Audit\n\nFollowing info will be provided in case the community's audit:\n\n1. Final fund distribution through child bounties.\n3. All on chain transfers for donation.\n4. Detailed voting weight info of an address, including:\n    - Tags this address has.\n    - Score of each tag in a funding round.\n    - Off chain social info binded and related links.\n\nAlmost all actions or info can be verified by on chain data except the binded off chain social info, but in most cases these data can be verified by public social media links.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### 1. Will QF take the place of treasury funding by OpenGov?\n\nNo. QF provides an alternative way for the polkadot treasury spending which can bring benefits the OpenGov way lacks.\n\n### 2. Can a project apply for a treasury fund through OpenGov if get funded in a QF round?\n\nYes. QF works in parallel with OpenGov, but all the data is transparent and the community will take into account the funds obtained by QF in a OpenGov proposal review process. At the same time, QF will show the community's preference to a project by the donations.\n\n### 3. I'm a whale, why should I support QF?\n\nA whale benefit most from QF because:\n- It improves the collective decisions of polkadot about treasury spending.\n- Several steps of QF like bounty approvals, curators appointment, fund top up are still controlled by OpenGov, and your votes will still play important roles.\n- Reputation system in QF encourages the community to make more contributions to the eco.\n\nAll in all, QF improves the rationalization of the polkadot treasury spending, restores the community’s confidence, and finally increases the value of polkadot.",

      "title": "Set a 5% Minimum Validator Commission Fee for Polkadot",
      "content": "**Proposal: Setting a 5% Minimum Validator Commission Fee for Polkadot**\n\nWith the enactment of the governance proposal to reduce Polkadot's inflation rate to 120 million DOT per year and the recent increase in the validator set size from 297 to 500, we believe we should consider setting a minimum validator commission fee for Polkadot. This proposal aims to ensure the sustainability of smaller validator operators, maintain decentralization, and meet the growing hardware and operational requirements as Polkadot scales.\n\n**Motivation** Validator profitability has been significantly impacted by:\n\n-   Increased Validator Set: The expansion to 500 validators has diluted rewards.\n-   Reduced Inflation: The reduction to 120 million DOT per year has further lowered overall staking rewards.\n-   Increased Costs: New hardware requirements for running a validator, particularly with the upcoming JAM upgrade, have dramatically increased the costs of operation.\n\nThe average validator currently earns significantly less than a year ago, while the costs of running a validator are increasing due to:\n\n<u>Higher hardware standards:</u>\n\n1.  CPU: Intel Ice Lake/AMD Zen 3 with 8 physical cores @ 3.4GHz.\n2.  Storage: 1 TB NVMe SSDs with mirror redundancy.\n3.  Memory: 32 GB DDR4 ECC.\n4.  Network: Minimum 500 Mbit/s symmetric speed.\n\n<u>Database size:</u> Polkadot blockchain expands by over 500 MB daily, with a pruned database exceeding 500 GB ([StakeWorld Database Size Analysis](https://stakeworld.io/docs/dbsize)). This limits the capacity to run multiple validators on a single machine, with most hosting providers limiting storage capacity to mirrored 1tb NVME’s.\n\n<u>Revenue Decline:</u> A year ago, 1% commission earned ~13.8 DOT per era. Currently, 1% commission earns ~6 DOT per era—**a 56% reduction**. At the average commission rate of 3.6% (excluding private 100% commission validators), a validator earns 21.6 DOT per era ($125.28 at $5.8/DOT) compared to 49.68 DOT per era ($288.14) previously. These dynamics create unsustainable conditions for smaller operators, discouraging new entrants and increasing reliance on large staking providers.\n\n**Proposal** Introduce a Minimum Commission Fee of 5% for Polkadot Validators. This aligns with Kusama’s existing practice, ensuring validator operators can cover operational expenses and reinvest in hardware and infrastructure while preserving network decentralization.\n\n**Benefits of a Minimum Commission Fee**\n\n<u>Decentralization:</u>\n\n-   Encourages diverse participation by smaller operators.\n-   Reduces dominance of large staking providers that can subsidize lower commissions.\n\n<u>Economic Sustainability:</u>\n\n-   Allows validators to meet the increasing operational costs.\n-   Provides incentives for new operators to join the network, ensuring long-term validator diversity. It can take months for a new validator to gain enough nominations to get active.\n\n<u>Parity with Kusama:</u>\n\n-   Establishing a 5% minimum commission aligns Polkadot with Kusama’s proven approach.\n\n<u>Security and Performance:</u>\n\n-   Ensures validators can afford high-quality hardware, enhancing network reliability.\n\n  \n_\\* Please note that the main intent for this proposal is to gather feedback and get the discussion started.  \n_",

      "title": "Bounty Compliance Standards 1.0",
      "content": "This document lays out standards which shall apply to all bounties funded through Polkadot OpenGov. The basic intention is to ensure that minimum standards are upheld before a budget is granted. It defines how these executive bodies should handle budgeting, transparency, and compliance.\n\n## 1\\. Bounty Objectives\n\n1.  Bounties shall have a clearly defined list of objectives by which their success can be judged by the community.\n2.  Funds may only spent within the boundaries of the objectives for which the funds were requested.\n\n## 2\\. Funding\n\n1.  Bounties may request funding at a maximum of one time per quarter.\n2.  Funding requests must include\n    1.  Budget breakdown: The budget has to give an honest picture of the intended spending and be broken down into positions. Positions should be explained in sufficient detail.\n    2.  Timeframe: The timeframe should give clarity to OpenGov when it can expect the next funding request.\n    3.  Transparency reports that cover past activities up to the time of the request.\n3.  A funding request has to be put up for discussion in any of the established governance platforms or the Polkadot forum for at least 2 weeks before it is put to a vote.\n\n## 3\\. Curators\n\n1.  All curators must have a verified on-chain identity.\n2.  Payment terms of curators must be outlined in the funding request. If curators shall receive payment, including for prior work, it has to be defined in the payment terms.\n3.  Curators may not sign payments for work that they have executed, except curator compensation.\n4.  Curators must not claim compensation for work that they already have been compensated for otherwise.\n5.  Curators have to publicly declare and document any conflicts of interest that come up during their duty.\n6.  Curators have to publicly report any misbehavior or other issues that conflict with the effective and efficient operation of the bounty.\n\n## 4\\. Recipients\n\n1.  All recipients must have a verified on-chain identity.\n2.  Recipients must not claim compensation for work that they already have been compensated for otherwise.\n\n## 5\\. Transparency\n\nBounties are required to provide the following materials for transparency:\n\n1.  Official public communication channel where curators are regularly available and the public can participate\n2.  Regularly updated official overview page\n    1.  Objectives\n    2.  Main contact point\n    3.  Link to the public communication channel\n    4.  A list of all current curators\n    5.  Links to all progress summaries and all other transparency materials listed below\n    6.  Links to relevant documentation\n    7.  Link to current child bounties h. Guidance for executors on how to participate in the bounty\n3.  Spending Policy, including how curators are compensated\n4.  A table of child bounties that contains: status, name, description, amount, beneficiary username, beneficiary address, links to evidence. The table is available in an open format (XLSX, CSV, or similar)\n5.  Monthly progress summary posted to the bounty page, signed off by at least one curator\n    1.  Current status of projects\n    2.  Current bounty balance\n    3.  Current plans d. Notable changes to objectives, curation team, operations, etc.\n6.  Quarterly financial statement\n    1.  Balance\n    2.  Income and Expenses\n    3.  Summary of curator payments\n    4.  Summary of payments by recipient\n    5.  available in an open format (XLSX, CSV or similar)\n\n# Appendix\n\nThese are additional questions we have received and considerations we have discussed. They are not included in the on-chain proposal (to keep the proposal minimal) and are intended to help you interpret the intention of the proposal.\n\n## Bounty Objectives\n\n### Would a strategy be considered the defined objectives?\n\nA strategy is much bigger. Objectives are the first part of a strategy. So yes, a proper strategy contains objectives. However, a list of objectives doesn't yet make a strategy.\n\n### Shouldn't a bounty be able to change its objectives?\n\nYes. Bounties need to be able to adapt to changing circumstances. However, if a bounty promises to do work to achieve a certain goal it should not take the granted money and do something different with it. If it wants to change what the money is designated for, it should have to request a change.\n\nLikewise, it is easy for a bounty to change the objectives for future funding, because it is submitting a funding request anyways. In the context of requesting new funding, it can also communicate changed objectives.\n\n### Should there be success metrics?\n\nIn general it would be very helpful to measure against hard metrics. The problem is that it is really hard to arrive at reasonable metrics and very often people come up with bad metrics just so that they can provide KPIs. We have chosen to not include a requirement for metrics yet, because the ecosystem as a whole is not yet mature enough to have agreed on the right metrics. A good first step is to start finding the metrics that make sense before prescribing that metrics have to be used.\n\n### Should a bounty end date be defined?\n\nIn the past, OpenGov has shown to just close bounties when they stopped performing. We don't think this has to be explicitely defined.\n\n## Funding\n\n### Will bounties be denied funding if they don't follow the rules outlined in this document?\n\nIt is still up to OpenGov, but the idea is that OpenGov shall question bounties that do not provide these things. We suggest OpenGov denies funding requests if proper scoping and transparency criteria are not fulfilled.\n\n### Why should a funding request contain a budget breakdown with specific details? Aren't the details already provided with the objectives?\n\nThe objectives long-term and generic in nature. The quarterly budget is focused on specific projects. It might touch only some of the objectives or with different priorities. It is more specific. The idea is to communicate specific plans for how the money is used, not some general ambitions.\n\n## Transparency\n\n### Summary and Details\n\nThere are 2 parts to transparency: summary and details\n\n-   **For the casual observer, getting a quick overview summary is important.** For them, the answer cannot be that they can \"look it up in a table, drive folder, meeting notes, or on-chain\". Casual observers are the majority of the participants. For the casual observer, short summaries are important. Auditors need summaries to save time.\n-   **For the transparency nerd, detail is important.** For them (and auditors), being able to verify all the claims given in summaries is crucial. Bonus points if it is structured data to allow automation to take place.\n\nWhen we talk about transparency, both aspects are needed: summary and details.\n\n### But transparency creates extra work\n\nYes, dealing with other peoples money requires making it transparent what you did with the money.\n\n### Simple and short is fine\n\nYou don't need a dedicated website. Updating the description on the bounty pages in governance explorers like Subsquare/Polkassembly is very much fine.

Funds may only spent within the boundaries of the objectives for which the funds were requested.\n\n## 2\\. Funding\n\n1.  Bounties may request funding at a maximum of one time per quarter.\n2.  Funding requests must include a. Budget breakdown: The budget has to give an honest picture of the intended spending and be broken down into positions. Positions should be explained in sufficient detail. b. Timeframe: The timeframe should give clarity to OpenGov when it can expect the next funding request. c. Transparency reports that cover past activities up to the time of the request.\n3.  A funding request has to be put up for discussion in any of the established governance platforms or the Polkadot forum for at least 2 weeks before it is put to a vote.\n\n## 3\\. Curators\n\n1.  All curators must have a verified on-chain identity.\n2.  Payment terms of curators must be outlined in the funding request. If curators shall receive payment, including for prior work, it has to be defined in the payment terms.\n3.  Curators may not sign payments for work that they have executed, except curator compensation.\n4.

Transparency\n\nBounties are required to provide the following materials for transparency:\n\n1.

They are not included in the on-chain proposal (to keep the proposal minimal) and are intended to help you interpret the intention of the proposal.\n\n## Bounty Objectives\n\n### Would a strategy be considered the defined objectives?\n\nA strategy is much bigger. Objectives are the first part of a strategy. So yes, a proper strategy contains objectives. However, a list of objectives doesn't yet make a strategy.\n\n### Shouldn't a bounty be able to change its objectives?\n\nYes. Bounties need to be able to adapt to changing circumstances. However, if a bounty promises to do work to achieve a certain goal it should not take the granted money and do something different with it. If it wants to change what the money is designated for, it should have to request a change.\n\nLikewise, it is easy for a bounty to change the objectives for future funding, because it is submitting a funding request anyways. In the context of requesting new funding, it can also communicate changed objectives.\n\n### Should there be success metrics?\n\nIn general it would be very helpful to measure against hard metrics. The problem is that it is really hard to arrive at reasonable metrics and very often people come up with bad metrics just so that they can provide KPIs. We have chosen to not include a requirement for metrics yet, because the ecosystem as a whole is not yet mature enough to have agreed on the right metrics. A good first step is to start finding the metrics that make sense before prescribing that metrics have to be used.\n\n### Should a bounty end date be defined?\n\nIn the past, OpenGov has shown to just close bounties when they stopped performing. We don't think this has to be explicitely defined.\n\n## Funding\n\n### Will bounties be denied funding if they don't follow the rules outlined in this document?\n\nIt is still up to OpenGov, but the idea is that OpenGov shall question bounties that do not provide these things. We suggest OpenGov denies funding requests if proper scoping and transparency criteria are not fulfilled.\n\n### Why should a funding request contain a budget breakdown with specific details? Aren't the details already provided with the objectives?\n\nThe objectives long-term and generic in nature. The quarterly budget is focused on specific projects. It might touch only some of the objectives or with different priorities. It is more specific. The idea is to communicate specific plans for how the money is used, not some general ambitions.\n\n## Transparency\n\n### Summary and Details\n\nThere are 2 parts to transparency: summary and details\n\n-   **For the casual observer, getting a quick overview summary is important.** For them, the answer cannot be that they can \"look it up in a table, drive folder, meeting notes, or on-chain\". Casual observers are the majority of the participants. For the casual observer, short summaries are important. Auditors need summaries to save time.\n-   **For the transparency nerd, detail is important.** For them (and auditors), being able to verify all the claims given in summaries is crucial. Bonus points if it is structured data to allow automation to take place.\n\nWhen we talk about transparency, both aspects are needed: summary and details.\n\n### But transparency creates extra work\n\nYes, dealing with other peoples money requires making it transparent what you did with the money.\n\n### Simple and short is fine\n\nYou don't need a dedicated website. Updating the description on the bounty pages in governance explorers like Subsquare/Polkassembly is very much fine. It even helps casual observers find your information quickly.\n\nThe same is true for summaries, reports, etc. Keep them short and simple and save everyone time.\n\n### Overview Page\n\nThe overview page can be a the Subsquare/Polkassembly page, a dedicated website, Notion page or similar.

      "content": "## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to simplify and unify the address format across the Polkadot ecosystem to improve user experience and reduce user confusion. Currently, over 150 registered entries use different SS58 address prefixes, creating fragmentation and complicating the user experience.\n\nThis proposal is a result of multiple discussions which were consolidated in the polkadot forum. This post provides more detailed explanation and reasoning behind the proposed changes:\n\n[https://forum.polkadot.network/t/unifying-polkadot-ecosystem-address-format/10042](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/unifying-polkadot-ecosystem-address-format/10042)\n\n🚧 This initiative falls under the UX Bounty scope and the necessary resources will be covered by its budget. You can find all relevant materials [here](https://www.notion.so/braille-wtf/UXB-1-UX-Issue-1-Unified-Address-Format-9e7c414ae769471c9016c9d8463a4d49).\n\n## Proposed Changes\n\n-   Adopt a unified SS58 address format for all compatible Polkadot parachains:\n    \n    -   Use Prefix:0 (addresses starting with '1') for all compatible chains that wish to connect to Polkadot ecosystem\n    -   This allows users to easily recognize their accounts across different chains\n\nImplement readable address prefixes roughly based on [EIP-3770](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3770) to help prevent users from sending assets to the wrong chain\n\n-   This allows users to easily see the intended destination chain when copying address\n\n       ![readable-prefix](https://i.ibb.co/NYTBQKv/7eb16e0314f51c593e14306d7e2fec67b6142122.png)\n\n## Benefits\n\n-   Simplifies user experience across the ecosystem\n-   Reduces confusion caused by multiple address formats\n-   Minimizes the risk of users sending assets to incorrect chains\n-   Streamlines development processes for builders in the ecosystem\n\n## Implementation\n\nAs a part of the UX bounty, we will do the following to ease implementation of this proposal:\n\n-   Create detailed guides for developers to ensure a seamless transition\n-   Create specification for the prefix decoding\n-   Develop explanatory documents and tools for users and developers to be able to provide support during the transition period (i.e. address conversion tool, prefix decoder)\n-   Work with wallet providers, dApps, and exchanges to help them update their interfaces\n\n## Notes\n\n-   The wish for change serves as guidance; chains and dApps can choose their own prefixes, however this wish for change proposal aims to show, that the users of the Polkadot ecosystem wish to simplify the UX within the ecosystem and it is advisable to follow this change.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis change will significantly enhance the user experience within the Polkadot ecosystem, making it more accessible and user-friendly for both new and existing users. It will also reduce the complexity for developers building on the platform.",

      "title": "Inflation decreasing - Gavin Wood vision",
      "content": "Why should we experiment with inflation when Gavin Wood himself came up with a great idea:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3kRAVBTkfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3kRAVBTkfs) — 1:31:40 timing\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/WPZMHJx/image.png)\n\nThe point is create a maximum supply value, such as Pi number (3.14159) so inflation will be 10% of the difference between the maximum supply and the current supply. In other words, inflation will be 10% of the remaining supply.\n\nExample:  \nNow we have around 1 500 000 000 $DOT, if we set maximum supply value on 3 141 590 000 its mean with inflation rate 10% our inflation will be:\n\ninflation in first year:  \n%10 from (3 141 590 000 - 1 500 000 000) = %10 from (1 641 590 000) = 164 159 000 $dot  \nsupply after first year:  \n1 500 000 000 + 164 159 000 = 1 664 159 000 $dot\n\ninflation in second year:  \n%10 from (3 141 590 000 - 1 664 159 000) = %10 from (1 477 431 000) = 147 743 100 $dot  \nsupply after second year:  \n1 664 159 000 + 147 743 100 = 1 811 902 100 $dot\n\nAnd so on. The point is that we will never reach maximum supply, or rather, it will take decades. The same with $btc. I hope everyone understood the formula proposed by @gavofyork on interwiev with @TheKusamarian .\n\nAlthough I hope I haven't made any mistakes, there is still such a chance, so I advise everyone to watch a part of interview.\n\nI believe that of those currently offered, this model has a number of advantages:\n\n1.  We get a extrimely concrete and clear path for the next 5-10 years and can close the issue related to inflation. WFC #1139 which was recently approved does not have such an advantage, it only indicates the path for the next year, with the wish to reduce inflation in the future - \"8% total inflation in the first year, then gradually decreasing\". This is how it sounds. Discussions of inflation have always slowed down the community and generated a lot of controversy, unfortunatelly there is no garanty in a year we will not have another energy-consuming vote on further decreasing inflation. And it is not a fact that we will be able to come to a consensus. This path is foggy for me, with all due respect to the author of this proposal. Also WFC #1139 caused panic among some investors due to the sudden change in #Polkadot's economic model. According to WFC #1139, there is again no garanty that we we won't have to intervene in the economic model every year. Surely, large and especially conservative $DOT holders will not be happy about this. In turn, the new proposal (WFC #1216) aims to follow a concrete path that will not need to be changed year after year due to changing market conditions.\n2.  Only such a path looks complete. I mean it is self-sufficient and does not need constant updates and guessing what to do next year after year. @gavofyork suggestion looks like a plan, not just a wish. Let's vote for a plan, this is strategically correct. WFC #1139 can lead us into a fog.\n3.  Think about the trust we will gain from current and new potential investors who will finally realize that our supply will never even multiply by 2. Admit it, everyone is now horrified by the thought that with the current inflation our supply is multiplied by 2 every 7 years. Now this will not happen anywhere near. No doubts when coinmarketcap and coingecko users see the \"max supply\" bar appear next to Polkadot they will be pleasantly excited. This is a huge boost. Others L0 chains will now have to catch up with us in this race. Since the best decision related to inflation will be ours. And again, new users will prefer to invest in the project where they are confident that their portfolio will not depreciate every 7 years by 2.\n\nThe diferences between WFC by Jonas and WFC #1216 not sensitive. I would even say @gavofyork proposal is even better: because in the first year, no one will feel the changes, this will allow you to get used to smooth changes. And in the further years, inflation will not be much different, and still be a little less in WFC #1216, which is also an advantage. Since we no longer have parachain auctions. And of course, all the advantages that I wrote about above.\n\n**— MY ADDITION**\n\nAll I want to change in Gavin's proposal is the final maximum supply. I want to change it from the proposed number Pi ( 3.14159) to a smaller one - Euler's number ( 2.71828 ). Gavin said it could be any beautiful or interesting number, so I picked Euler's number, also because Polkadot community expresses interest in a slightly greater decreasing inflation. There is 13.47% of difference, which is very insignificant, very conservative.\n\n**— VOTING FOR**\n\nSo, by voting for this proposal you are voting for the inflation reduction model proposed by the Founder of Polkadot - Gavin Wood. All the details in the video (don't be lazy, spend 9 minutes of your life watching it), plus my idea to change the number Pi to Euler's number.\n\n**— REVERSIBILITY OF YOUR VOICE IN THE FUTURE**\n\nIf this WFC will be successfully passed, it will not mean immediate changes on chain. This vote only represents the opinion and desire of the community. If approved, the next WFC will compete in popularity with WFC \"#1139 Polkadot's Economics Parameters: Proposal 3 (8% total inflation in the first year, then gradually decreasing)\"\n\nIf this WFC will be successfully passed, and then if this WFC will be more popular in competition with WFC #1139 next steps will be inviting Polkadot Founder — Gavin Wood to create a final referendum with changes in the chain.\n\n**— SOME FACTS AND MATHEMATICS**\n\nnumber Pi — 3.14159\n\nEuler's number — 2.71828\n\nEuler's number (e) is an irrational mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828. It plays a key role in calculus, especially in the study of exponential growth and decay, and is the base of the natural logarithm. The number e appears in many areas of mathematics, including complex analysis, probability theory, and differential equations.\n\nWhat is remarkable is that if we do the calculations, we get approximately the same inflation rate with WFC #1139, in the same time gaining the prospect of optimism from current and future investors due to maximum supply. We will really calm investors down when they see that our supply will never even multiply by 2. Because now I notice a lot of talk like every 7 years our supply doubles, this really sounds scary. And also in this WFC we really do get light at the end of the tunnel, there will be no need to plunge every year into the fog of disputes about the constant reduction of inflation.",

In other words, inflation will be 10% of the remaining supply.\n\nExample:  \nNow we have around 1 500 000 000 $DOT, if we set maximum supply value on 3 141 590 000 its mean with inflation rate 10% our inflation will be:\n\ninflation in first year:  \n%10 from (3 141 590 000 - 1 500 000 000) = %10 from (1 641 590 000) = 164 159 000 $dot  \nsupply after first year:  \n1 500 000 000 + 164 159 000 = 1 664 159 000 $dot\n\ninflation in second year:  \n%10 from (3 141 590 000 - 1 664 159 000) = %10 from (1 477 431 000) = 147 743 100 $dot  \nsupply after second year:  \n1 664 159 000 + 147 743 100 = 1 811 902 100 $dot\n\nAnd so on. The point is that we will never reach maximum supply, or rather, it will take decades. The same with $btc. I hope everyone understood the formula proposed by @gavofyork on interwiev with @TheKusamarian .\n\nAlthough I hope I haven't made any mistakes, there is still such a chance, so I advise everyone to watch a part of interview.\n\nI believe that of those currently offered, this model has a number of advantages:\n\n1.  We get a extrimely concrete and clear path for the next 5-10 years and can close the issue related to inflation. WFC #1139 which was recently approved does not have such an advantage, it only indicates the path for the next year, with the wish to reduce inflation in the future - \"8% total inflation in the first year, then gradually decreasing\". This is how it sounds. Discussions of inflation have always slowed down the community and generated a lot of controversy, unfortunatelly there is no garanty in a year we will not have another energy-consuming vote on further decreasing inflation. And it is not a fact that we will be able to come to a consensus. This path is foggy for me, with all due respect to the author of this proposal. Also WFC #1139 caused panic among some investors due to the sudden change in #Polkadot's economic model. According to WFC #1139, there is again no garanty that we we won't have to intervene in the economic model every year. Surely, large and especially conservative $DOT holders will not be happy about this. In turn, the new proposal (WFC #1216) aims to follow a concrete path that will not need to be changed year after year due to changing market conditions.\n2.  Only such a path looks complete. I mean it is self-sufficient and does not need constant updates and guessing what to do next year after year. @gavofyork suggestion looks like a plan, not just a wish. Let's vote for a plan, this is strategically correct. WFC #1139 can lead us into a fog.\n3.  Think about the trust we will gain from current and new potential investors who will finally realize that our supply will never even multiply by 2. Admit it, everyone is now horrified by the thought that with the current inflation our supply is multiplied by 2 every 7 years. Now this will not happen anywhere near. No doubts when coinmarketcap and coingecko users see the \"max supply\" bar appear next to Polkadot they will be pleasantly excited. This is a huge boost. Others L0 chains will now have to catch up with us in this race. Since the best decision related to inflation will be ours. And again, new users will prefer to invest in the project where they are confident that their portfolio will not depreciate every 7 years by 2.\n\nThe diferences between WFC by Jonas and WFC #1216 not sensitive. I would even say @gavofyork proposal is even better: because in the first year, no one will feel the changes, this will allow you to get used to smooth changes. And in the further years, inflation will not be much different, and still be a little less in WFC #1216, which is also an advantage. Since we no longer have parachain auctions. And of course, all the advantages that I wrote about above.\n\n**— MY ADDITION**\n\nAll I want to change in Gavin's proposal is the final maximum supply. I want to change it from the proposed number Pi ( 3.14159) to a smaller one - Euler's number ( 2.71828 ). Gavin said it could be any beautiful or interesting number, so I picked Euler's number, also because Polkadot community expresses interest in a slightly greater decreasing inflation. There is 13.47% of difference, which is very insignificant, very conservative.\n\n**— VOTING FOR**\n\nSo, by voting for this proposal you are voting for the inflation reduction model proposed by the Founder of Polkadot - Gavin Wood. All the details in the video (don't be lazy, spend 9 minutes of your life watching it), plus my idea to change the number Pi to Euler's number.\n\n**— REVERSIBILITY OF YOUR VOICE IN THE FUTURE**\n\nIf this WFC will be successfully passed, it will not mean immediate changes on chain. This vote only represents the opinion and desire of the community. If approved, the next WFC will compete in popularity with WFC \"#1139 Polkadot's Economics Parameters: Proposal 3 (8% total inflation in the first year, then gradually decreasing)\"\n\nIf this WFC will be successfully passed, and then if this WFC will be more popular in competition with WFC #1139 next steps will be inviting Polkadot Founder — Gavin Wood to create a final referendum with changes in the chain.\n\n**— SOME FACTS AND MATHEMATICS**\n\nnumber Pi — 3.14159\n\nEuler's number — 2.71828\n\nEuler's number (e) is an irrational mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.

      "title": "Polkadot's Economics Parameters: Proposal 1 (10% constant total inflation)",
      "content": "# Overview\nThe Wish for Change (WFC) referendum is part of a series of referendums aimed at probing token holders' sentiment regarding proposed updates to Polkadot's economic parameters. The key changes include implementing a fixed treasury inflow, removing the adjustment of staking rewards based on the discrepancy between the ideal staking rate and the actual staking rate, and potentially reducing overall inflation.\n\nThere has been extensive discussions in the community about this topic leading up to these referenda. Here is a reading list:\n\n1) [Implementing a fixed treasury inflow](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/adjusting-the-current-inflation-model-to-sustain-treasury-inflow/3301)\n2) [Necessary upgrades to allow for governance changes of inflation](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadots-economics-tools-to-shape-the-forseeable-future/8708?u=jonas)\n3) [Livestream with discussion on inflation](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1LyGBgvOaqpJN)\n4) [Forum discussion on inflation](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/proposal-for-adjusting-polkadots-inflation-system-reducing-issuance-and-complexity/9157?u=jonas)\n\n### Rules\n\n- Only a WFC that is executed can be considered a candidate (i.e., it must be gathering enough approval).\n- If one or more WFCs are accepted, the one with more AYE votes (weighted with conviction) is considered the preferred candidate.\n- Ideally, WFCs should be run mostly in parallel.\n\n### Important\nThe WFC referendum cannot be binding, i.e., there is no mechanism to force the chain to update the parameters to the one specified in the WFC. Instead, it is a method to aggregate the opinion of voters through OpenGov and offers some commitment of the community to one WFC on the social layer.\n\n### Ways forward\nThe goal is to put forward a root referendum after the WFCs ended that implement the logic of the winning WFC. The proposed parameters in each WFC would achieve their goals but it might be that it's more efficient to implement the code otherwise. Importantly, we agree on the outcome as stated in the REMARK of the winning referendum.\n\n# This WFC\n\nVoting AYE for this proposal expresses your approval of keeping the total inflation at 10% and implementing a constant 15% of that as Treasury inflow.\n\nThe following parameters would achieve that:\n\n`MaxStakerReward:` 85%\n`max_inflation:` 10%\n`min_inflation:` 8.5%\n\nREMARK: `10% constant total inflation (on current total issuance) with 15% to Treasury`",

      "content": "This referenda is for the network to signal that they agree with increasing the recommended core count for reference hardware from 4 to 8, starting with January 2025, the rationale behind this has been already presented and discussed here: https://forum.polkadot.network/t/rfc-increasing-recommended-minimum-core-count-for-reference-hardware/8156 and advertised among validator groups on Polkadot validator lounge and Kusama validator and people seem to be generally on board with it.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe polkadot binary is a multithreaded program that will benefit from having more hardware cores available, and all configurations are tuned to take into consideration the worst case scenario on the worse recommended hardware configuration. Currently, the minimum [hardware requirements](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#reference-hardware) recommends at least 4 hardware cores with SMT disabled.\n\nWith async backing enabled parachains can now produce bigger blocks which take a lot more time to execute, at a minimum each validator have to check(re-execute) each relay chain block at least 7(relayVrfModuloSamples = 6 + 1 for backing) parachain blocks, given only 50% percent of the CPU cores is allocated for this operation, the average parachains block execution times will not be bigger than 1.7s(2 cores * 6s / 7 checks).\n\nWith all that in mind, we think that raising the minimum core count for [validators](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#reference-hardware)  from 4 to 8 is a change that greatly helps the Polkadot network overall to prepare for a future where usage increases 10x or more and it is a change that we should start proactively rather than wait until the maximum theoretical throughput is met.\n\n## Note\nThere will be no change in the way **polkadot** binary behave when a given machine does not satisfy the reference hardware requirements, it will print a warning and continues executing using the available resources.",

The repeated nature of this happening sets long-term positive speculation. \n\n## Proposal Details:\n- **Inflation Reduction:** Reduce the inflation rate of DOT by 50%.\n- **Marketing Narrative:** Drive the \"Polkadot Halving\" narrative across all marketing channels to create awareness and excitement within the community.\n- **Future Proposals:** If this WFC is agreed upon, it is with the understanding that another Polkadot Halving WFC will be proposed for the community to vote on, after each BTC Halving (approximately every four years from the day of this Polkadot Halving WFC). This will allow the community to gauge and adjust according to the ecosystem's growth.\n- **The Halving Date:** The Fellowship can decide the date and time aiming to be within three months of this WFC.\n\n## Long-Term Vision:\nThe long-term vision is to establish a recurring following each BTC halving, where the community comes together and votes on whether to halve the supply again. This fosters community engagement and alignment at a set date in the future, creating a stable and predictable narrative similar to Bitcoin.\n\n## Final remarks \n\nAfter posting the WFC, I will post on my X.com account [@Josiahkotzur1](https://x.com/JosiahKotzur1) and pin it to my profile. I humbly ask all voters to share this, whether it is Aye or Nay, so the whole ecosystem can vote on the topic and determine the outcome of this WFC.\n\nRegards,\nJosiah\n",

      "content": "As we mark the milestone of our 1000th referendum, let's take a moment to celebrate and cherish the strengths of Polkadot, and collectively wish for their continued endurance. Our passionate community, the world's largest DAO, and our groundbreaking technology have always set us apart. In the spirit of Polkadot 2.0 and on the cusp of the network’s new website launch, we honor the core values that make Polkadot truly exceptional: true decentralization, which empowers every DOT holder to have a say in shaping the network; a vibrant community of developers, projects, and passionate users; and a legacy of trailblazing innovation that is always one step ahead. This huge milestone is a perfect opportunity to invite the rest of the cryptosphere to explore all the Polkadot has to offer, and to become active participants in our community. -Distractive Crew P.s. it was fun to see you all at Decoded - https://x.com/Polkadot/status/1813210880567296059",

      "content": "There is the risk that in future an excessive amount of treasury funds may be directed towards mythical. While it is obvious that the partnership between Polkadot and mythical is extremely beneficial to both parties, allowing mythical to process a number of transactions that would be impossible on any other chain and allowing Polkadot to showcase its technical prowess we also have to remain open to many other future partnerships and not exclusively focus on mythical. Mythical will already receive 1 million DOT from treasury in exchange for an airdrop of mythical token. This is of course great for both parties to solidify a winning partnership. However if we want to become the biggest platform for games we also have to be welcoming to other games, that's why Games Bounty \\[38\\] was created. I think it is important in order to allow fair competition and multiple opportunities to ensure that games bounty is not going to be used to fund activities related to mythical but instead focus on other games so that we can welcome diversity and competition. The request of this referendum is that the curators of Bounty 38 should not be allowed to fund anything related to mythical for the reasons I explained above",

      "title": "Proposing The Polkadot Tooling Collective",
      "content": "# Polkadot Tooling Collective\n\nThis document proposes to the Polkadot token holders the inception of a new System Collective: The Polkadot Tooling Collective (PoToC).\n\nAfter a formation period to establish members and display effectiveness, the collective will request funds from the treasury to support a salary structure and sub-treasury. These ideas are laid out in the `Phases` section.\n\n## Context\n\nThe Polkadot Core Fellowship is currently the only System Collective for developers. This makes it the go-to spot for new developers who want to join Polkadot - regardless of the field in which they want to work.\n\nThe scope of the Core Fellowship is rather narrow, focusing primarily on implementations of the Polkadot Host and runtime code. But many developers are working on tools related to making Polkadot successful, both the maintenance and development of the core protocol and the libraries and abstractions for dApp developers. These developers often find that their contributions are not recognized within the mandate of the Core Fellowship.\n\nBut the system can host many collectives. The Core Fellowship should be just one of many Collectives that serve Polkadot in different ways. Each has its own set of members, scope, and expertise levels.\n\nHaving a narrow scope is critical for a Collective to ensure that it can fulfill its mission. Widening the scope leads to a softening of its direction and social cohesion and possibly a loss of vision.\n\nThe Polkadot Tooling Collective will serve Polkadot by recognizing and retaining developers who make significant contributions to tools and libraries that make Polkadot easier to maintain, use, and integrate.\n\n## The Mission\n\nThe Polkadot Tooling Collective acts in the best interest of Polkadot. It tries to have a positive impact on developer success in the Polkadot Ecosystem and intends to do this by working towards two main goals:\n\n- To maintain developer tools to build dApps on Polkadot (dApp Tooling)\n- To maintain developer tools to build on Polkadot in general (General Tooling)\n\nSince these definitions are not sufficiently precise, an exhaustive *Mission List* is provided by PoToC. This *Mission List* is the only source of truth about its mission.\n\nSimilar to the Core Fellowship, one of PoToC's goals is to recognize and retain developers who make substantial contributions to these areas. Specifically, the collective should focus on people who have contributed to the specification or implementation of Polkadot tooling. Having an on-chain body will provide a means for these developers to align and organize. \n\nPoToC may want to apply for treasury funding in the future; it is therefore clear that any infringement upon its mission statement must be treated as an attempt to exfiltrate governance funds.\n\n## Mission List\n\nThe [*Mission List*](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/collective/blob/master/mission_list.md) contains all projects and services that are maintained by PoToC.\n\nIt is divided into two sections, solely to keep the requirements of each section clearly defined; *dApp* and *General*. It can be updated through an on-chain 2/3-majority rank-weighted vote across all Members.\n\nSome obvious cornerstones that must be upheld by all projects are:\n\n- Must be FOSS (Free and Open-Source Software).\n- Source code must be accessible without a login requirement.\n- All members of PoToC must have permission to propose changes and raise issues.\n\n### dApp Developer Tooling\n\nThis category contains all tools and libraries that help to build *on* Polkadot and are predominantly developed for this cause. Ideally, it should provide all pieces of software that are needed for a developer to build a dApp on Polkadot.\n\nIt specifically aims at developers - not end-users. Things like wallets, explorers, dashboards etc. are out of scope for this very cause.\n\nWe split this category into two layers:\n\n#### Fundamentals\n\nSoftware that lays the basis for a dApp project. They connect to the Polkadot network and offer rich possibilities to interact with it.  \nSome examples would be: sending transactions, subscribing to block headers or decoding and storage. \n\n- [Polkadot-JS API](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api)\n- [PAPI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot-api/substrate-client)\n- [SubXt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt)\n- [Substrate Connect](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-connect)\n- [asset-transfer-api](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api)\n- [asset-transfer-api-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api-registry)\n- [txwrapper-core](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core)\n- [Zondax/ledger-substrate-js](https://github.com/zondax/ledger-substrate-js)\n- [Scale TS](https://npmjs.com/package/scale-ts)\n- [scale-*](https://github.com/paritytech/scale-decode), [more](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/collective/blob/dd96bc056dfa47f0bc6a885c7afd25ed78345a11/join_request/jameswilson.yml#L26)\n\n#### Extensions\n\nSoftware in this tier depends on `Fundamentals` and extends their functionality. They may simplify and/or abstract certain functionality or tailor it to suite specific corner needs.\n\n- [Zombienet](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet) + [v2](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet-sdk)\n- [Chopsticks](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks)\n- [Polkadot UI](https://github.com/polkadot-ui/library)\n- [Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar)\n- [Polkadot-JS Tools](https://github.com/polkadot-js/tools)\n- [Subway](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/subway)\n- [virto SDK/libwallet](https://github.com/virto-network/virto-sdk/tree/main/libwallet)\n- [virto SDK/scales](https://github.com/virto-network/virto-sdk/tree/main/scales)\n- [virto SDK/sube](https://github.com/virto-network/virto-sdk/tree/main/sube)\n- [XCM Template](https://github.com/ltfschoen/XCMTemplate)\n\n### General Polkadot Tooling\n\nProjects that improve velocity and simplicity to develop on Polkadot. This category is not restricted to dApps, but can also include CLIs or similar.\n\n- [srtool](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool)\n- [subwasm](https://github.com/chevdor/subwasm)\n- [Zepter](https://github.com/ggwpez/zepter)\n- [OpenGov CLI](https://github.com/joepetrowski/opengov-cli)\n- [Substrate Weight Compare](https://github.com/ggwpez/substrate-weight-compare)\n\n## Structure\n\nThe initial structure shall be as minimalistic as possible, to limit maintenance and social drama. This has the downside of being less resilient against foreign takeovers, but in the beginning, I think it is fine to rather focus on social cohesion.\n\nThere is no differentiation between maintainers of \"Core Tooling\" and \"dApp Tooling\". They both share the same set of members and rank structure. These terms are only used to clarify the mission goal.\n\n### Rank 0 - Candidate\n\nDevelopers who want to join can be inducted by any Member into this rank. A vote for promotion to rank 1 can be started not earlier than six months after being inducted.\n\nThey are expected to be a maintainer for one of the tools on the mission list.\n\n- Voting weight: 0\n- Salary multiplier: task-based bounties\n\n### Rank 1 - Member\n\nMembers are expected to keep up the maintenance of at least one tool from the mission list. This includes extending them and creating new tools that are needed by the Polkadot developer community.\n\n- Voting weight: 1\n- Salary multiplier: 0.1 + task-based bounties\n\n### Further Ranks\n\nThe initial member seeding will show how many ranks need to be created to arrive at the correct granularity. The requirement for adding new ranks is that they are *absolutely necessary*.\n\nWe do not want to end in a situation where ranks are purely added to show off.\n\n## Salary Structure\n\nThere is no initial salary or bonus structure. In the future, after PoToC proves itself worthy, it is proposed to set up a bounty-centered pay structure.\n\nDifferent tiers of bounties shall be defined, and a fairly low baseline salary will be paid to all members. This is done to provide an incentive for improving the tooling instead of sloth.\n\nA member may apply for a specific bounty while providing evidence of fulfilling the bounty requirements. Granting of a bounty will be decided upon by a 50% on-chain vote. A cap on the monthly bounty payout should be established to prevent runaway spending and prioritize important changes. Bounty votes may only commence once per month to ease coordination between the Members.\n\nThe exact constants for the size of the bounties and baseline salary will be proposed through a secondary document in `Phase II`.\n\n## Initial Members\n\nThere shall be a [seeding repository](https://github.com/polkadot-tooling-collective/collective/pulls) that allows anyone to apply to a rank. Applications should include a list of tools and contributions that show their past commitment to Polkadot tooling development. The applicant must justify why they are a good fit to join PoToC.\n\nRanks have not been assigned yet, as there may be changes to their structure upon further review. However, the initial set of members was determined to be:\n\n| Name | github | Address |\n|------|------|---------| \n| Alberto Nicolás Penayo | bee344 | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/151S1YrZd4zfUYCeWhNERkGdmom8kdqAtRqtHwh9HYMTfFYJ'>151S1YrZ..</a> |\n| Bryan | xlc | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/14DsLzVyTUTDMm2eP3czwPbH53KgqnQRp3CJJZS9GR7yxGDP'>14DsLzVy..</a> |\n| Carlo Sala | carlosala | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/16JskuojL6mSp6HNcjiHYa9jqksWbLD8L9YGWU1ppiPWQ9sa'>16Jskuoj..</a> |\n| Daniel Olano | olanod | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/15oLanodWWweiZJSoDTEBtrX7oGfq6e8ct5y5E6fVRDPhUgj'>15oLanod..</a> |\n| Ermal Kaleci | ermalkaleci | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/14iKbZws1fjJ6TH27yoRq6KeeVNof83VmxUBN2W2udQVBe5o'>14iKbZws..</a> |\n| James Wilson | jsdw | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/12TNvHiRkwzYqT5UZ86cfUvBeZBjLLYUzHLa4Hix99oTrgqT'>12TNvHiR..</a> |\n| Javier Viola | pepoviola | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/12W3ea6jWKhzSWSCMjUKqtDwasRACeYFGkyvVb9Y9b5dGm2v'>12W3ea6j..</a> |\n| Josep M Sobrepere | josepot | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/15roJ4ZrgrZam5BQWJgiGHpgp7ShFQBRNLq6qUfiNqXDZjMK'>15roJ4Zr..</a> |\n| Joseph Petrowski | joepetrowski | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/15DCWHQknBjc5YPFoVj8Pn2KoqrqYywJJ95BYNYJ4Fj3NLqz'>15DCWHQk..</a> |\n| Nikolaos Kontakis | wirednkod | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/15DCZocYEM2ThYCAj22QE4QENRvUNVrDtoLBVbCm5x4EQncr'>15DCZocY..</a> |\n| Oliver Tale-Yazdi | ggwpez | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/16a357f5Sxab3V2ne4emGQvqJaCLeYpTMx3TCjnQhmJQ71DX'>16a357f5..</a> |\n| Tarik Gul | TarikGul | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/13ogXJ1tpHZoaav2iQQRDH5eHcvpAEfwB1UFY6dijDBmDcic'>13ogXJ1t..</a> |\n| Victor Oliva Vidal | voliva | <a target='_blank' href='https://collectives.statescan.io/#/accounts/16JGzEsi8gcySKjpmxHVrkLTHdFHodRepEz8n244gNZpr9J'>16JGzEsi..</a> |\n\n## Future\n\nThere are a lot of questions unanswered by this document. In the beginning, we will use the Core Fellowship as a guiding light for processes and ethics as much as possible. Eventually, PoToC would develop its sub-culture (pun intended) and show more of its own identity.\n\nA rough mid-term plan could look like this:\n\n### Phase I - Setup\n\nThis phase is for setting everything up and getting it enacted on-chain. It should take at most 6 months.\n\n- 1.1 Contacting all stakeholders: Token holders, Seeding members, and The Fellowship.\n- 1.2 Pitching the proposal to the community and incorporating feedback. \n- 2.1 Crafting a preliminary implementation to ensure that all important parameters are mentioned in the proposal.\n- 2.2 Binding governance vote via Wish-For-Change track. This is treated as the final signal on whether to pursue it or not.\n- 3.1 Final implementation and approval by The Fellowship.\n- 3.2 Enactment on-chain and beginning of operations.\n\n## Phase II - Probation Period\n\nPoToC starts operating in a risk-reduced mode without governance funding. This phase will be used to evaluate the effectiveness and impact of PoToC.\n\nHopefully, the general public will deem it useful and approve of its future funding requests.\n\nThis phase should take from 6 months to 1 year.\n\n## Phase III - Business As Usual\n\nPoToC enacts its salary structure. The creation and granting of bounties starts and attracts new developer talent.\n\nThis will demonstrate that creating a System Collective can be done by anyone, and hopefully inspire the wider community to further its decentralization efforts in that direction.\n",

We have also seen how sometimes even another Top up is requested after having launched a first one so we see that asking for the Top up with the DOT token is NOT VIABLE.\nThat is why I think it would be better for the community that these Top ups are done in USDT/USDC stables.\n\nCurrently we have these referendums in progress to apply for a TOP UP, the price od DOT it´s 5.60$ so we will see new

these top ups?\n\nPerhaps content creators can carry out work and requesting their top up does not paralyze their activity in the long term, but large events could be harmed, or exaggeratedly large proposals or new users, we can fulfill this social contract by doing part of the work with the financing and then ask for that top up\n\nMaybe it's easier to know when NOT to give this top up\n- Bad strategy of the funds?\n-Changes after approval regarding the initial idea of ​​the referendum?...\nThese are just ideas and I would like to hear from the community...\n\nPlease do not see this as an attack on the proponents but as a measure in the face of price variation and take an example from the[ ref 831](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/831)\n\n**ES**\n\nEstablecer una norma para “top up ” \n\ncomprender la propuesta desde la recarga por causa de la variación del precio del token Dot..\n\nDurante el último mes hemos visto un gran cantidad de este tipo de propuestas, por lo que he visto en Polkadot mayormente en las propuestas como comunidad hemos cumplido el contrato social de los top up debido al cambio del precio del token DOT en negativo. hemos visto así mismo como en ocasiones se pide incluso otro Top up después de haber lanzado un primero por lo que vemos que pedir el Top up con el token de de DOT NO ES VIABLE\nEs por eso que considero que sería mejor para la comunidad que estos Top up se realicen en stables USDT/USDC\n\nActualmente tenemos estos referendums en curso para solicitar un TOP UP .el precio de DOT es 5.60$ entonces veremos nuevas recargas……..?\n\nhttps://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/883\nInitial request   $485,000 with the day's EMA7 of $9.544\nsecond request  25.000DOT   —$6.38 which is a total of 21,155.64 DOT for

exageradamente grandes o nuevos usuarios podemos cumplir este contrato social hacien do parte del trabajo con la financiación y luego pedir ese top up\n\nQuizas en más fácil saber cunaod NO dar este

      "title": "Should we allow EVM compatible contracts on Asset Hub?",
      "content": "# Should we allow EVM compatible contracts on Asset Hub?\n\n## Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to find out if there is token holder support for adding a smart contract execution environment to Polkadot’s Asset Hub system parachain.\n\nIf approved, we are targeting a deployment by the end of 2024: the proposed solution currently in development at Parity would not use the existing [Frontier technology](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier) and instead would be based on [pallet-contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/contracts), [PolkaVM](https://github.com/koute/polkavm) ([\\[1\\]](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/exploring-alternatives-to-wasm-for-smart-contracts/2434), [\\[2\\]](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/announcing-polkavm-a-new-risc-v-based-vm-for-smart-contracts-and-possibly-more/3811)) and an [EVM to PolkaVM recompiler](https://github.com/xermicus/revive) ([\\[3\\]](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/contracts-update-solidity-on-polkavm/6949)) for Solidity/EVM compatibility. See below to understand why it matters.\n\n## Motivation\n\n#### Allow for synchronous and permissionless interactions with assets\n\nThe Asset Hub parachain is the designated place to hold assets within the Polkadot ecosystem. Many blockchain applications rely on having ergonomic and secure access to those assets.\n\nToday, there are two permissionless ways in which on-chain logic can be developed and deployed on Polkadot to engage with Asset Hub assets.\n\n1. Develop functionality with Polkadot SDK and deploy as a parachain that transacts with Asset Hub via XCM in an asynchronous fashion.\n2. Develop functionality with Solidity or ink! and deploy on a parachain with Frontier or pallet-contracts smart contract execution environment (e.g. Moonbeam, Astar, etc.) that transacts with Asset Hub via XCM in an asynchronous fashion.\n\nIn both cases:\n\n- The communication and complexity overhead of dealing with assets on another chain has to be paid.\n- Another token, governance system or at least brand is involved when developing an application.\n\nHence we suggest allowing deployment of contracts directly to Asset Hub. By allowing all assets in pallet_asset available to contracts, contracts then won’t have to deal with asynchronous operations. We will emulate one ERC20 contract for each asset within pallet_assets to make this operation ergonomic for Solidity developers.\n\nRefer to the following table to compare the different ways of deploying to Polkadot:\n\n|     | **Composability w/ assets on AH** | **Permissionless deployment?** | **Ease of development** | **Subject to Governance system & brand** | **DOT as fee-paying asset** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adding a pallet to AH | Synchronous | No, requires approval of Polkadot governance | Hard | Only Polkadot governance & brand | Yes |\n| Smart Contracts on non-system (“3rd party”) parachain (i.e. Moonbeam) | Asynchronous via XCM | Yes (generally) | Easy | Parachain governance & brand | Currently no |\n| New non-system (“3rd party”) parachain | Asynchronous via XCM | Yes | Hard | Parachain governance & brand | Possible |\n| Smart Contracts on dedicated Smart Contracts system parachain | Asynchronous via XCM | Yes | Easy | Only Polkadot governance & brand | Yes |\n| **Smart Contracts on AH** | Synchronous | Yes | Easy | Only Polkadot governance & brand | Yes |\n\n####\n\nSmart contracts are easier/cheaper to build & deploy than a parachain. Requiring businesses to learn a new technology (Rust + PolkadotSDK) is a significant hurdle, whereas\n\nSolidity is the most widely adopted and supported smart contract language.\n\nSolidity is the industry standard. Requiring businesses to learn a new technology (Rust + PolkadotSDK) is a big ask. If it doesn’t work out the investment is lost. By supporting Solidity we make sure that deploying to Polkadot is a low risk endeavor.\n\n#### Frontier _vs_. PolkaVM\n\nFrontier will never reach the near native execution speeds that we aim for. [Early benchmarks show](https://hackmd.io/@XXX9CM1uSSCWVNFRYaSB5g/HJarTUhJA) that the solution in development is capable of reaching those speeds. Additionally, by using PolkaVM, additional languages (like C or Rust) can be used to unlock even more performance when needed. For example, highly optimized cryptography written in C can be integrated into a Solidity contract.\n\nPolkaVM & [EVM to PolkaVM recompiler](https://github.com/xermicus/revive) can provide significant performance improvements over existing Polkadot smart contract execution environments (Frontier and pallet-contracts)\n\nNote that we can’t just deploy Frontier now and move to the new technology later. Minor differences prevent an automatic migration. This means we would need to support Frontier forever, which we would like to avoid.\n\n#### The EVM to PolkaVM recompiler can be reused for JAM\n\nWe believe that we probably also want to run Solidity contracts directly on top of JAM. The [technology developed as part of this effort](https://github.com/xermicus/revive) can be re-used to accomplish this.\n\n#### We can create a dedicated system chain later if required\n\nShould availability of blockspace on Asset Hub become a bottleneck (good problem to have) Polkadot could decide to spawn a dedicated contracts system chain. In which case projects that have already deployed their smart contracts on Asset Hub would be incentivized to migrate their Dapp in order to save on transaction costs. **Starting** with a dedicated chain will just be an Asset Hub with contracts and hence driving fragmentation without providing value as we have enough block space right now.\n\n## Reasons not to\n\n#### Increases the complexity of Asset Hub\n\nAdding a major piece of software to any system chain will increase its complexity and maintenance burden.\n\n#### Binds some of Parity’s development resources\n\nDeveloping this solution will naturally bind development resources that can’t be used to develop other things.\n\n#### Could lead to competition for existing smart contract parachains\n\nParachains already offering a full fledged smart contract execution environment may experience competitive pressure due to Asset Hub’s ability to host smart contracts.\n\n## We need the community as Partners\n\nParity will only provide the core technology:\n\n1. A YUL to PolkaVM recompiler\n2. An execution environment (a pallet + required host functions) targeted by said recompiler\n3. A compatibility layer that translates Ethereum RPCs to Polkadot RPCs (similar to Frontier)\n4. Integration of above into the Asset Hub runtime\n\nThis is why we need a community to provide all the rest that is needed for success. If an EVM instance is accepted into the Polkadot protocol via Asset Hub and/or another system chain, one would expect the Treasury or Fellowship to fund projects that contribute to its success. This is a non exhaustive things that we think we need:\n\n#### Tooling and Integration\n\nThe Ethereum RPC compatibility layer will bring us 95% of the way of supporting existing EVM tooling and integrations. But making sure that things actually work with a good developer experience is another story. Somebody needs to make sure Polkadot pops up in [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), make sure that block explorers work, and find out where we lack compatibility.\n\n#### Marketing\n\nWe need people to spread the word and bring new users in. Being Ethereum but with fast code execution makes it a much simpler sales pitch.\n\n#### Communication\n\nWe need people that handle the communication between core developers and builders, who find out which pieces are missing and where we need to improve.\n\n#### Education\n\nWhile the system will work mostly like Ethereum there will be minor differences in functionality and major differences in performance characteristics. We need people writing tutorials, doing bootcamps, and answering questions.\n\n#### Liquidity from Ethereum\n\nThis system will only be useful for most people if there is enough liquidity available. We will make sure that existing liquidity on Asset Hub is available to contracts. However, we need people to come up with smart ways to bring in more.\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### In which milestones will this be rolled out?\n\nIn two milestones: The first milestone is planned to be rolled out at the end of this year. This will include the fully functional products mentioned above but in an unoptimized form. This means that we will be executing contracts with an in-runtime PolkaVM interpreter. This is a huge simplification since it does not require any changes to the node.\n\nAs a second milestone we will allow contracts to be just in time compiled, unlocking all the performance benefits without any changes to already deployed contracts.\n\n#### Can we deploy something quickly earlier (1-3 months) and then iterate?\n\nThe only Ethereum compatible software we have right now is pallet_evm and Acala’s EVM+. However, deploying them now means that we need to support both solutions forever since there is no automatic migration path. Contracts are immutable code, which means the execution environment needs to be backwards compatible forever. This means that the MVP needs to get all the fundamentals right which will take time.",

Maximum supply is fixed (by definition) — addresses fears of overdilution\n2. No reduction of rewards in the first year — no immediate selling pressure from yield investors \n3. JAM launch until first supply reduction a year from now seems possible — reinforcing the message to investors\n4. The odds of a favorable crypto macro environment a year from now seem to be in favor\n5. Gavin stated there would be a safety mechanism to increase the supply if necessary, due to it being too aggressive, via a hard fork\n\nGavin's idea creates fiscal certainty and predictability with regard to the DOT supply, along with less unintended consequences.\n\nQuestion: \nWhy was Gavin's pi * billion figure not followed?\n\nAnswer: \nGavin suggested the timing be for next year and pi * billion, as 50% (1.57 billion) would be the approx supply at the time, so no reduction of rewards in the first year.\n\nThis proposal requests that the change be made this year instead, and the slightly reduced max supply (2.91 instead of 3.14) will also mean no reduction of rewards in the first year (2.91 billion * 50% = 1.455 billion remaining * 10% = 145 million inflation).\n\nOf course this is just a wish for change ref, so is a way for the community to show their support or not, for Gavin's idea.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy, in your opinion, the change should start this year?\n\nAnswer:\nThis wish for change is that we don't need to wait until next year. I feel the sooner the max supply is fixed the better, as per the proposal description, including fiscal certainty and addressing fears of overdilution, and no reduction in rewards the first year.\n\nQuestion:\nWhy with slight different values?\n\nAnswer:\nPi * 1 billion works perfectly if it's implemented mid next year (Gavin's timing), when the supply would be approx half at 1.57 billion, so again no reduction in rewards the first year.\n\nIf we were to use the same max supply this year, then the inflation would be a greater amount. Eg. 3.14 billion - 1.455 billion = 1.685 billion * 10% = 168.5 million inflation (instead of 145 million).",

      "title": "Pilot MOU Proposal for a Collaboration between the Polkadot Ecosystem and the Founder Institute:",
      "content": "In the summer of 2023, Mr. [Laurent Koehler,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lkoehler81/) the Co-Director of the Founder Institute in Hong Kong, discussed his plans to launch a Web3 vertical in 2024 with me. His goal was to enhance business offerings for investors and applicants. As a growth Web3 Advisor at my company BQ9 and an active member of the Polkadot community, I found his vision particularly compelling. This prompted me to explore the unique opportunities it could present for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Consequently, we began holding regular meetings where I contributed insights to help shape the program and evaluate the benefits of integrating with the Polkadot ecosystem. On March 15, 2024, Mr. Koehler and I formalized our collaboration, leading the Founder Institute to issue a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Polkadot to onboard mentors and develop joint co-marketing initiatives.\n\n\\*\\*Timing: \\*\\*We are living in crucial times for our industry towards mass adoption, and our initiatives are designed to help new startup founders learn about Polkadot's technology and its ecosystem, encouraging them to develop their projects within it. Given the nature of the Founder Institute, this collaboration is strategic and will enable the Polkadot ecosystem to gain essential exposure to new companies and projects, investors' networks, and to establish a presence and raise awareness within the Founder Institute network.\n\n\\*\\*Relevance: \\*\\*The Founder Institute is recognized as the world's largest pre-seed startup accelerator. Founded in 2009 by Adeo Ressi and Jonathan Greechan, it was initially designed to provide early-stage startups with the structured process, feedback, and support network needed to succeed, which many entrepreneurs lacked at the time. This initiative started in Silicon Valley but quickly expanded globally due to high demand, now operating in over 200 cities and localized in nine languages​. To date, the Founder Institute's alumni have raised over $1.75 billion in funding, and the estimated portfolio value of these companies exceeds $30 billion. Beyond initial startup acceleration, the Founder Institute also supports ongoing growth through post-program benefits like introductions to potential partners and investors. They maintain a robust network of over 35,000 mentors and advisors to assist in various aspects of business development​.​ ([The Founder Institute](https://fi.co/))​.\n\n**First-Mover Advantage:** The Founder Institute is set to launch its very first Web3 cohort within its Core Program, signifying a landmark expansion into the field of Web3. This inaugural cohort, which begins on May 28, 2024, and concludes on September 3, 2024, represents a significant milestone in the Institute’s history. It will be hosted by the Hong Kong Chapter. This new track will delve key verticals of the Web3 domain and will feature guidance from esteemed mentors within the Web3.0. Polkadot will be a key program partner in the Founder Institute's historic first Web3 cohort, bringing support from its network of distinguished experts from the Polkadot Ecosystem. To inaugurate this chapter with them gives the first-mover advantage to our ecosystem.\n\n\\*\\*Founder Institute Responsibilities. \\*\\*Founder Institute shall undertake the following activities:\n\n-   Provide online and onsite branding for Partner on the website for the FII Program\n-   Introduce all enrolled founders in the Program to Partner Provide up to two (2) mentor slots for Partner as a mentor in the Program\n-   Allow Partner to present at any desired session to all enrolled founders during the Program Email\n-   Partner special offer to all enrolled founders in the Program (optional)\n\n**Polkadot, Responsibilities**. Polkadot shall undertake the following activities:\n\n-   Recommend a mentor(s) from the ecosystem\n-   Present at the required program session(s) during the FII Program\n-   Provide any marketing collateral necessary and required by FII to use as branding on the website(s) for the FII Program\n-   Create a special offer for all enrolled founders in the Program (optional)\n\nAs previously mentioned, representatives from the Polkadot ecosystem will participate in the inaugural Web3 cohort from **May 28, 2024, to September 3, 2024**. However, our collaboration does not end there, since we will continue to recruit additional mentors for subsequent cohorts. Our goal is to understand the types of support founders seek from the Polkadot ecosystem and the innovative solutions they plan to introduce. We will use the insights gained from the first cohort to refine and enhance our engagement with the Founder Institute going forward.\n\n**_Using this post on OpenGov as an MOU between Founder Institute & Polkadot._**\n\n[MOU between Polkadot Ecosystem & Founder Institute](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GI5UTYxZjD8JhqYcVhETZCPbd5sKNsaQ/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nAn MOU often serves as a formal agreement between parties, outlining their roles and responsibilities. However, since Polkadot is a decentralized software and needs to be supported by its community this MOU will be considered a liabilities exempt Pilot Project between the parties.. Consequently, Facilitators and Focal Points will perform to support the parties and will act free of liabilities as well. This method will ensure transparency and accessibility to all stakeholders within the community. [Irina Karagyar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irina-karagyaur/), as a Polkadot Head Ambassador, as a representative, will sign the MOU posted on OpenGov only symbolically on behalf of Polkadot. This ensures that the agreement aligns with community decisions and the decentralized ethos of Polkadot. By following these steps, the MOU becomes a roadmap document, formalizing the agreement between Polkadot (represented by the Ambassador) and the Founder Institute.\n\n![](https://example.com/your-image.png)![](https://i.ibb.co/55MzcFk/FI-Polkadot-X-post.png)\n\n[https://fi.co/insight/the-founder-institute-launches-its-first-hong-kong-web3-accelerator-in-collaboration-with-polkadot](https://fi.co/insight/the-founder-institute-launches-its-first-hong-kong-web3-accelerator-in-collaboration-with-polkadot)\n\nAn overview of the Founder Institute: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBHc\\_3NgUo4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBHc_3NgUo4)\n\nMOU:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/pRTxR7K/MOU-Polkadot-Signed-FI-BQ9-1-images-0.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Bz3x3Lc/MOU-Polkadot-Signed-FI-BQ9-1-images-1.jpg)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/ckDWbHJ/MOU-Polkadot-Signed-FI-BQ9-1-images-2.jpg)\n\nFor any further questions and collaboration opportunities, please do not hesitate to contact Irina Karagyuar, Co-Founder & CEO BQ9, Ecosystem Growth Agency,  irina@bq9.io",

          "content": "In the summer of 2023, Mr. [Laurent Koehler,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lkoehler81/) the Co-Director of the Founder Institute in Hong Kong, discussed his plans to launch a Web3 vertical in 2024 with me. His goal was to enhance business offerings for investors and applicants. As a growth Web3 Advisor at my company BQ9 and an active member of the Polkadot community, I found his vision particularly compelling. This prompted me to explore the unique opportunities it could present for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. Consequently, we began holding regular meetings where I contributed insights to help shape the program and evaluate the benefits of integrating with the Polkadot ecosystem. On March 15, 2024, Mr. Koehler and I formalized our collaboration, leading the Founder Institute to issue a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for Polkadot to onboard mentors and develop joint co-marketing initiatives.\n\n**Timing:** We are living in crucial times for our industry towards mass adoption, and our initiatives are designed to help new startup founders learn about Polkadot's technology and its ecosystem, encouraging them to develop their projects within it. Given the nature of the Founder Institute, this collaboration is strategic and will enable the Polkadot ecosystem to gain essential exposure to new companies and projects, investors' networks, and to establish a presence and raise awareness within the Founder Institute network.\n\n**Relevance:** The Founder Institute is recognized as the world's largest pre-seed startup accelerator. Founded in 2009 by Adeo Ressi and Jonathan Greechan, it was initially designed to provide early-stage startups with the structured process, feedback, and support network needed to succeed, which many entrepreneurs lacked at the time. This initiative started in Silicon Valley but quickly expanded globally due to high demand, now operating in over 200 cities and localized in nine languages​. To date, the Founder Institute's alumni have raised over $1.75 billion in funding, and the estimated portfolio value of these companies exceeds $30 billion. Beyond initial startup acceleration, the Founder Institute also supports ongoing growth through post-program benefits like introductions to potential partners and investors. They maintain a robust network of over 35,000 mentors and advisors to assist in various aspects of business development​.​ ([The Founder Institute](https://fi.co/))​.\n\n**First-Mover Advantage:** The Founder Institute is set to launch its very first Web3 cohort within its Core Program, signifying a landmark expansion into the field of Web3. This inaugural cohort, which begins on May 28, 2024, and concludes on September 3, 2024, represents a significant milestone in the Institute’s history. It will be hosted by the Hong Kong Chapter. This new track will delve key verticals of the Web3 domain and will feature guidance from esteemed mentors within the Web3.0. Polkadot will be a key program partner in the Founder Institute's historic first Web3 cohort, bringing support from its network of distinguished experts from the Polkadot Ecosystem. To inaugurate this chapter with them gives the first-mover advantage to our ecosystem.\n\n  \n**Founder Institute Responsibilities.** Founder Institute shall undertake the following activities:\n\n-   Provide online and onsite branding for Partner on the website for the FII Program\n-   Introduce all enrolled founders in the Program to Partner Provide up to two (2) mentor slots for Partner as a mentor in the Program\n-   Allow Partner to present at any desired session to all enrolled founders during the Program Email\n-   Partner special offer to all enrolled founders in the Program (optional)\n\n**Polkadot, Responsibilities**. Polkadot shall undertake the following activities:\n\n-   Recommend a mentor(s) from the ecosystem\n-   Present at the required program session(s) during the FII Program\n-   Provide any marketing collateral necessary and required by FII to use as branding on the website(s) for the FII Program\n-   Create a special offer for all enrolled founders in the Program (optional)\n\nAs previously mentioned, representatives from the Polkadot ecosystem will participate in the inaugural Web3 cohort from **May 28, 2024, to September 3, 2024**. However, our collaboration does not end there, since we will continue to recruit additional mentors for subsequent cohorts. Our goal is to understand the types of support founders seek from the Polkadot ecosystem and the innovative solutions they plan to introduce. We will use the insights gained from the first cohort to refine and enhance our engagement with the Founder Institute going forward.\n\n_**Using this post on OpenGov as an MOU between Founder Institute & Polkadot.**_\n\n[MOU between Polkadot Ecosystem & Founder Institute](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GI5UTYxZjD8JhqYcVhETZCPbd5sKNsaQ/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nAn MOU often serves as a formal agreement between parties, outlining their roles and responsibilities.

I understand that technically this may not be feasible (unless the brilliant minds within the fellowship can find a way to implement it) but even if it is not technically possible I think this could still act as a survey for the real DOT holders to express their opinion and that maybe W3F will listen It is my opinion that the real ultimate purpose of on chain governance is to minimize selling pressure, and not to achieve some sort of abstract socialist idea of fairness or equality Every time there is a contentious decision it is always better that the majority of the real DOT holders have their way compared to the minority because in the worst case scenario it's going to be the minority selling and not the majority so it is always the best interest of the ecosystem that the majority of the real DOT holders that have the power to sell get their way The only purpose of governance is to minimize selling pressure and nothing else in my opinion Based on that assumption even in case it is not possible to technically prevent DV (as technically those are DOT belonging to W3F so this is not a matter of referendum) this can serve as a survey to indicate to W3F what is the real desire of the real DOT holders (the ones that can potentially sell because they really own DOT) This referendum done on this track allows to discover the intention of real DOT holders and it excludes DV so we can really understand what the real DOT holders want By the way this is not about whales versus shrimps but it's about holders versus non-holders and capitalism versus socialism Let's hear the opinion of the real DOT holders",

      "content": "# Summary\n\nThis proposal aims to define Polkadot 2.0 as being scoped around the themes of Coretime.\n\nIf accepted, the first Polkadot runtime version that fully supports Agile Coretime, Async Backing, and Elastic Scaling will be the version considered Polkadot 2.0\n\n# Motivation\n\nGiving versions to software products primarily acts as an attention coordination mechanism. Major versions are typically assigned for significant improvements in the feature set of software (or significant breaking changes).\n\nAfter the delivery of Polkadot 2.0, attention in the developer and user community shifted towards what the next big evolutionary steps of Polkadot are going to be. Agile Coretime, as most notably publicly introduced by Gavin Wood at Decoded 2023, was the first major focal point of public attention and quickly became referred to by many as Polkadot 2.0.\n\nThe only other major theme next to Coretime-related development effort is JAM, which is still in research and with a yet unclear delivery timeline. It is more suitable for a future major version.\n\nIt is the opinion of the stakeholders voting AYE on this proposal that Coretime is a significant evolution in the efficient allocation of Polkadot blockspace and should be marked as Polkadot 2.0.\n\nSpecifically, we consider 3 epic features to be part of this development track:\n- Agile Coretime, which is the ability to acquire bulk and on-demand coretime and dynamically allocate it to parachains\n- Async Backing, which allows parachains to submit parablocks for inclusion into the Polkadot relay chain more flexibly\n- Elastic Scaling, which will allow parachains to consume more than one core if they need additional resources\n\n# Instructions\n\nIf accepted, this proposal instructs the Polkadot Technical Fellowship and any other actor that respects this proposal to declare the first Polkadot runtime version that supports all of the three described features as Polkadot 2.0.\n\nSince the exact definition of the circumstances and implementation of those features is complex, subject to change, and intersubjective, it is up to the Technical Fellowship to apply its best judgment on what constitutes the delivery of the features.",

      "content": "Changing the curves of the referendums that were affected by extended confirmation periods: Since the confirmation period was extended to 7 days it can be used as an opportunity for people to snipe vote no against a referendum during confirmation and basically abort it without giving it time for other people to vote in favor. This problem was less apparent when the confirmation period was 24 hours because the window of opportunity for sniping a no was much shorter. The reason confirmation period should exist is simply to avoid people waiting the last day of the referendum to vote yes to basically snipe a yes since 24 hours is a short time and some people may not notice and not vote against in time. The problem is that 7 days confirmation while being a useful protection against yes sniping becomes an opportunity for no sniping. It also slows down the process of the referendum even more than it was before. I think the right procedure should be to adjust the curves to account for the new extended confirmation. So instead of being able to pass with just 50%+ and any amount of support on day 28th this should happen on day 21 so that it can enter into confirmation on day 21 in the worst case scenario and then the 7 days of confirmation cannot be used for sniping because even if it is aborted the timer is still running until day 28 allowing people to then vote yes instead of aborting permanently The same should be done for medium spender where the confirmation now stands at 4 days so on day 24 of the curve the level of support required should be zero and the threshold should be just about 50%+ so that the last 4 days of confirmation overlap with the last 4 days of the 28 days period",

It takes up to 28 days for a referendum to pass, then you have to add 7 days confirmation and if let's assume the confirmation ends on the first day of a new spending period you have to wait another 24 days. From what I've heard this choice of 24 days is completely arbitrary but it seems to create a lot of problems because it takes like 2 months to receive funds from when a referendum is initiated if you're unlucky with the spending period. So why create this extra uncertainty? I would suggest to reduce the spending period to the shortest possible time, if it's one day it's great, if it's not possible maybe to 1 week? The shorter the better of course whatever is technically feasible",

      "title": "Approve the Polkadot EVM Collective",
      "content": "# Polkadot EVM Collective\n\nThe Polkadot EVM collective is a planned on-chain technical collective that\ndeals with everything related to EVM. It is similar to the fellowship program,\nwith the topic of EVM, instead of core runtime.\n\nThere are four goals of this collective. It is first and foremost a\nstandardization body that will be in charge of its own RFC process. It wants to\nprovide transparency over the development and maintenance of various tools that\nthe ecosystem uses. It also tries to create an inclusive roadmap with the aim\nof reconcile different needs. And finally, it provides expert opinions to those\nwho need them. We'll discuss the four goals in more details in the following\nsections.\n\nThe discussion of an on-chain Polkadot EVM collective has been under way during\nthe early days of Frontier development. During the last few months, especially\nduring Parity's \"decentralization\", we increasingly see the need of an on-chain\ncollective as the Frontier project moves independent. The recent \"OpenEVM\"\nmovement (credit to *Giotto*) heavily accelerated the process.\n\n## Goals\n\n### Standardization\n\nIn the context of Polkadot EVM, there are a number of Polkadot-specific\nmodifications we need to do. Polkadot EVM has custom precompiles as well as\ncustom gas metering logic. In the past, we have also seen some specific use\ncases that require custom transaction format or new opcodes. The Polkadot EVM\ncollective aims to create an RFC process to document them.\n\nA standardization process is important in certain modifications. The collective\nitself acts as a review and audit body to help discover various security issues\nin the specifications. It also helps to improve interoperability across\nparachains, as eventually we want to have contracts on different parachains\ntalking with each other freely.\n\n### Development and maintenance\n\nThe collective aims to bring more transparency over the development and\nmaintenance of various tools that the ecosystem uses. We aim to link the\nmembership of the EVM collective with the membership and merge rights in the\n[polkadot-evm](https://github.com/polkadot-evm) Github organization. It\ntherefore becomes clear who is responsible for the maintenance and who can merge\nPRs. It avoids single-point-of-failure if one person is temporarily not available.\nIt also helps in the situation that some technical differences between different\nmembers are non-conciliable (but hopefully we never come to that point).\n\n### Roadmap\n\nDuring the past few years when working on the Frontier project, I've seen, at\nfirst hand, the vast different opinions on how the Polkadot community should\nwork with EVM development. And I'm afraid to say, that it is still the case at\nthis moment, that there's a big disconnect between the core development team,\nand the parachain ecosystem. While those are purely different technical views,\nthey have vast influence on how subsequently the ecosystem develops tools and\nuse contracts.\n\nShould the EVM interpreter be on-chain or should EVM contracts be off-chain\ncompiled first? How strict should we treat EVM compatibility? What is the\ntimeline of EVM? Should we support EVM indefinitely, or is it purely there to\nprovide a migration path to WASM/RISC-V?\n\nSuch issues have big impact over dapp developers. If they develop on Polkadot,\nwe want to make sure they have certainty over what they may have and not have in\nthe near future, so that they know that whatever tools they developed wouldn't\nbe made obsolete by the core dev team. The Polkadot EVM collective aims to\nprovide a discussion platform that can provide some certainty.\n\nWe also deal with bigger issue in the roadmap, such as the migration of a\ncomplete Ethereum blockchain over to Polkadot. (Yes, this is possible and\ntechnically a planned feature in Frontier.)\n\n### Expert opinions\n\nThe Polkadot EVM collective also aims to provide expert opinions and help in\nreview, audit, and coordinate certain ecosystem initiatives. For example, the\ncollective may be in charge to draft the detailed technical requirements for the\nnew \"OpenEVM\" parachain and supervise its implementation. For this, we currently\ndon't expect the collective to handle anything related to code implementation.\nIt will likely be decided through a tendering process via a treasury referendum,\nand developed by an external team who wins the bid.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe scope of the collective is intentionally set to be specific and concrete in\norder to ensure a functional collaberation. One is eligible as a member of the\nPolkadot EVM collective if one is involved in the development of a tool or a\nparachain/solochain that has EVM feature.\n\nSee the [repository](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/seeding) for the\nupdated project list.\n\n## Membership\n\nThere are two aspects of the membership -- ranks and roles. Rank defines a member's\nvoting power within the collective. Role gives out ecosystem-specific permissions\nand responsibilities.\n\n### Rank\n\nThe EVM Collective uses a flat ranking system. We have two ranks.\n\n* **Junior members**. This corresponds to rank I. This is a member that is at least\n  somewhat involved in Polkadot EVM development.\n* **Senior members**. This corresponds to rank III. This is a member that is deeply\n  involved in Polkadot EVM development.\n\nThe ranks of a member define the member's voting power. Unlike the Fellowship\ncollective, rank does not determine a member's other privileges, such as any financial\nincentives. They are instead defined by \"roles\", which we explain in more\ndetails below.\n\n### Role\n\nRole defines a member's responsibilities within the collective. The collective is run\nunder the assumption that a member's contribution is correlated with the member's\ndevotion, not seniority. As a result, financial incentives (if any) is associated with\na role, but not with ranks. There are also no limitations on lower ranks with \"higher\"\nroles. A junior member might well have more financial incentives or other benefits,\nthan a senior member, if she or he contributes more.\n\nThe list of roles are dynamic. On-chain, the definition of a role contains only two\ninformation -- its index, and a shortname. Roles can be added or removed by changing\nthe runtime config, without runtime upgrades. The addition and removal of roles,\nand the granting and dismissing of roles of a member, is done by a majority vote of\nthe collective (respective to the member's voting power), or a referendum in OpenGov.\n\nThe initial list of roles will only be defined once the collective becomes active\non-chain, subject to all members' approvals. Below are examples of possible roles:\n\n* **RFC editor**: grants merge rights to the EVM RFC repository, responsible for\n  maintaining the RFC process.\n* **Frontier maintainer**: grants merge rights to the Frontier repository, responsible\n  for maintaining the Frontier project and making new releases.\n* **Other project maintainer roles**.\n* **Speaker of the collective**: responsible for publishing the collective's annual report\n  to the community and handle certain communications.\n* **Special task force roles**. For example, launching a community-driven EVM parachain.\n\n### Inactivity\n\nTo ensure that the collective is able to move forward and is not bloated with members of\ninactions, an inactivity check is utilized. We define the exact algorithm below. The gist of\nthe algorithm is that we require each member to rate whether they think that each other member\nis active. A member must receive at least 1/3 of the votes to continue to be considered active.\n\nThe checking period is every 24 weeks (roughly 6 months). During each period, a member is\nrequired to submit an on-chain extrinsic for inactivity check. The content of the extrinsic\nis a bitmap of all other members, where `1` represents that the member believes that the\nother member is active, and `0` otherwise. Repeated extrinsic submissions will override past\nones.\n\nAt the end of each checking period, the following is applied:\n\n* Set `N0` to be the total number of active members in the last checking period.\n* If a member did not submit any on-chain extrinsic, it is marked inactive.\n* All new inactive members are filtered out. Set `N1` to be the total number of new\n  (pending) active members.\n* Collect the bitmap of all submitted on-chain extrinsics. If the count of `1`s for a member\n  is greater than or equal to `N1 / 3` rounded down to the nearest integer, then it is set\n  as active. Otherwise, it is set as inactive.\n\nAn inactive member keeps its rank, but will not be able to vote and will not count towards\nthe required quorum. An inactive member will also have all of its roles set to inactive.\n\nThe meaning of each inactive role is defined by each role. Usually, this means that the member\nwill not have the privileges and responsibilities associated with the role.\n\nAn inactive member is moved back to the active list by either a majority vote of the collective,\nor by a Polkadot referendum.\n\n## Salary and sub-treasury\n\nThe Polkadot EVM Collective has its own salary system and sub-treasury system for future\nuse. Their values, right now, is always 0. Any increase or funding is only done through\nPolkadot referendums.\n\n## Seeding\n\nAll seeding members are subject to a final vote of a root referendum.\n\nSee the [repository](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/seeding) for the\nupdated seeding list.\n\n## Discussions\n\n### A big collective or several small collectives\n\nWhile designing the collective, the first question we faced is whether we should have\none single big collective -- one that covers all Polkadot ecocsystem (\"The Polkadot\nEcosystem Collective\") -- or several small collectives, each focusing on a concrete and\nspecific field in Polkadot.\n\nWe believe that small collectives are much more effective in carrying out its tasks:\n\n* Being **concrete and specific** ensures that all members of the collective always know\n  the mission of the collective. What belongs, and not belongs a collective is always\n  extremely clear.\n* Small collectives are **composible**. It's possible to compose small collectives into\n  a big collective, should the need raises. Members of the big collective are instances of\n  small collectives, instead of people. On the other hand, it's difficult to divide a big\n  collective into smaller collectives, if we realize that the former is not functioning\n  well.\n* Small collectives can **move faster and get more things done** because everyone is working\n  in roughly the same field. Misunderstandings are less likely. The objectives are more\n  clear. Participations are better encouraged because all motions / RFCs matters to\n  nearly everyone.\n\nThe only real drawback we know so far about small collectives is the **maintenance burden**. At\nthis moment, all collectives require separate runtime pallets and also requiring runtime upgrade.\nAs we expect at least a dozen new collectives in the near future, this is not scalable. We plan\nto address this by helping the Fellowship to develop a separate set of pallets that can host\nmultiple collectives, with sub-treasury and salary features. Proposing a new collective becomes\na runtime config change, instead of a runtime upgrade.\n\n### A flat or a deep ranking system\n\nReaders may notice that in Polkadot EVM Collective's membership design, we only have two ranks,\njunior members (with vote power correspond to rank I), and senior members (with vote power correspond\nto rank III). We designed this to be a **flat ranking system**. This is in contrast to the\nPolkadot Fellowship Collective where we have a **deep ranking system**, with 7-9 ranks.\n\nWe use a flat ranking system due to the practicality of the Polkadot EVM Collective, that we\nwant to ensure that majority of members are actually on-board with a certain motion. The EVM collective\ndeals less with visionary changes, but more with the practical reality of making EVM work well on\nPolkadot. We want to ensure that, for example, EVM metering changes done specifically for Polkadot\nare properly reviewed, that precompiles can work with each other, and that EVM contracts across\ndifferent parachains can interop. It is therefore really important to ensure that members are\nactually on-board, without the risk if a really senior member disagrees with everyone else.\n\nRank only defines a member's voting power. We introduced a separate concept, called **roles**, to\ndefine a member's responsibilities within the collective. Any financial incentives or benefits of\na member is associated with a role, but not a rank. A role can be a project maintainer, an RFC editor,\na community spokesperson, or a special task-force. Compared with the design of the Fellowship collective,\nwhich relies on a linear scale of ranks, the separate concept of roles makes it significantly easier\nto assess a member, and determine whether she or he is sufficiently carrying out the duty.\n",

It is first and foremost a\nstandardization body that will be in charge of its own RFC process. It wants to\nprovide transparency over the development and maintenance of various tools that\nthe ecosystem uses. It also tries to create an inclusive roadmap with the aim\nof reconcile different needs. And finally, it provides expert opinions to those\nwho need them. We'll discuss the four goals in more details in the following\nsections.\n\nThe discussion of an on-chain Polkadot EVM collective has been under way during\nthe early days of Frontier development. During the last few months, especially\nduring Parity's \"decentralization\", we increasingly see the need of an on-chain\ncollective as the Frontier project moves independent. The recent \"OpenEVM\"\nmovement (credit to *Giotto*) heavily accelerated the process.\n\n## Goals\n\n### Standardization\n\nIn the context of Polkadot EVM, there are a number of Polkadot-specific\nmodifications we need to do. Polkadot EVM has custom precompiles as well as\ncustom gas metering logic. In the past, we have also seen some specific use\ncases that require custom transaction format or new opcodes. The Polkadot EVM\ncollective aims to create an RFC process to document them.\n\nA standardization process is important in certain modifications. The collective\nitself acts as a review and audit body to help discover various security issues\nin the specifications. It also helps to improve interoperability across\nparachains, as eventually we want to have contracts on different parachains\ntalking with each other freely.\n\n### Development and maintenance\n\nThe collective aims to bring more transparency over the development and\nmaintenance of various tools that the ecosystem uses. We aim to link the\nmembership of the EVM collective with the membership and merge rights in the\n[polkadot-evm](https://github.com/polkadot-evm) Github organization. It\ntherefore becomes clear who is responsible for the maintenance and who can merge\nPRs. It avoids single-point-of-failure if one person is temporarily not available.\nIt also helps in the situation that some technical differences between different\nmembers are non-conciliable (but hopefully we never come to that point).\n\n### Roadmap\n\nDuring the past few years when working on the Frontier project, I've seen, at\nfirst hand, the vast different opinions on how the Polkadot community should\nwork with EVM development. And I'm afraid to say, that it is still the case at\nthis moment, that there's a big disconnect between the core development team,\nand the parachain ecosystem. While those are purely different technical views,\nthey have vast influence on how subsequently the ecosystem develops tools and\nuse contracts.\n\nShould the EVM interpreter be on-chain or should EVM contracts be off-chain\ncompiled first? How strict should we treat EVM compatibility? What is the\ntimeline of EVM? Should we support EVM indefinitely, or is it purely there to\nprovide a migration path to WASM/RISC-V?\n\nSuch issues have big impact over dapp developers. If they develop on Polkadot,\nwe want to make sure they have certainty over what they may have and not have in\nthe near future, so that they know that whatever tools they developed wouldn't\nbe made obsolete by the core dev team. The Polkadot EVM collective aims to\nprovide a discussion platform that can provide some certainty.\n\nWe also deal with bigger issue in the roadmap, such as the migration of a\ncomplete Ethereum blockchain over to Polkadot. (Yes, this is possible and\ntechnically a planned feature in Frontier.)\n\n### Expert opinions\n\nThe Polkadot EVM collective also aims to provide expert opinions and help in\nreview, audit, and coordinate certain ecosystem initiatives. For example, the\ncollective may be in charge to draft the detailed technical requirements for the\nnew \"OpenEVM\" parachain and supervise its implementation. For this, we currently\ndon't expect the collective to handle anything related to code implementation.\nIt will likely be decided through a tendering process via a treasury referendum,\nand developed by an external team who wins the bid.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe scope of the collective is intentionally set to be specific and concrete in\norder to ensure a functional collaberation. One is eligible as a member of the\nPolkadot EVM collective if one is involved in the development of a tool or a\nparachain/solochain that has EVM feature. This currently includes:\n\n* [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier)\n* [Rust-EVM](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm)\n* [Moonbeam](https://github.com/moonbeam-foundation/moonbeam)\n* [Astar](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar)\n* [Tangle](https://github.com/webb-tools/tangle)\n* [Edgeware (EdgeEVM)](https://github.com/edgeware-network/edgeware-node)\n* [Polkadot EVM substrate-etl/Dune integration (Colorful Notion)](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/366)\n* [Acala](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala)\n* [Darwinia](https://github.com/darwinia-network/darwinia)\n* [Hyperledger Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger/solang)\n* [Magnet](https://github.com/Magport/Magnet)\n* [NeuroWeb](https://github.com/OriginTrail/neuroweb)\n* Please submit PRs to add another tool to this list.\n\n## Membership\n\nThere are two aspects of the membership -- ranks and roles. Rank defines a member's\nvoting power within the collective. Role gives out ecosystem-specific permissions\nand responsibilities.\n\n### Rank\n\nThe EVM Collective uses a flat ranking system. We have two ranks.\n\n* **Junior members**. This corresponds to rank I. This is a member that is at least\n  somewhat involved in Polkadot EVM development.\n* **Senior members**. This corresponds to rank III. This is a member that is deeply\n  involved in Polkadot EVM development.\n\nThe ranks of a member define the member's voting power. Unlike the Fellowship\ncollective, rank does not determine a member's other privileges, such as any financial\nincentives. They are instead defined by \"roles\", which we explain in more\ndetails below.\n\n### Role\n\nRole defines a member's responsibilities within the collective. The collective is run\nunder the assumption that a member's contribution is correlated with the member's\ndevotion, not seniority. As a result, financial incentives (if any) is associated with\na role, but not with ranks. There are also no limitations on lower ranks with \"higher\"\nroles. A junior member might well have more financial incentives or other benefits,\nthan a senior member, if she or he contributes more.\n\nThe list of roles are dynamic. On-chain, the definition of a role contains only two\ninformation -- its index, and a shortname. Roles can be added or removed by changing\nthe runtime config, without runtime upgrades. The addition and removal of roles,\nand the granting and dismissing of roles of a member, is done by a majority vote of\nthe collective (respective to the member's voting power), or a referendum in OpenGov.\n\nThe initial list of roles will only be defined once the collective becomes active\non-chain, subject to all members' approvals. Below are examples of possible roles:\n\n* **RFC editor**: grants merge rights to the EVM RFC repository, responsible for\n  maintaining the RFC process.\n* **Frontier maintainer**: grants merge rights to the Frontier repository, responsible\n  for maintaining the Frontier project and making new releases.\n* **Other project maintainer roles**.\n* **Speaker of the collective**: responsible for publishing the collective's annual report\n  to the community and handle certain communications.\n* **Special task force roles**. For example, launching a community-driven EVM parachain.\n\n### Inactivity\n\nTo ensure that the collective is able to move forward and is not bloated with members of\ninactions, an inactivity check is utilized. We define the exact algorithm below. The gist of\nthe algorithm is that we require each member to rate whether they think that each other member\nis active. A member must receive at least 1/3 of the votes to continue to be considered active.\n\nThe checking period is every 24 weeks (roughly 6 months). During each period, a member is\nrequired to submit an on-chain extrinsic for inactivity check. The content of the extrinsic\nis a bitmap of all other members, where `1` represents that the member believes that the\nother member is active, and `0` otherwise. Repeated extrinsic submissions will override past\nones.\n\nAt the end of each checking period, the following is applied:\n\n* Set `N0` to be the total number of active members in the last checking period.\n* If a member did not submit any on-chain extrinsic, it is marked inactive.\n* All new inactive members are filtered out. Set `N1` to be the total number of new\n  (pending) active members.\n* Collect the bitmap of all submitted on-chain extrinsics. If the count of `1`s for a member\n  is greater than or equal to `N1 / 3` rounded down to the nearest integer, then it is set\n  as active. Otherwise, it is set as inactive.\n\nAn inactive member keeps its rank, but will not be able to vote and will not count towards\nthe required quorum. An inactive member will also have all of its roles set to inactive.\n\nThe meaning of each inactive role is defined by each role. Usually, this means that the member\nwill not have the privileges and responsibilities associated with the role.\n\nAn inactive member is moved back to the active list by either a majority vote of the collective,\nor by a Polkadot referendum.\n\n## Salary and sub-treasury\n\nThe Polkadot EVM Collective has its own salary system and sub-treasury system for future\nuse. Their values, right now, is always 0. Any increase or funding is only done through\nPolkadot referendums.\n\n## Seeding\n\nAll seeding members are subject to a final vote of a root referendum. Please submit PRs\nto add your name to the seeding list.\n\n| Github username | Polkadot Account | Rank |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n\n## Discussions\n\n### A big collective or several small collectives\n\nWhile designing the collective, the first question we faced is whether we should have\none single big collective -- one that covers all Polkadot ecocsystem (\"The Polkadot\nEcosystem Collective\") -- or several small collectives, each focusing on a concrete and\nspecific field in Polkadot.\n\nWe believe that small collectives are much more effective in carrying out its tasks:\n\n* Being **concrete and specific** ensures that all members of the collective always know\n  the mission of the collective. What belongs, and not belongs a collective is always\n  extremely clear.\n* Small collectives are **composible**. It's possible to compose small collectives into\n  a big collective, should the need raises. Members of the big collective are instances of\n  small collectives, instead of people. On the other hand, it's difficult to divide a big\n  collective into smaller collectives, if we realize that the former is not functioning\n  well.\n* Small collectives can **move faster and get more things done** because everyone is working\n  in roughly the same field. Misunderstandings are less likely. The objectives are more\n  clear. Participations are better encouraged because all motions / RFCs matters to\n  nearly everyone.\n\nThe only real drawback we know so far about small collectives is the **maintenance burden**. At\nthis moment, all collectives require separate runtime pallets and also requiring runtime upgrade.\nAs we expect at least a dozen new collectives in the near future, this is not scalable. We plan\nto address this by helping the Fellowship to develop a separate set of pallets that can host\nmultiple collectives, with sub-treasury and salary features. Proposing a new collective becomes\na runtime config change, instead of a runtime upgrade.\n\n### A flat or a deep ranking system\n\nReaders may notice that in Polkadot EVM Collective's membership design, we only have two ranks,\njunior members (with vote power correspond to rank I), and senior members (with vote power correspond\nto rank III). We designed this to be a **flat ranking system**. This is in contrast to the\nPolkadot Fellowship Collective where we have a **deep ranking system**, with 7-9 ranks.\n\nWe use a flat ranking system due to the practicality of the Polkadot EVM Collective, that we\nwant to ensure that majority of members are actually on-board with a certain motion. The EVM collective\ndeals less with visionary changes, but more with the practical reality of making EVM work well on\nPolkadot. We want to ensure that, for example, EVM metering changes done specifically for Polkadot\nare properly reviewed, that precompiles can work with each other, and that EVM contracts across\ndifferent parachains can interop. It is therefore really important to ensure that members are\nactually on-board, without the risk if a really senior member disagrees with everyone else.\n\nRank only defines a member's voting power. We introduced a separate concept, called **roles**, to\ndefine a member's responsibilities within the collective. Any financial incentives or benefits of\na member is associated with a role, but not a rank. A role can be a project maintainer, an RFC editor,\na community spokesperson, or a special task-force. Compared with the design of the Fellowship collective,\nwhich relies on a linear scale of ranks, the separate concept of roles makes it significantly easier\nto assess a member, and determine whether she or he is sufficiently carrying out the duty.\n",

However for things of extreme importance it is risky to trust a third party because of the well-known agent problem Just like in your daily life you can issue a POA for a commercial contract but not for extremely important events like for example marriage / divorce / etc Certain events are so critical that it is important to know that there is no risk that the agent might have a different opinion than the owner This is not specifically targeted at DV (even if of course their role has to be considered) but it's more about the idea that for certain tracks it is perfectly reasonable to do delegations and for others it's not in order to protect the integrity of the system",
