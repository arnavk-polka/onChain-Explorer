      "title": "Increasing the Validator minimum commission from 10% to 15%",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nThis proposal seeks to increase the validator minimum commission from 10% to 15% with the goal of improving the sustainable operations of validator nodes.  It is believed that in doing so we are improving the security of the network by properly incentivizing validators.\n\nPresent revenue:\n\nAt present validators share a reward of ~800 KSM per 6 hour era, at 10% commission and a KSM rate of $16.50/KSM a validator is expected to earn -> (800 KSM / 1000 validators) * 10% * 4 eras * 30 days * $16.50 = $158.40 / mth.  \n\nProposed revenue:\n\nApplying the same calculation as above but replacing commission at 15%:\n (800 KSM / 1000 validators) * 15% * 4 eras * 30 days * $16.50 = $237.60 / mth.  \n\nI remain confident with research done in previous proposals that an ideal revenue for a Kusama Validator lies between $300 - $500 / mth, this affords enough revenue to cover expenses for a server, tooling, compensation for time invested and to afford the validator some profit (after tax).\n\nAt present rates, it is difficult for a validator to justify the need to operate a validator as revenue barely meets the cost of a to-spec server.   It is also difficult for individual validators to justify the desire to spend time and effort to gain nominations to become \"independent\", this activity takes several months and in my own experience years. \n\nThe proposal of 15% takes a conservative position which matches the maximum commission set by the Decentralized Nodes (DN) programme.  It gives existing validators an opportunity to reduce their exposure and some incentive for DN validators to gain some more revenue while also being competitive. I hope to complement this proposal with another (more drastic) proposal to increase inflation while locking some of the additional rewards.\n\nPrevious proposals:\n- The first successful proposal to [increase the minimum commission](https://kusama.subsquare.io/democracy/referenda/176) to 3%\n- The second successful proposal to [increase the minimum commission](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/79) from 3% to 10%\n\nRegards,\nWill | Paradox | ParaNodes.io",

Therefore, it was decided to reassign the invulnerable slots of Kusama People to other community collators, while leaving the list of invulnerable collators on Kusama Coretime unchanged. It is important to emphasize that there was NO negligence or misconduct on the part of the collators being removed; the same list was simply erroneously used for the two chain-spec files when the system chains was launched, so only for this reason, we are reassigning the slots now):\n   - LuckyFriday `HPUEzi4v3YJmhBfSbcGEFFiNKPAGVnGkfDiUzBNTR7j1CxT`\n   - Mile `HmatizNhXrZtXwQK2LfntvjCy3x1EuKs1WnRQ6CP3KkNfmA`\n   - Paranodes `J11Rp4mjz3vRb2DL51HqRGRjhuEQRyXgtuFskebXb8zMZ9s`\n   - TurboFlakes `H1tAQMm3eizGcmpAhL9aA9gR844kZpQfkU7pkmMiLx9jSzE`\n   - YellowFinTuna `DtuntvQBh9vajFTnd42aTTCiuCyY3ep6EVwhhPji2ejyyhW`\n   - bLd `CbLd7BdUr8DqD4TciR1kH6w12bbHBCW9n2MHGCtbxq4U5ty`\n2) <ins>Adding the following invulnerable collators</ins>:\n   - BestValidator `GHW6TB6awErp2VaySKN6dLdjmzKET1LzCKMMTYMnGMUXs7n`\n   - OpenBitlab `E8X4LxU9zEiNVAyM95ERDeomMmwwqn7RBCuRMEZCfgFm3J1`\n   - StakerSpace `DGHxPHM19z1C6tvRhf1tBARB38uV8tudHQsSm2a3bonuSU4`\n   - StakeWorld `Et9M3rrA7H2kHQEGRXHxufcp9HTEmFirMWtKHvjoJ85r1C9`\n   - MathCrypto `F7TKjT2EBVqfquyN5G4s4FLSxHM7nR3WbdRAgxQLeJYVG53`\n   - STKD `HWBh4YQ69iopm9G8x938dEivMENXeHaHZraannpg4U4aib2`\n3) <ins>Set Candidacy Bond to 50 KSM</ins> (aligning it with other Kusama System Parachains)\n4) <ins>Set Desired Candidates to 6</ins> (opening of 6 permissionless slots)\n\n\n**Kusama Coretime**\n\n1) <ins>Set Candidacy Bond to 50 KSM</ins> (aligning it with other Kusama System Parachains)\n2) <ins>Set Desired Candidates to 6</ins> (opening of 6 permissionless slots)\n\n\nThe new permissionless slots will be opened to any new collator by placing a minimum bond of 50 KSM once this referendum is enacted.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nLuca from 🧊 Iceberg Nodes 🧊, on behalf of System Parachains Collators",

The issue on the [original call](https://kusama.subscan.io/referenda_v2/308) falls on two of the six collators being duplicated and two others missing.\n\nAfter discussing the issue with my peers, I would like to present this referenda to the community today. It intends to fix the previous issue and promote LuckyFriday and ParaNodes to invulnerables on Asset-Hub Kusama as per the intention of the previous referendum.\n\nOnce again, apologies to LuckyFriday and ParaNodes for wrongly being missed on the previous call.\n\nAnd thank you all for your time and vote,\nPaulo\n",

The reason for the failed instruction was due to the fact of missing onchain session keys from one of the collators by the time the referenda moved into the execution phase.\n\nAt the time, knowing that the runtime v1000000 would bring new extrinsics to better handle such cases and also facilitate add/remove invulnerables, was than discussed by all parties involved that would make sense to wait until the current runtime was active on chain to propose a new referenda that would fix the previous XCM instruction, and such referenda could also be used as an opportunity to try out the new extrinsic – collatorSelection.addInvulnerable. \n\nAs a result I’m proposing this referendum asking the community to vote on it.\n\n**What to expect from this referendum**\nWith the successful outcome we could expect the following:\n\n- 6 new invulnerables, changing the total number from 2 to 8 (Note: the following list of collators were the ones already previously selected on referenda 224)\nTurboFlakes: `H1tAQMm3eizGcmpAhL9aA9gR844kZpQfkU7pkmMiLx9jSzE`\nLuckyFriday: `HPUEzi4v3YJmhBfSbcGEFFiNKPAGVnGkfDiUzBNTR7j1CxT`\nParaNodes: `J11Rp4mjz3vRb2DL51HqRGRjhuEQRyXgtuFskebXb8zMZ9s`\nPolkadotters: `EPGHRDFaBbQz4uF8DgnuScxYp4rvvtpL5MTed7VvGprNQmm`\nStake.Plus: `E5G5qLNBF7nwhemokqNrNwUCQ7oHrLsBVjSc7XhTdRq8672`\nIcebergNodes: `Eicei1RVHvqHBPJAY2fZpLy2KtCMjY7Kwjo3svjmGLH7FmT`\n\n- 3 out of the 9 active permissionless collators will automatically switch to invulnerables with the remaining 6 keeping their active slot.\n\nThanks for your vote and time\npaulo // apps.turboflakes.io\n",

The new minimum untrusted score was calculated by averaging the last 30 election scores and halving them (starting from election at block [#17416892](https://kusama.subscan.io/block/17416892)).\n\nWhen enacted, this proposal will change the current untrusted minimum score in Kusama from\n\n```\n{\n  minimalStake: '1,722,238,583,242,009',\n  sumStake: '2,171,296,385,410,646,127',\n  sumStakeSquared: '62,184,223,048,402,160,114,561,549,513,680,866'\n}\n```\n\nto\n```\n{\n  minimalStake: '2,957,640,724,907,066',\n  sumStake: '3,471,819,933,857,856,584',\n  sumStakeSquared: '78,133,097,080,615,021,100,202,963,085,417,458'\n}\n```\n\n--- \n\n## Why is this change important?\n\nThe [`MinimumUntrustedScore`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/election-provider-multi-phase/src/lib.rs#L1326) configuration defines the minimum election score that will be accepted by the elections pallet from off-chain staking miners. Increasing the minimum untrusted score ensures that weak election solutions will not be accepted. The proposed election score is more sensible and secure given the current state of the network. \n",

      "title": "Kusama Validator minimum commission rate",
      "content": "\n**Short description:** This proposal seeks to adjust validator minimum commission rate from 3% to 10%\n\n**Project Category / Type:** Infrastructure\n\n**Discussion date:** 23.11.2022.  [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1993](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1993)\n\n**Onchain publish date:** 26.01.2023.\n\n**Governance referenda origin call:** staking_admin\n\n**Context**\n\nThis proposal seeks to adjust the validator minimum commission rate and keeps all other staking configurations unchanged. In the current market (last several months) validator income from the minimum commission can cover less than 50% of the server rent costs. In order to maintain a sustainable environment and prevent the network degradation I am passing this proposal to onchain voting.\n\n**Problem**\n\nThere were several topics regarding to the validator infrastructure expenses and operational costs that can be found here:\n\n[https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1980](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1980)\n\n[https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1306](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1306)\n\nA fully active validator operating at 3% commission can stand to earn:\n\n(800/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.03 = 2.88 KSM/month. \nWith KSM priced at 34$ this equates to ~97.92 USD/month. \n\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe proposed increase of minimum commission to 10% is trying to create a better and more sustainable network environment. With the numbers given above it is clear this is a small step towards this goal. Beside the commission, we would need KSM price to double and reach 50$ in order to earn ~480 USD/month which is still within the boundaries of operational costs.\n\nWith this proposal we are not influencing KSM inflation rate. We are asking the nominators to steer 1.36% of their staking APY towards the network, current returns are 18.88% and we anticipate it to be 17.52% all other factors being equal. We need to have a strong, reliable, secure and redundant blockchain network in order to process and secure multi million $ assets on it.\n\n\n**Objectives**\n\nValidator earnings and effects on staking rewards\n\nA fully active validator operating at 3% commission can stand to earn \n(800/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.03 = 2.88 KSM/month. : \n\n- with KSM priced at 25$ this equates to ~ 72.00 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 34$ this equates to ~ 97.92 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 50$ this equates to ~ 144.00 USD/month.\n\nA fully active validator operating at 10% commission can stand to earn \n(800/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.1 = 9.60 KSM/ month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 25$ this equates to ~ 240.00 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 34$ this equates to ~ 326.40 USD/month.\n\n- with KSM priced at 50$ this equates to ~ 480.00 USD/month.\n\n\n**Known constraints**\n\nA significant change of KSM price can have a positive or a negative impact to the changes proposed. This proposal is not trying to set permanent staking parameters i.e.  In a scenario where KSM hits $100 anyone can start a new proposal to decrease the commission rate.\n\n\n\n**[Full Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sHrRM7wPv390GfhdPJeUKtfKD81X5ME5OIGrlDXqOXI/edit?usp=sharing)**",
