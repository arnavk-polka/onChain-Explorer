      "title": "WFC - KIRA (Kusama Inflation Reduction Act)",
      "content": "\n**KIRA (Kusama Inflation Reduction Act)**\n\nThis KIRA WFC proposal aims to make Kusama more attractive and to promote its adaptation. Not only for new users, but also for all existing users. To achieve this, the following is proposed and put to the vote:\n\n**1) Reintroduction of treasury burning**\n\nKusama has spending periods. It is proposed that the treasury burns 0.5% of its unspent amount of KSM per spending period, thereby reducing the amount in circulation. The treasury burns at Polkadot should serve as a model. [Paragraph has been edited]\n\n**2) Introduction of a general voting fee**\n\nOpenGov allows anyone with KSM to vote. It is proposed that a modest voting fee of one per mille, i.e. 0.001, is due for each KSM used, which is burned (not locked) in the process and thus removed from circulation forever. KSM that are used with conviction are taxed according to that (1x conviction = 1 KSM, 2x conviction = 2 KSM, etc.).\n\nIn the case of delegated votes, the original wallets are taxed. The person who receives delegated votes only pays fees on their own KSMs, but not on those that have been delegated to them for voting.\n\nExample: _Person A votes for a proposal and commits 100 KSM with a conviction of 3x. 100 KSM x 3 = 300 KSM. 300 KSM x 0.001 = 0.3 KSM fee._\n\nThis mechanism ensures that the demand for KSM is slowly but surely increasing. Due to its low level, it does not prevent anyone from voting, but ensures that those who wield political and economic power make a contribution to the community as a whole. [Paragraph has been edited]\n\n**3) Introduction of a general treasury tax for outflows**\n\nIn the case of treasury proposals, it is usual for the KSM or stable coins paid out to be sold. To counteract this selling pressure, it is proposed that the treasury automatically burns (not locks) 10% of the amount paid out from its own holdings in addition to the payout, which in turn reduces the amount in circulation.\n\nExample: _Group A requests 100 KSM from the treasury. The proposal is accepted. The treasury transfers 100 KSM to group A. The treasury burns 10 KSM from the remaining assets._\n\n**4) Reduction of the maximum inflation rate**\n\nKusama's main problem is its current maximum inflation rate, which leads to a long-term supply surplus, which in turn leads to a price reduction according to the laws of supply and demand.\n\nAs this model has demonstrably not led to more adaptation and thus jeopardizes the long-term financing of the project, also with regard to investor protection, it is proposed that the maximum inflation rate be set at 5% per year.\n\nTwo points should be mentioned in this context:\n\nA few weeks ago, the minimum commission rate for validators was increased from 10% to 15%, giving validators 50% more income than before. A reduction in the maximum inflation rate therefore does not harm them in any way, as this percentage amount is not affected. On the contrary, they will also benefit from a reduction in the maximum inflation rate.\n\nSecondly, and for all those who are worried about their staking rewards, rest assured that with the current inflationary strategy and the consequent fall in prices, these are not worthwhile on balance anyway. For precisely this reason, a reduction in the maximum inflation rate is needed, which incidentally has also been implemented at Polkadot.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWith these changes and future adjustments to the Coretime pricing model, Kusama would become considerably more attractive again. Why exactly?\n\na) The amount of newly created KSM is significantly reduced, which increases the supply much less quickly. KSM therefore becomes more valuable because it is scarcer.\n\nb) The amount of KSM in circulation is slowly but steadily reduced by the newly introduced fees, which also lowers real inflation. KSM therefore becomes even more valuable as it is scarcer.\n\nc) Although the percentage of staking rewards will decrease due to the reduction in the maximum inflation rate, the value of staking rewards will increase as the reduction on the supply side leads to a price increase (supply shock).\n\nd) Due to the voting fee, it will slowly but steadily become necessary to buy more (new) KSMs in order to maintain the previous voting strength, which will increase the buying pressure.\n\nThank you very much for supporting this proposal and have a wonderful day!\n\n_PS: If you would like this proposal to be put to a vote, please consider paying the decision deposit, as it is unfortunately impossible for me to do so. :'(_",

      "title": "WFC:🪶 Feather Protocol: A Collective Intelligence Layer for the Kusama Network and Beyond",
      "content": "[Github](https://github.com/Decent-Partners/Feather-Protocol/blob/main/README.md)\n\n> *\"I wonder where all these feathers came from. The clouds, do you think?\"* — Winnie the Pooh\n\n---\n\n## ✨ TL;DR\n\nFeather Protocol is a decentralised, experimental intelligence layer on Kusama, allowing anyone to publish diverse content via `system.remarkWithEvent`.\n\nIt aggregates this into generative zines that evolve into [Kreivo-based DAOs on Asset Hub](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/5380), scalable by emergent teams. \n\nUsing [Noir zero-knowledge proofs](https://noir-lang.org/) (ZKPs), Feather ensures privacy and scalability, burns KSM via the incoming [Dark Hole pallet](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/539), and mitigates spam and offensive content risks through economic and cultural incentives.\n\nValidators gain new economic roles as [Akash-style contributors](https://akash.network), supporting zine production, storage, and [Livepeer](https://livepeer.org)-inspired real-time AI transcoding.\n\n> No gatekeepers. No permission needed.\n  \n> ~~Expect~~ Create ChaOS.\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Why Feather?\n\nKusama’s experimental spirit lacks a platform to amplify its community’s ideas and art. Feather addresses this by:\n\n- Building an open publication layer for Kusama.\n- Indexing diverse genres with Noir ZKPs for authenticity.\n- Enabling organic meaning-making.\n- Transforming zines into cultural artefacts, enhanced by validator-driven media production and Kreivo DAOs.\n\nInspired by RMRK’s remark-based NFTs, Feather overcomes scalability issues with Noir and IPFS, harnessing Kusama’s collective creativity.\n\n---\n\n## 🤔 Why Is This Good for Kusama?\n\nFeather enriches Kusama’s ecosystem by:\n\n- Fostering a diverse, unified collective through varied contributions.\n- Unlocking emergent insights from unfiltered input.\n- Reinforcing decentralisation with permissionless `system.remarkWithEvent` composability.\n- Driving KSM deflation by burning fees in the Dark Hole pallet.\n- Preserving cultural memory via evolving DAO-managed zines.\n- Strengthening community identity with validator-supported media.\n- Pioneering on-chain cognition through DAO governance.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 How It Works\n\n### 🐤 Publishing\n\nUsers submit content using:\n\n```plaintext\nFEATHER::<genre>::<optional title>::<content>\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nFEATHER::theory::Onchain Telepathy::All governance is performance art...\nFEATHER::dream::Midnight Validator::I dreamt I minted the wind.\nFEATHER::log::Parachain Sync Lag::Node fell 300 blocks behind at 3:14AM UTC.\nFEATHER::image::Wormhole Diagram::QmX9abc123...\n```\n\nGenres include: `theory`, `rant`, `poem`, `image`, `log`, `dream`, `scene`, `fiction`, `alert`.\n\nOptimisations:\n\n- IPFS storage for large content, linked by hashes.\n- Noir ZK verification with compact on-chain proofs.\n- Batching via indexers to reduce fees, with burns via the Dark Hole pallet.\n- Rate limits and dynamic fees to deter spam.\n\n---\n\n### 📖 Reading\n\nA frontend generates zines from indexed entries:\n\n- Spanning time or block ranges.\n- Adapting layouts to content type, frequency, and tags.\n- Tracking contributions via wallets, pseudonyms, or ZK proof of personhood.\n- Evolving art/styling via validator compute.\n- Transforming each zine into a Kreivo DAO/media brand, scalable by emergent teams and validators.\n- Offering feeds, threads, timelines, or topical debates.\n\n---\n\n## 🌈 The Vision\n\nFeather evolves into:\n\n- 🪞 A governance sentiment tool (Kreivo DAOs)\n- 🧵 An ecosystem news system scaled by validator teams\n- 🖼️ A collective mindmap, professionally rendered\n- 🧪 A human-machine thought lab\n- 🧬 A scene-based identity framework\n- 🪙 A reward system for insights\n- 🪙 A provenance and licensing system for novel on-chain IP\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Technical Overview\n\n- Publishing: `system.remarkWithEvent` for event-driven posts.\n- Scalability: Noir ZKPs, IPFS, batching, and DAO integration.\n- Indexing: Detects `FEATHER::` events, verifies proofs, retrieves content.\n- Frontend: Built with SvelteKit or Next.js.\n- Media: Validators provide Akash-style compute/storage via Kreivo DAOs.\n\n---\n\n## 📢 Why `system.remarkWithEvent`?\n\n- Emits events for efficient indexing.\n- Reduces overhead vs full-chain scans.\n- Enables private, spam-resistant, and scalable publishing when combined with Noir.\n\n**Consideration**: The system remark method requires a dedicated intermediary to index remarks for data construction. A pallet with extrinsics could simplify fetching entries via regular RPCs and light clients, potentially enhancing accessibility for users relying on lightweight nodes.\n\n---\n\n## 🔐 Scalability with Noir\n\nNoir (Aztec's ZKP language) solves RMRK’s scaling issues by:\n\n- Verifying remarks off-chain with compact zk-SNARKs.\n- Aggregating data for lower costs.\n- Enabling pseudonymous posts.\n- Securing DAO/validator contributions.\n- Supporting IPFS off-chain content.\n\n---\n\n## 🧪 Practical Implementation\n\n- Remark Verification: Noir circuit checks format and IPFS hash.\n- Rate Limiting: Enforced via private ZK logic (e.g., 10/1000 blocks).\n- DAO Verification: Proves contributor eligibility for governance.\n- Validator Contribution: Verifies compute/storage contributions.\n- On-Chain: `pallet-noir-verifier` checks proofs, stores minimal data.\n- Indexing: Community-run batch processors.\n- Privacy: Proves validity without revealing identity.\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Path to Implementation\n\n- Phase 1: Prototype – Noir circuits, frontend, IPFS integration.\n- Phase 2: On-Chain – Pallets, Kreivo integration, validator enablement.\n- Phase 3: Scale – Optimise for high volume and professional teams.\n\nTools: Noir CLI, Barretenberg, Substrate.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Media and Economic Opportunities\n\nValidators become Akash-style contributors:\n\n- Zine Production: GPU-rendered layouts/AI designs.\n- Storage: Scalable, DAO-funded commercial hosting.\n- Streaming: Live events with validator-transcoded video (Livepeer-style).\n- Economics: Paid in KSM/stablecoin, with fee burns.\n- Scalability: Validator teams service global zine projects.\n- Security: Economic viability reinforces validator participation.\n\n---\n\n## 🔥 Driving KSM Burning with the Dark Hole Pallet\n\nFeather fuels deflation through:\n\n- Usage fees (0.01–0.1 KSM per remark) burned.\n- Batching (e.g., 1 KSM burn per 1,000 remarks).\n- Spam deterrents \n- DAO and validator fees add to burns.\n\n---\n\n## ⚠️ Risks and Mitigations\n\n- Noir Rate Limiting: ZK-enforced private limits.\n- DAO Self-Regulation: Anonymous ZK flagging, not removal.\n- IPFS Offloading: Avoids chain bloat.\n- Batching/Monitoring: Reduces load, flags abuse without censorship.\n\n---\n\n## 🔮 Call to the Community\n\nWe’re looking for:\n\n- 🧠 Concept contributors\n- ✍️ On-chain authors: poets, builders, memers\n- 👩‍💻 Developers: Noir, UI, pallets, streaming, generative AI\n- 🎨 Designers: visual identity etc.\n- 🐦 Boundary-pushers on Kusama\n\n---\n\n## 🌐 Get Involved\n\n- Submit a `FEATHER::` remark via `system.remarkWithEvent` and dogfood the creation of Feather.\n- Index submitted Feathers in this trial phase and help bring the flock together.\n- Critique the concept, improve things, quit moaning etc. \n\n---\n\n## 🪪 Licence\n\nMIT © Birdbrain\n```\n\n",

Longer term, improvements to the market in terms of price discovery (RFC-17) should be considered, **especially once demand grows**. \n\n#  An unsustainable economy \n\nWe posit that the coretime experiment should be seen as a useful resource, but deprioritised as a near or even medium term strategy for sustaining the current Kusama economy.\n\n#  Time for alternatives\n\nin addition to accepting the limitations of coretime, this WFC aims to also encourage alternative and perhaps more radical proposals for burning KSM and building a diversified and productive treasury reserve. \n",

      "title": "WFC: From 1000 to 500 Validators: Higher Rewards, Lower Inflation, Stronger Network",
      "content": "## Executive Summary\n\nWe propose optimizing Kusama's validator set from 1,000 to 500 validators while reducing total rewards by 25%. This strategic adjustment will **increase individual validator compensation by 50%**, attract higher-quality infrastructure providers, and **reduce KSM inflation by 25%** - creating a more sustainable and robust network for all stakeholders.\n\n## The Vision: A Stronger, More Sustainable Kusama\n\nKusama has always been about bold experimentation and pioneering change. Today, we have an opportunity to strengthen our network's foundation while addressing two critical challenges: **validator sustainability** and **token economics**.\n\n## Current Challenges → Our Solutions\n\n📊 **Calculation Basis (as of June 24th, 2025)**\n\n- KSM price: ~$14 USD\n- Reward per era: ~813 KSM\n- These values are used for illustration. The percentage improvements (50% increase in validator rewards, 25% reduction in inflation) remain constant regardless of token price.\n\n### 🔴 Challenge 1: Unsustainable Validator Economics\nCurrently, validators earning minimum commission receive only **$205/month** - barely covering costs in EU/USA and completely inadequate for quality infrastructure in Asia, Africa, or South America.\n\n**→ Solution**: Our proposal increases validator rewards to **$307.50/month** - a 50% increase that makes running quality infrastructure profitable worldwide.\n\n### 🔴 Challenge 2: Sell Pressure from Inflation\nContinuous token emissions create downward price pressure, affecting all KSM holders.\n\n**→ Solution**: Reducing total rewards by 25% directly cuts inflation, benefiting long-term holders while still improving validator economics.\n\n## The Mathematics of Success\n\n**Current State:**\n\n- Total inflation funds both validator rewards AND treasury\n- 813 KSM per era × 4 eras/day × 30 days = 97,560 KSM/month validator rewards\n- Divided by 1,000 validators = 97.56 KSM per validator\n- At 15% commission: **14.63 KSM** (~$205) per validator\n\n**Proposed State:**\n\n- **Total inflation reduced by 25%** (affecting both rewards and treasury proportionally)\n- 75% of current rewards = 73,170 KSM/month validator rewards\n- Divided by 500 validators = 146.34 KSM per validator\n- At 15% commission: **21.95 KSM** (~$307.50) per validator\n- **Treasury also receives 25% less funding** (maintaining the current reward/treasury ratio)\n\n## Why This Makes Kusama Stronger\n\n### 1. **Attracts Professional Operators**\nHigher rewards mean validators can afford enterprise-grade hardware, redundant connections, and 24/7 monitoring. This improves network reliability for everyone.\n\n### 2. **Enables True Decentralization**\nWith sustainable economics, we can achieve meaningful geographic distribution beyond just EU/USA datacenters. Validators in Singapore, São Paulo, Nairobi, and beyond become economically viable.\n\n### 3. **Reduces Inflation Without Compromising Security**\nLess KSM minted means less sell pressure, while 500 professional validators provide more than enough security and redundancy for our network.\n\n### 4. **Creates a Competitive, Merit-Based System**\nValidators must earn their position through quality service, not just by running minimal setups. This drives innovation and excellence.\n\n## Implementation: Thoughtful and Measured\n\nWe propose a **phased approach** to ensure smooth transition:\n\n- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3):** Reduce to 750 validators\n\n- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6):** Reduce to 500 validators\n\n**Safety Measures:**\n- Continuous monitoring of network health metrics\n- Community checkpoints at each phase\n\n## Addressing Concerns Proactively\n\n**\"Won't this centralize the network?\"**\n500 professional validators running quality infrastructure provide **better** decentralization than 1,000 validators where many struggle to maintain uptime. Quality over quantity has always been Kusama's way.\n\n**\"What about smaller validators?\"**\nThe increased rewards make it easier for dedicated smaller operators to compete. Those running validators as a hobby can still participate through nomination pools.\n\n**\"Is 500 validators enough?\"**\nLeading networks operate successfully with similar numbers. Polkadot has 600 validators, Cosmos has ~175, and they maintain excellent security and uptime.\n\n## The Path Forward\n\nThis proposal represents a **win-win-win** scenario:\n- **Validators win** with sustainable economics\n- **Token holders win** with reduced inflation\n- **The network wins** with higher quality infrastructure\n\nKusama has always been about bold moves that strengthen our ecosystem. This optimization continues that tradition - making our network more attractive to professional operators while improving token economics for all holders.\n\n## Let's Build a Stronger Kusama Together\n\nVote **YES** to:\n- ✅ Increase validator rewards by 50%\n- ✅ Reduce KSM inflation by 25%\n- ✅ Attract world-class infrastructure providers\n- ✅ Enable true global decentralization\n- ✅ Create sustainable validator economics\n\nThe future of Kusama is in our hands. Let's make it stronger, more sustainable, and ready for the challenges ahead.\n\n",

      "content": "> Proponents argue that foundations offer better alignment with tokenholders because foundations lack shareholders and can focus exclusively on maximizing network value. \n\n> But this theory overlooks how organizations actually function. Removing the equity-based incentives of corporations doesn’t eliminate misalignment — it often institutionalizes it. Without a profit motive, foundations lack clear feedback loops, direct accountability, and market-enforced discipline. The foundation funding model is one of patronage: Tokens are allocated and then sold for fiat, and that capital is spent without a clear mechanism to tie expenditures to outcomes. \n\n> **People spending other people’s money, with minimal accountability, rarely optimize for impact.**\n\n...\n\n> **A better, simpler alternative: Companies**\n\nhttps://rfc.decent.partners/t/mint-7-040-870-kab-to-decent-partners/73\n\n> This proposal aligns to ongoing work to create a legal and technical structure that links existing Kabocha tokens to equity or equity-like rights in Decent Partners Ltd potentially with programmable features, while ensuring compliance with existing and emerging regulations.\n\n> The primary aim is to iterate towards a model where tokens are bearer assets - representing legally enforceable rights/obligations in the Decent Partners network public company.\n",

This enables protocols deployed on AH to create new deflation mechanisms.\nThis system is compatible with the configurable treasury burn, meaning a future proposal could configure the treasury burn to be directed to the dark hole pallet.\n\nFuture changes to the pallet could include an \"event horizon\" or \"radiation\" that allows part of the burn to \"escape\"/be directed to fund other initiatives as per [previous WFC](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/437)",

      "title": "Develop a mechanism to lock a percentage of staking rewards as set out in the details of this referendum",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nThere were discussions about reducing Kusama's inflation in a similar manner to the reduction on Polkadot.  On Polkadot, it was anticipated that by reducing token supply with constant demand that we would see an increase in the token price.  This expected result was not observed.  \n\nAs a further result of reducing inflation on Polkadot, staking rewards were also decreased.  If applied to Kusama this would be disastrous to nominators; they would earn fewer rewards through inflation and also face further reduced rewards as validators apply higher levels of commissions to meet operational costs.\n\nI believe we can maintain existing (or even higher) levels of inflation if we focus on reducing the transferable supply of staking rewards instead of reducing issuance.  While the locked tokens can't be sold, they can be used to stake or in governance, similar to existing governance locks.  It is important for the security of the network that these locked tokens have some anticipated value.  We can, at a later date, look at methods and conditions for unlocking tokens in a manner that won't introduce a supply shock.\n\n**This \"out of the box\" concept is (in my opinion) well paired with Kusama's original experimental theme.**\n\nRequest:\n\n- Develop functionality to lock a percentage of staking rewards\n- This should be driven by a storage value with an initial setting of 0 (all transferable)\n- The community should be able to vote on this value via the root track\n- Validators should receive fully transferable staking rewards up to the maximum commission\n- Functionality should be scheduler friendly, such that we can increase or decrease the amount by increments over time\n\nIf this proposal is passed it is my intention to follow-up with other proposals which seek to further define functionality surrounding these locked tokens as well as to suggest other avenues of use.\n\nRegards,\nWill\n",

      "content": "## **Context**\n\n* [Original Karam post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/reflections-on-the-dv-program-so-far-whats-next/13046)\n* [Daniel's response](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/reflections-on-the-dv-program-so-far-whats-next/13046/34)\n\n---\n\n## **TL;DR**\n\nUse Cohort 5 of Decentralized Voices to kickstart a new generation of emergent, resilient, on-chain political parties, enabled by the addition of **[Kreivo](https://github.com/virto-network/kreivo)’s OpenGov-based infrastructure** to the **Kusama Asset Hub** runtime through a new upgrade.\n\n---\n\n## **Problem**\n\nPolkadot (including Kusama) is evolving from selling products to selling **[resilience](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/fBckztFH7u4)** as the technology’s main value proposition.\n\n* It offers **Web3’s most progressive, experimental, and rapidly evolving on-chain governance stack**.\n* An **emerging ecosystem of DAOs/collectives/on-chain organisations** is beginning to take form.\n\nRather than copying or competing with EVM-based projects, Polkadot has the opportunity to lean into its **unique capabilities**, doubling down on **DAOs** as the network’s equivalent of dApps.\n\n### Key Building Blocks:\n\n* **OpenGov** – Polkadot’s modular on-chain governance system\n* **Kreivo** – Generalised OpenGov for programmable, extensible DAOs\n* **Decentralized Voices (DV)** – An initiative for kickstarting collectives\n\n---\n\n## **Challenges**\n\n### **1. Lack of Resilience in Current DVs**\n\nMost depend on:\n\n* **Multisigs**\n* **Proxies**\n* **Bots connected to centralized servers (e.g., Discord)**\n\n➡️ This contrasts sharply with Polkadot’s value proposition of **resilience**.\n\n### **2. Misalignment of Strengths**\n\nPolkadot’s biggest advantage is building **full-stack DAO infrastructure**—but current DVs are not using it to its potential.\n\n---\n\n## **The Opportunity**\n\nAcross four cohorts, DVs have matured and now require:\n\n* Identifiable decision makers\n* Configurable governance structures\n* Budget and team management tools\n\n### W3F can now:\n\n* Use the DV program to **educate** and **create** **resilient, accessible, performant DAOs** leveraging Kreivo pallets to offer a generalised version OpenGov.\n\n---\n\n## **Addressing Technical Limitations**\n\nCurrently:\n\n* **Kusama and Polkadot Asset Hubs** have limited DAO functionality\n* Without action, existing governance/DAO experience and narrative advantages will be ceded to the broader market. \n\n> ✅ **Good news**: Virto's **Kreivo parachain** has already built a modular DAO stack based on OpenGov:\n\n* **Token-less, wallet-less onboarding**\n* **Escrow and pass-key integrations**\n* **KSM as fee token**\n\n---\n\n## **Addressing Communication Challenges**\n\n* W3F & Parity are consolidating functionality into Kusama/Polkadot Asset Hubs\n* But are resource-constrained + not active users of these tools\n* **Kreivo** and **Kusama Asset Hub** are separate networks, confusing users, despite Kreivo using KSM as its fee token.\n\n➡️ We must **unify talent, technology, and narrative** to strengthen the ecosystem.\n\n---\n\n## **Vision: Real Network Political Parties**\n\nWe propose a **cultural and technical upgrade**:\n\n* Evolve DVs into **resilient, on-chain political parties**\n* Represent the **multidimensional spectrum** of token holders (e.g., interest-based, region-based etc)\n\n### Requirements for DVs:\n\n* Must be **real DAOs**\n* Must have a **manifesto** tied to a part of the token holder spectrum\n* Must avoid relying on centralised tools (e.g., Discord bots, multisigs)\n* Must use **new Kusama AH DAO infrastructure**: governance tracks, budgets, teams, etc.\n\n---\n\n## **Technical Requirements**\n\nPropose **runtime upgrade to Kusama Asset Hub**, incorporating the following Kreivo-based `Polkadot SDK` & [frame-contrib](https://github.com/virto-network/frame-contrib/) pallets:\n\n* 📜 **`pallet-referenda`** (additional instance) for DAO proposals\n* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **`pallet-nfts`** ([pending feature](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8796)) for DAO memberships\n* 🏛️ **`pallet-communities`** for DAO governance and membership\n* 🎛️ **`pallet-referenda-tracks`** for dynamic governance configurations\n\n ✅ Solves Kusama’s **DAO tooling gap**\n\n ✅ Fixes **bounty system limitations** (mandated accounts can’t hold DOT or pay stablecoins)\n\n**Soon:** **[XCMv5](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/xcm-format/issues/60) (~1 month)** will allow Kusama DAOs to interact with **Polkadot governance**, unlocking full cross-chain coordination.\n\n---\n\n## **How It Could Work**\n\n1. **W3F outlines the vision**: future DVs should evolve into on-chain political parties.\n2. **Spectrum mapping**: identify the types of representation desired by token holders (e.g., interest-based, geography-based).\n3. **Set clear requirements**:\n\n   * Every DV = a DAO, regardless of size\n   * Every DAO = clear manifesto\n   * Every DAO = on-chain, resilient infrastructure\n4. **Launch with upgraded Kusama AH runtime**:\n\n   * Support self-governance, strategy-setting, budget/team management\n   * Position DVs as resilient political forces within the network\n\n---\n\n## **Phased Approach**\n\n1. **Runtime Upgrade**:\n\n   * Add Kreivo pallets to Kusama Asset Hub\n\n2. **Research Phase**:\n\n   * W3F + ecosystem map token holder spectrum\n\n3. **Initial DV Setup**:\n\n   * W3F defines a few example DAOs along ideological lines\n   * Hand control to elected/appointed stewards\n\n4. **Bootstrapping Leadership**:\n\n   * Determine leaders for new political parties\n   * W3F retains membership (initially) for oversight\n   * Training wheels removed over time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "![Birdbrain.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmb7HMSRzpeob2n3YUCnN8JGPQJUq7XmUd5SG2bX43kBCR)\n\n## TL;DR\n\nFollowing the passing of Kusama’s brand evolution ([ref 492](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/492)) and the Web3 Foundation’s commitment to an independent Kusama ([ref 498](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/498)), this proposal seeks a mandate to establish **[Birdbrain](https://postimg.cc/23WWsc39)**, a leaderless Krievo-based collective, as Kusama’s _on-chain innovation agency_. \n\nBirdbrain aims to coordinate some of the 10M DOT pledged by the W3F to drive tangible progress, uniting KSM holders, ecosystem stakeholders and new talent under a banner of bold innovation underpinned by real commercial impact. \n\n## Why Birdbrain?\n\nKusama was born with an experimental, chaotic ethos that first attracted artists, hackers and builders - but it has been hampered by fragmented efforts, unclear coordination and erratic funding. \n\nBirdbrain addresses this by:\n\n- **Uniting talent:** Bringing together a fluid collective of existing and emerging Kusama contributors to structure development and communications through the [full innovation cycle](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/structuring-support-across-a-full-innovation-cycle/3170), from curiosity-driven experiments, through directed and applied research, into product development and commercialisation.\n\n- **Coordinating chaos:** Unlike Polkadot’s _domain_ specific bounties, Birdbrain offers Kusama a simple, adaptable and always open on-chain agency that nudges diverse talent towards a coherent _direction_. \n\n## Flipping the Bird\n\nPolkadot targets enterprises with its [Cloud and Hub](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/the-polkadot-cloud/10670) narratives. \n\nKusama, through Birdbrain, takes a different approach:\n\n- **A cultural symbol:** Just as Nike’s Swoosh became a universal mark of athletic performance through a decades long relationship with agency [Wieden+Kennedy](https://www.wk.com/), Birdbrain will reforge the Kusama bird into an emblem of hacker ingenuity, attitude and resourcefulness.\n- **A creative hub:** With people desperate for alternatives to broken systems, Birdbrain will turn Kusama’s cutting-edge tech into resonant ideas, experiments, and initiatives—bridging crypto and the wider world.\n\n![create chaOS.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTsuf3fj7CEfZ188mnEA7SfaRHLDzDiBHoJbQt7cEeo4K)\n\n## Birdbrain’s coordinating idea\n\nWe’re evolving the passive “expect chaos” into an active call to arms: **create chaOS.**\n\nKusama isn’t just a network, it’s an _operating system_ for challenging the status quo. \n\nWith the bird as our badge, Birdbrain will empower creators, hackers and visionaries to challenge conventions through bold, disruptive experiments.\n\n![chaOS structure.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZuykPCHcErKr287GF82pZxXnUeQ8RheBe9EsZMQAqEVp)\n\n## What Birdbrain can become\n\nBirdbrain will be an emergent experiment that can evolve into a multi-faceted face of the network:\n\n- **Collective**: A [Krievo](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/kusama-2025-private-daos-regional-chains-lip-and-more/11394)-organised entity driving Kusama adoption.\n\n- **Brand**: A unifying voice for Kusama’s diverse ecosystem.\n\n- **Bounty**: Seeded with Kusama's native stablecoin [dUSD](https://taniko.soda.zone/assets/urn:ocn:kusama:1000/50000002) from W3F and/or other sources.\n\n- **Agency**: Setting and executing a clear network strategy.\n\n- **Bridge**: Making Kusama stand apart in crypto and stand out in the _real world_.\n\n- **Product**: Simplifying onboarding for contributors and users.\n\n- **Template**: A replicable model for others to adopt.\n\n- **Platform**: An open-source destination for developers to create experimental decentralised applications, with an emphasis on privacy, freedom and programmable cryptography.\n\n## Principles of Birdbrain\n\nBirdbrain is driven by the following principles and aims. It is…\n\n- **Sustainable**: Generating real income from its endeavours.\n\n- **Regenerative**: It requests funding from the W3F or Kusama treasury not as a grant but as an _advance_ that is repaid to the treasury with yield generated by dUSD ([ref 471](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/471)), incentivising the collective to drive native stablecoin adoption. \n\n- **Optimistic**: Using lean governance, proposals pass unless opposed, fostering shared responsibility.\n\n- **Leaderless**: Whoever knows the next step leads, relying on collective intelligence over fixed roles.\n\n- **Equitable**: Sharing value transparently among members.\n\n- **Diverse**: Supporting talent and projects across the stack and through the innovation process.\n\n- **Supportive**: Prioritising consistent collaboration over short term projects.\n\n- **Scalable**: When needed Birdbrain will spin out subsidiary organisations that can also do the same in a waterfalling structure, whilst maintaining coherence between entities.  \n\n- **Experimental**: Embracing risk by testing novel ideas, talent and mechanisms on-chain.\n\n## Membership and onboarding\n\nBirdbrain is developing an experimental _initiative based governance structure_, with membership contingent not on reputation or on votes from token holders, but on the submission of original ideas, visuals, concepts or artifacts as tribute to the network.\n\nThis _cultural collateral_ is minted as 1 of 1 NFTs and held in a network reserve by the organisation on behalf of Kusama and represents the emerging creative soul of the collective and its contributing members.\n\nThe first artifact will be the iconic canary, with the broad church of Kusama token holders taking the first seat in the Krievo collective and receiving 1 vote. \n\nThe second artifact will be the create chaOS idea, which will be submitted by [Decent Partners](https://decent.partners).\n\nIf this artifact is accepted by KSM holders, Decent Partners will be added as the second member of the collective, giving the initiative its founding impetus.  \n\n## Objectives\n\n1. **Activate Funds:** Receive some of 10M DOT from the W3F commitment.\n2. **Redefine Kusama:** Shift communications from a canary network to a peer network.\n3. **Remind the bird how to fly:** (Re)ignite Kusama’s potential as a cultural force.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nIf approved, Birdbrain will work with the Web3 Foundation and Kusama community to structure the deployment of some of the 10M DOT, ensuring alignment with the network’s new independent positioning.\n",

      "content": "## Track: Wish-for-change\n\nShort description: Request 10 million DOT from Web3 Foundation to fulfill the commitment of allocating 1% of genesis DOT to Kusama, provide support for bleeding-edge building including ZK innovation, and transition Kusama away from being purely Polkadot’s canary network.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis referendum seeks community approval for a new vision for Kusama, consisting of three key points\n\n1.  Deploy 10 million DOT from Web3 Foundation for the sole benefit of Kusama, in order to boost the utility and broad value proposition of the Kusama network\n    \n2.  Direct the W3F to use some of this 10 million DOT in support of advanced technology for Kusama, such as ZK technologies, to build Kusama into a major ZK experimentation bed\n    \n3.  Recognise that Kusama is no longer merely a canary network and instead should be treated as an experiment-centric peer network of Polkadot\n    \n\nAt the launch of Kusama, one percent of genesis DOT tokens (10 million DOT) were promised for use by the Kusama network. With the Polkadot-Kusama bridge now operational, Web3 Foundation seeks to fulfill this commitment and use ten million of its DOT for the support of Kusama.\n\nKusama was initially conceived and used as a canary network for Polkadot - a network with real economic value that could host new features, runtime upgrades, parameter changes, etc. before they were implemented on Polkadot. As Polkadot has become more mature, this has become less necessary, and it is time for Kusama to evolve.\n\nIf this Referendum passes, Web3 Foundation will take it as community approval to move forward with its plan, outlined below.\n\n[Gavin Wood presentation at DOTCon 0.5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmSoHbVGo4k&t=191s)\n\n[Gavin Wood Interview with The Kus (Space Monkeys 121)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvbsSq1a_8g&t=5522s)\n\n[Polkadot OpenDev Fellowship Call - May 2024](https://www.youtube.com/live/War1weBu7yU?t=3070s)\n\n## Vision\n\nKusama was conceived as Web3’s “chaotic” testing ground, a “canary network” to push technological boundaries without the constraints of Polkadot’s stability requirements. This proposal seeks to reignite Kusama’s experimental ethos while leveraging its maturity to establish it as an experimental testbed for zero-knowledge (ZK) innovation and other cutting-edge use cases.\n\nWe seek to reignite Kusama’s original spirit as Web3’s boldest experimentation platform to empower builders and accelerate technical innovation. We want to revive its foundational ethos as an unshackled Web3 experimental hub. We want to encourage bold building on the bleeding edge.\n\nTherefore, Web3 Foundation seeks to use 10 million DOT to incentivize and remove barriers for builders on Kusama. The exact mechanisms will vary, but will all share a common goal - make Kusama the place for developers who want to push forward into the future.\n\ntl;dr: We would like to return Kusama to its origins, while simultaneously providing the foundation for it to evolve towards the future. No promises. Expect chaos.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWeb3 Foundation proposes to use 10 million DOT tokens from its own Treasury (not the on-chain Polkadot Treasury, Kusama Treasury, or other sources) for the express benefit of the Kusama ecosystem, including the relay chain, system parachains, other parachains, and projects focused on Kusama.\n\nThis would not be a one-time transfer of DOT to Kusama but would take place over the course of at least two years.\n\nThe DOT may be used for initiatives such as the following. Note that this is meant to be a representative sampling of possible initiatives, and W3F is not limited to the below, nor is this meant to indicate that these specific types of initiatives will occur.\n\n-   Direct transfer of DOT to the on-chain Kusama Treasury\n-   Funding of Kusama-based Bounty programs, collectives, DAOs, and other collective decision-making on Kusama\n-   Support for Kusama-focused projects, events, conferences, workshops, etc.\n-   Prizes for hackathons, competitions, etc. for projects building on Kusama\n-   Grants for projects building on Kusama\n-   Subsidized or free parathread reservation, runtime storage, and other costs for running parachains or other projects on Kusama\n\nAmong the projects we are interested in supporting is providing support for various ZK projects on Kusama. Some possible examples include:\n\n-   Establishing grants for projects building zk-focused dApps, scalable ZK rollups, and cross-chain ZK proofs, especially for the Kusama Hub\n-   Funding ZK-focused parachains, runtime modules, and developer tooling\n-   Partnering with academic institutions and others to host ZK hackathons and workshops on Kusama\n\nOther ideas include, but are not limited to, support for generative and other types of on-chain art, proof of personhood, and social experiments.\n\nAll projects, both ZK and otherwise, being built on Kusama using these DOT must be used strictly for legal purposes and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nApproving this Referendum acknowledges that the Kusama community would like to see Kusama on the path towards being an experiment-centric network in its own right.\n\nFinally, this proposal should not be seen as detailed instructions or steps to be taken, but rather as a vision to be worked toward and a confirmation by the Kusama community that it shares this vision. If it is approved, Web3 Foundation will seek more feedback from the community and provide more details on explicit steps to be taken.",

See [here](https://trademarks.justia.com/owners/web-3-0-technologies-foundation-4403169/). \n\n**So this WFC could in effect be W3F agreeing to license the kusama (whatever is in the brand trademark/IP) to relevant counter-parties to this WFC (for example Decent Partners)**\n\nIt should be seen as the first in an evolving series that seeks to iterate towards creative control and strategic direction of the network moving under the oversight of OpenGov.\n\nIf the WFC passes an 'official' RFP can follow. \n\nThe period of the WFC can be used to iterate on the basic RFP and clarify questions around the brand.\n\nThe [RFP outline](https://rfc.decent.partners/t/wip-request-for-proposal-rfp-kusama-brand-hack/68) is currently v 0.1.  All changes to the RFP during the WFC period can be tracked on the main post.\n\nIt is a **work in progress** - the contents, structure and process are **subject to discussion**  **including costs**. \n\nAll ideas and improvements encouraged.\n\n------\n\n### RFP summary\n\nKusama invites a global network of designers, brand strategists and creative talent to submit proposals for the design evolution of Kusama.\n\n\n",

Amend Asset Conversion Pallet to enable synchronous management of asset pairs by two separate accounts rather than a single entity. This would enable Brale to add dUSD and KSM Collective to add KSM. LP fees would be split evenly to each contributing party. \n2. Wait for smart contracts on Kusama AH (Q1 2025) and abstract the required logic into a specific contract, enabling the same outcome as 1.  \n3. Send the KSM from KSM Collective to Brale who add the liquidity as a single account owner. An agreement would be arranged for 50% of the LP fees to be sent back to KSM Collective. For regulatory and compliance reasons Brale will not be able to move dUSD to KSM Collective. \n\n### Additional context\n\nKusama is not currently serviced by a DEX with single sided liquidity so we feel 1 would not compete with an incumbent offering. \n\n1. addresses the issue at source and potentially enables more innovation to come to Kusama AH but is predicated on pushing a change in the runtime via The Fellowship.\n\n2. is optimised for simplicity and permissionless innovation, but will require work from Virto’s team on the contracts - we also need to wait for contracts to be live.\n\n3. Is best for speed - however it adds some off-chain bureaucracy and reduces the function of KSM Collective as a direct agent in the network. \n\nIn the absence of clear direction we will likely opt for speed and go with option 3 - with an understanding that the structure approved by OpenGov is changing.\n\nThis will allow us to get the pair up and working, we can then address the lower level issues after. \n\n### Alternatives\n\nWe may be missing an obvious alternative, feel free to comment with your thoughts. \n",

Ideally coretime price should counter the money spent printing money paying validators.\n\nA \"funny\" side effect of coretime being basically free is the trend of people buying every core available, it's a minor thing but it can get become inconvenient, specially for new builders ... you know, the people we want to attract instead of scaring away. I must admit I started this trend assuming it would trigger a price adjustment but later realize that's not how the price adapter works so it just meant inconvenience, in my defense I transferred cores to those who needed it(not every hoarder will do the same) and I'm building infrastructure to allow projects scale their organization to their own \"satellite chain\" where infrastructure and coretime is managed for them.\n\nHow do we solve this? With a better pricing system of course, one that takes more factors into account like the reality of the market and demand for our blockspace. In the meantime however a simple change that improves our pricing problems can be to set a minimum to how low the price of a core can get. \nHow much is a good minimum? we can discuss endlessly about it but for now I would propose a minimum from the experience of a builder and a hoarder: **10KSM**, even with KSM price increasing x10 it would still be reasonable for builders and it also keeps a number of hoarders away(e.g. it was ok to pay 10 KSM for all available cores but 500+ KSM not).\n\n> The respective changes to the Polkadot SDK and the Kusama runtime would be covered by myself or our trusted fellow Pablo.",

      "title": "Make the DAO Hub Kreivo a system chain",
      "content": "First, we want to thank the Kusama community for their recent support on the \"[Revitalizing Kusama: the DAO hub](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/452)\" proposal. Your feedback was invaluable, and we listened carefully to your questions and suggestions. Several times we were asked if the Virto team would consider making Kreivo a system chain. We've thought about it deeply, and this proposal is our response to that frequently asked question.\n\n## Goal of the proposal\n- Determine whether Kreivo, the DAO Hub, should become a system parachain\n\nKreivo is parachain made possible by you KSM token holders who supported the Virto t̶e̶a̶m̶DAO, it allows anyone to create and manage autonomous organizations, provides a robust payments infrastructure, smart contracts(for DAOs only), great UX for DAO members not requiring fees nor wallets(supports passkeys), and all of this using KSM as its native token.\n\n## Why a system parachain\n\nKreivo is an ideal candidate for becoming a system parachain because it provides essential infrastructure for DAOs within the Kusama ecosystem. As a system parachain, Kreivo could offer deeper integration with Kusama's governance, enabling more efficient and seamless operation of DAOs. This would strengthen Kusama's position as a hub for decentralized governance and potentially attract more teams and entrepreneurs to the network.\nMoreover, Kreivo's use of KSM as its native token aligns perfectly with Kusama's tokenomics, ensuring that increased activity on Kreivo directly benefits the entire Kusama ecosystem. Read more about [Kreivo's sustainability model](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/sustainability-model-of-a-tokenless-protocol/8683) through the sell of memberships and advanced payment fees.\n\n## Root origin and the DAO Alliance\n\nKreivo from its conception has already behaved like a system chain, the only big difference being its Root origin was set to be a governance track controlled by a ranked collective formed by all the DAOs registered in the system, a *DAO Alliance*. After becoming a system chain Kreivo would change its root origin to be the parent chain, requiring future upgrades to be conducted via Kusama OpenGov. However we would still keep the DAO ranked collective and its treasury to oversee certain aspects of the protocol, like the minting and pricing of new memberships or configuring certain system payment fees.\n\n## Background\n\nKreivo is already helping the Kusama ecosystem:\n- It lets people create and manage DAOs with just 1 KSM\n- It uses KSM as its native token, providing new utility\n- It works well with Kusama's current governance system(using OpenGov components for DAO governance)\n- It gives developers a chance to monetize smart-contracts and sell them to organizations(only DAOs can instantiate contracts)\n- It brings real-world businesses thanks to its UX improvements and abstractions.\n\nWe look forward to your vote and feedback on this proposal.",

      "content": "Update 3.9.24\n\nadded:\n\nBallpark costs\n\nEstimate $20-40k depending on eventual complexity. \n\n### TL:DR\n\nThis wish for change seeks approval to develop and then integrate a new type of liquidity pool for asset hub that would enable early stage teams to leverage their native asset to bootstrap initial funding in a highly capital efficient, fair and sustainable manner\n\nThis strategy aims to create tighter economic alignment between the treasury, native stablecoin integrations and next generation parachain teams focused on meaningful adoption of the technology rather than a race to listings before attempting to backfill adoption into overly inflated expectations.\n\nTeams would begin with an LBP style launch and then have the ability to progress to listings on asset conversion pallet before later launching on mainstream exchanges.\n\n### Polkadot 1.0\n\nPolkadot 1.0 was oriented around onboarding parachains via crowd loans and auctions.\n\nTeams raised funding for development through **external financing** and marketed their native tokens and use-cases to KSM and DOT holders who received the new network assets when they agreed to lock up their tokens to help teams secure 1 year leases on Kusama or 2 years leases on Polkadot.\n\nIn this model value accrued to parachain teams and individual KSM/DOT holders contributing to crowd-loans.\n\nCommon good treasuries received no upside exposure in this design.\n\nThe economic incentives of crowd loans provided the ecosystem’s primary marketing.\n\n### Polkadot 2.0\n\nIn [Polkadot 2.0](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-2-0-definition/7673) crowd-loans have been replaced by **coretime sales**.\n\nKSM/DOT are now used to **purchase** blockspace.\n\nThis network income is burned - turning opportunity costs into direct costs.\n\nCoretime income now gives an **objective measure of demand** for Polkadot’s primary product.\n\n_However_... it also removes speculative incentives of crowd loans that enabled first generation parachains to raise development funding and kickstart their economies.\n\n### Asset Conversion Pallet\n\nThe introduction of [asset conversion pallet](https://docs.rs/pallet-asset-conversion/7.0.0/pallet_asset_conversion/) (ACP) to Kusama and Polkadot Asset Hubs (k/pAH) was designed to concentrate functionality, simplify asset-swaps and speed up external exchange integrations as asset owners can use Asset Hub to track information the total issuance of their asset in the entire network.\n\nIt has also set the stage for a new class of Papi/Smoldot based DEXs such as [Kheoswap](https://kheopswap.xyz/).\n\nACP pallet is based on Uniswap V2 logic and allows assets to be converted from one type to another by means of **a constant product formula**. \n\nConstant product formula's are not that capital efficient, especially for bootstrapping new tokens with low liquidity and introduce issues such as front-running and the ability for whales to secure large amounts of a new tokens issuance.\n\n### Parachains 2.0\n\nIn the absence of the short-term speculative incentives of crowd loans, coretime customers are now required to create real economic value to sustain their direct costs.\n\nThere is not the same hype and market that first kickstarted parachains and so we should see this as an opportunity to create a more progressive and aligned mechanism for the **funding**, **listing** and **focused adoption** of next generation networks.\n\n### Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools (LBP)\n\nLiquidity bootstrapping pools as pioneered by [Balancer](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/pools/liquidity-bootstrapping.html#starting-capital-can-be-small) and also implemented in [Basilisk’s Kusama parachain](https://docs.bsx.fi/product_snek_lbp/) enable the fairest and most capital efficient method of price discovery for new tokens.\n\nRather than using **a constant product formula** like Uniswap (ACP) pools can **dynamically change token weighting** (e.g 1/99 to 99/1 for TokenA/TokenB) using weighted math with time-dependent weights. The starting and end weights and times are selected by the pool owner, who also has the power to pause swaps.\n\nThe benefits of this model are:\n\n**Sell Pressure**\n\n- During a weight shift, the token price of one token experiences sell pressure while the other experiences buy pressure. When this is mixed with modest swap volume, the price approaches the generally agreed-upon market price.\n\n**Fair Market**\n\n- LBPs often start with intentionally high prices. This strongly disincentivizes whales and bots from snatching up much of the pool liquidity at the get-go. When LBPs are used for early-stage tokens, this can help increase how widespread the token distribution is.\n\n**Starting Capital Can Be Small**\n\n- Teams who use LBPs to kickstart the liquidity of a token that has not been well distributed yet can do so with minimal starting capital. For a team running an LBP with their TOKEN and STABLECOIN, starting with 10% or 20% STABLECOIN, as opposed to 50% STABLECOIN like they might need on another platform, significantly reduces their starting capital requirements. \n \n**Examples**\n\n - [Fjord Foundry](https://fjordfoundry.com/pools) LBP platform\n - [Gitcoin Akita/ETH LBP](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-lbps-and-the-akita-inu-saga-15fe5cc99154)\n \n### Adding a bespoke LBP design to Kusama AH.\n\nIntroducing a bespoke LBP design to Kusama Asset Hub in the same manner as ACP reworked Uniswap v2, would lower barriers to entry for teams wishing to launch on coretime and smooth their path to liquidity in ACP and eventual CEX listings enabled by AH.\n\nUltimately we are iterating the underlying technical architecture to enable more finely tuned **innovation support phases** that will in turn ensure better conditions for teams looking to launch and sustain projects alongside generating more tangible value for the underlying network. \n\n### Treasury participation w/ Krievo structuring\n\nPolkadot’s evolving on-chain governance capabilities - such as those offered by [Krievo's parachain and operating system](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/kusama-lives-and-makes-creativity-possible-by-virto/4539) unlocks the potential to construct and mediate more balanced economic arrangements than were possible in its initial iteration of crowd-loans.\n\nWith this in mind, the introduction of an LBP type structure would introduce a useful new tool for common-good treasuries to support and gain exposure to projects focused on meaningful adoption rather than hollow speculation.\n\n### R&D\n\nAs a member of The Fellowship, [Daniel](https://github.com/olanod) from the Virto/Krievo team has agreed to lead the research and hopefully the eventual implementation of this WFC if it is approved.\n\nAs a member of The Fellowship, [Daniel](https://github.com/olanod) from the Virto/Krievo team has agreed to lead the research and hopefully the eventual implementation of this WFC if it is approved.\n\n### Ballpark costs\n\nEstimate $20-40k depending on eventual complexity. \n\n### Related reading \n\n[Uni-LBP](https://github.com/kadenzipfel/uni-lbp) - A capital-efficient Uniswap v4 liquidity bootstrapping pool (LBP) hooks contract. \n",

This is only one metric that can't be abused. \n\nFor examle there are 3 chains on kusama: A, B, C chain. (during period of 28 days)a\n\nA contains on severign account 10K ksm\n\nB contains on severign account 70K ksm\n\nC contains on severign account 20K ksm\n\nSo in total 100K KSM bridged from Kusama relay chain to rollups. Each of them will be rewarded proportionally on the sovereign accounts.\n\n10% to A, 70% to B, 20% to C.\n\nKSM for insentivice is from treasury and could be any what KUSAMA open gov will decide. for example\n\n— % from all KSM in treasury.\n\n— % from KSM collected during month,\n\n— % from KSM that suppose to be burned as not spended.\n\nThe distribution to parachain/rollups could/should be done automaticly depends how many KSM on sovereign account was each block during the some period.\n\nIt could be done via extra pallet that check balances on sovereigns accounts each block and distribute KSM incentives to that accounts proportionally for total KSM during spending period duration.\n\nThis is the best and the fastest way to drive development activity and real product on kusama.  \n  \n\nAs open gov we still can try to fund some pallet developments, marketing but at the end of final use case for relay chain native currency is bridging as much as possible KSM to parachain/rollups.   \n  \nTo not let abuse the system of insentivise and not drive up only LSD via parachain/sovereign account — could be good to just apply some formula to that balance of sovereign parachain account that pull down total share of such LSD parachain use cases.",

      "title": "WFC: Negotiate a $30m structured financing deal between Kusama and ABO Digital to acquire stablecoins for the AH treasury via a series of strategic draw downs over the next 3-5 years.",
      "content": "# WFC TL:DR\n\nThe simple Y/N is:\n\nShould we continue/conclude negotiations with ABO Digital to secure $30m of guaranteed stablecoin financing over the next 3-5 years for Kusama ecosystem development?\n\n## Stablecoins\n\nThere is general agreement that it would be beneficial to acquire stablecoins for the Kusama/Polkadot treasuries for the following reasons:\n\n- Improve conditions for proposers and voters by removing extreme volatility from payments.\n- Diversify, structure and budget the treasury's holdings to provide strategic foundations for growth. \n\nPolkadot's asset hub treasury is steadily acquiring USDT/C via a fully on-chain and automated process utilsing Hydration's dollar-cost-averaging feature as outlined in this [proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/231). \n\n## Benefits\n\nThe benefits of this approach are: \n\n- **Low risk.** Dollar cost averaging aims to moderate the volatility of market cycles by enabling a steady  exchange of DOT to stablecoins.\n- **Automated.** Once approved, the parameters are effectively set and forget and the arrangement will execute predictably through the lifecycle of the on-chain agreement.\n- **No middle men**. The deal is executed completely on-chain and requires no intermediary or oversight.\n\n## Downsides\n\nThe downsides of this approach are: \n\n- **It is slow**.

Repatriate the funds - minus the operating requirements of Kappa Sigma Mu - via a ForceTransfer call on the Root track - boosting the treasury and indeed the amount available for the Stream track.\n2. Burn the funds via a ForceSetBalance call on the Root track, leaving the account with operating overhead.\n\n\n",
