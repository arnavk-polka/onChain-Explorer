Note that, in order for OpenGov to be fully operational, [the proposal upgrading collectives parachain](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/403) needs to be approved and enacted (this is ongoing). If this happens, Fellowship will be created in the Collectives parachain.

For one, it includes XCM v3.\n\nOn Statemint, this does not include NFT 2.0 or Foreign Assets as the Statemine release does, although with the audits completed these will be in an upcoming release. It does include the new runtime API to [query account balances](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/2455), which will return all the fungible assets (under the Balances pallet and both instances of the Assets pallet) that an account owns in a single RPC call. This should be particularly useful for front end developers.\n\n### External Motion\n\nPlease note this proposal is submitted as an external motion: meaning after/if Council approves, this submission will be up for vote in referenda queue for the community to have the final decision. It is a general expectation, given the size of the upgrade, for the community to vote on this for a complete launch period (28 days). \n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "Acala Foundation have registered para id 3336 and won a parachain slot auction by bidding with the intention to use the new lease to renew Acala para lease.\n\nHowever, due to [bug in Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7202), parachain 3336 can never produce valid block and therefore unable to perform lease swap action.\n\nThis proposal aims to perform lease swap between 2000 (Acala) and 3336 (parachain bid by Acala Foundation).\n\n---\n\n## Technical Details\n\nIn order to participate parachain auction, we need to register a parathread, which requires a genesis state and geensis wasm. However, it is time consuming to prepare those as the provided template project is not suitable for production usage and therefore we used a dummy wasm during registration.\n\nOnce we won the auction, we have created a new valid parachain wasm and use [`register.schedule_code_upgrade`](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/15425400-2) and[ `register.set_current_head`](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/15425407-2) to update the genesis wasm and genesis state for para 3336.\n\nThe state and wasm is correctly updated. However, there is an unexpected side effect. Due to bug [polkadot#7202](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7202), this set the upgrade go ahead signal. \n\nWhen the parachain is onboarded, the collator for para 3336 starts try to produce block but it failed with error:\n\n`[Parachain] panicked at 'No new validation function found in storage, GoAhead signal is not expected', /home/build/.cargo/git/checkouts/cumulus-59522f43471fa161/a3d6cd4/pallets/parachain-system/src/lib.rs:396:21`\n\nThis is because parachain received the upgrade go ahead signal and expecting it is during the runtime upgrade process, which is not the case. This caused the inherent to panic.\n\nIt is not possible to rescue the parachain from this state without intervene from relaychain and therefore we proposed this propsoal.",

      "title": "1kvP Validators Initiative: Increase Validators Active Set to 400",
      "content": "After the submission of [referendum 112](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/democracy/referendum/112), seeking to increase the validator active set to 500, the community discussed the possibility and the need of Polkadot increasing the validators set. \n\nFeedback from the proposals indicates two points:\n\n- There's interest with increasing the number of validators of the active set **but with increments**;\n\n- There needs to be some analysis on the effects of the increase to ensure there's no security concerns.\n\nThe results indicate that participating members would like to increase the active set to 400 with increments of 5 per era. They believe that this increase would not compromise the security of the chain and allow for natural (opportunistic) leveling as the set increases. Core developers have also agreed on similar increases by value: \n\n“With increasing to 500, the amount of DOT needed to acquire a validator will sharply reduce from 1.7 mDOT now, to just around 370 kDOT. We think this is overall unavoidable, but we would personally suggest first increasing to 400 and re-evaluate”\n\nThis proposal aims to increase the active set of validators by 5 per era, for 20 eras. The call also executes a one-time increase by 3 to reach 400 validators by the end of the 20 eras. Note that this initiative is submitted on behalf of a coalition of 1kvP validators.\n\n- Preimage Hash: `0xbacad43f5467717cb1edfba6317524dc1d24fe3246afbe6a8cea7ed5fae1ba5f`\n- Call data: [HERE](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/extrinsics/decode/0x1a0408070a0c010401000000014038000014000000fe070a14)\n\nPlease note this proposal is submitted as an external motion: meaning if/after Council approves, the community will vote in referenda queue for the final decision. \n\nMake sure to review and vote!",

The header was overwritten via [inherent transaction](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/transaction-types/#inherent-transactions) from the collator. This transaction was supposed to be rejected. Still, it was not rejected due to a Substrate bug: [https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9210](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9210)\nThe issue now needs to be fixed by re-executing one of two extrinsics from the previously executed referendum to set the correct header of the parachain.\n###\n**Impact**\n###\nThe network runtime is in the correct state after the execution of the previous proposal to reset the parachain. Still, due to the incorrect head, the parachain cannot produce blocks.\n###\n**Remedy**\n###\nThe execution of one of the extrinsic to set the Watr’s parachain (2,058) head from the previously executed governance proposal will fix the issue.\n###\n**Proof of Authencity**\n###\n`We confirm the intention to reset the head of the Watr parachain (id: 2058) to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a3a2baafaa9623dbeab06759b78f4bce878d0fbfeef992a546bce6670131e6103170a2e7597b7b7e3d84c05391d139a62b157e78786d8c082f29dcf4c11131400 to resolve the issue caused by a bug in the enactment of referendum 113`\n###\nSignature\n\n`0x9618272c953c90b67973d2525bead280ea74f71d0104b267767b9312f7785f28ec683f269d565d6faf4927faa4262730b4939e71fea292be50be7e5b1f9bb987`\n###\t\nBelow is the preimage:\n\n- Hash: `0xac9ff5733f194470235d78f67d56e656a0d8ee8a908dda7782d22ed2dfb9f9eb`\n\n- Extrinsic: `paras.forceSetCurrentHead`(2058, [newHead](https://github.com/Watr-Protocol/seedling/blob/main/watr-head-data))",

All technical details can be found in the [Bridge Hub Genesis release](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-bridge-hub-polkadot-v9382). The runtime is taken from the v9382 parachains release.\n\nThe BH will be the gateway between Polkadot and other networks, like Kusama and Ethereum. For now, the BH only contains some basic logic, and none of the bridge-specific pallets. Those will get added in future runtime upgrades; the goal of this proposal is to get approval from Polkadot stakeholders and launch a \"shell\" such that bridge teams can focus on releasing their bridge logic, not launching a parachain.\n\nThe BH will primarily act as a message routing system within the network and between others. For example, parachains can configure their XCMP routing to interpret `parents: 2` (indicating, \"go to another consensus system\") as something to send to the BH to handle. Likewise, the BH can handle incoming messages and route them to the correct parachain within Polkadot.\n\nOnce operational, a Polkadot<>Kusama bridge will allow more interaction between the networks. For example, from the Polkadot Collectives parachains, the Technical Fellowship can serve both Polkadot and Kusama; or the Kusama network (as a unit body) could join the Polkadot Alliance.",

      "content": "Contextual Information from the team, below:\n\n**Proposal**\n\nA proposal requested by the Watr team to reset the blockchain back to seedling. Contextual information can be found below.\n\n**Context**\n\nWe tried to reset a technical genesis (pre-commercial deployment of runtime) of Watr. The current parachain model doesn't allow privileged operations such as a reset without either tokens in the sudo account, on-chain governance accounts or relay chain governance. However the tokens generated in this genesis block are locked and unusable. So we are unable to perform the reset and progress to commercial deployment. As such the network is locked and unusable without intervention from relay chain governance.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe network is locked and cannot be used or reset without intervention from relay chain governance. Whilst Devnet is active, the reset will be purely a technical rollback since our Parachain has not gone live to user transactions or funds yet. There is no risk to other applications, other Parachains or the relay chain.\n\n**Remedy**\n\nWe have explored all other solutions and after discussion and advice from Parity experts, have created this proposal to reset the Parachain to seedling state so we can progress to commercial deployment of the Watr Parachain.\n\n**Proof of Authenticity**\n\nWe submit the following proof of authenticity, signed by the registrar of the Watr Parachain (id: 2058) `13DgtSygjb8UeF41B5H25khiczEw2sHXeuWUgzVWrFjfwcUH`,\n\n- Text: This proposal has been submitted to Polkadot governance by the Watr Team with pre-image hash `0x2929e149de9d487466fed4093f721f68cfcdce1600e8d44e4b5b5c725efebcc3`.

Increasing the bond size required to become a direct nominator from **100 DOT to 250 DOT**.\n\n3. **Enabling fast unstake** on Polkadot: this has been well tested in Kusama, and is ready to go 🚀.

Increasing the number of validator candidates **from 1200 to 1500** in anticipation of an increase in the active set of validators\n\n5. **Increasing the number of pools to 256**: given the successful launch of Pools so far on Polkadot, and the network having almost the full list of 128 pools, I propose doubling the maximum count again to 256.\n\nThe previous discussion on this proposal can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1650). \n\n- Call data: `0x1a000c28020100000007160100a89c13460200000000000000000000000001dc0500000000270b0001005039278c040000000000000000000001000100000000`\n\n- Call hash: `0x4d779af12cec076f6dfe5b6087746b501592222bbcee70ff6ec51825eb389dde`\n\nPreimage can be checked [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x1a000c28020100000007160100a89c13460200000000000000000000000001dc0500000000270b0001005039278c040000000000000000000001000100000000).\n\nPlease nots this is submitted as an external motion: meaning if/after Council approves, the proposal will need to be up for vote by the community in referenda queue for the final decision. \n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "title": "Fix genesis registration for Manta Parachain",
      "content": "A proposal requested by the Manta team to register a new genesis wasm. Contextual information below:\n\n**What Happened**\n\nOur parathread was registered on the Polkadot relaychain, obtained a parachain slot and was upgraded to a parachain. However, we encountered a minor setback when the genesis collators failed to produce blocks on the new chain. It turns out that the registration process contained incompatible genesis WASM and state files, which caused our parachain to be stuck at genesis.\n\n**Impact / why fast-track?**\n\nAfter the acquisition of a parachain slot, Manta Network’s core development team has begun a sequence for launching the network. Not having this parachain producing blocks would prevent and delay that launch. The extrinsics called in our proposal affect just our 2104 parachain and it has not completed genesis, so there are no XCMP channels to worry about either, the relaychain should be unaffected by this.\n\n**Remedy** \n\nAfter thorough investigation and collaboration with the Parity development team, we've identified a solution to the issue. With assistance from Polkadot governance, we can correct the incompatible parachain state & WASM files that were originally registered. This correction will not have any impact or loss of state since the chain has never produced any blocks. We believe that this is the most efficient and effective solution to get our parachain up and running.\n\n**Council Proposal**\n\nWe humbly request that the technical committee fast-track the proposal to register the correct genesis state and code on Polkadot. This will allow our collators to begin producing blocks.\n\nWe have submitted the Preimage for the below proposal:\n\nhash: `0x2d1b0d07d86ebe11297eb5a732d5d56e2b118eb1e8e55b0bdc801c5d313371c9`\n\nin extrinsic [https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/14362712-2](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/14362712-2) from the same account as was used to originally register the paraID/parathread in [https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/13905786-2](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/13905786-2).\n\n**Extrinsics called:**\n\n`batchAll()`\n\n`    - registrar::setCurrentHead(2104, corrected.state)`\n\n`    - paras::forceSetCurrentCode(2104, corrected.wasm)`\n\nNew WASM file can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta/actions/runs/4234987640).\n\nregistrar.paras(2104) => manager: 15ynbcMgPf7HbQErRz66RDLMuBVdcWVuURhR4SLPiqa6B8jx\n\nGist by the CEO of Manta Network Shumo Chu: [https://gist.github.com/stechu/9c97c7766951d377accd8835e5da79fb](https://gist.github.com/stechu/9c97c7766951d377accd8835e5da79fb)\n\nMessage Text:\n\n\"This shall serve to testify that the following Polkadot governance referendum has been initiated and is endorsed by the Manta Network team  - Referendum number: TBD - Proposal hash: 0x2d1b0d07d86ebe11297eb5a732d5d56e2b118eb1e8e55b0bdc801c5d313371c9 - Polkassembly discussion: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/362\"\n\nsignature from the account that registered paraID 2104: `0x2478a5e64e8c7915e12ca048a2dfb5d04ff97f188fc1f7948bd77c19446fd421af3555a96ebbb1720b7ac1c548877ff8fc9ad12dcbf095f0aef9d8f54b444087`",

      "content": "Based on the conversations the Zeitgeist team had with TC in the last days, and taking into account the same issue appeared for the team on Kusama and the fix was approved by the community (see [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/251)), this proposal is now submitted as external motion for consideration of the Council, before making it to referenda queue for the final decision. \n\nYou can find the contextual information on this proposal by the Zeitgeist team [HERE](https://hackmd.io/PXotv7zMTSOphZFg4f99iQ) or below:\n\n### What Happened\n\nThe runtime that is now deployed on Polkadot was prepared before the ParaId was obtained. During local testing rococo-local was used as the relay chain. The parachain was onboarded using another ParaId than the one within the runtime and the parachain was capable of producing blocks and functioning as expected. Assuming that everything is fine, the same runtime was used to bid in the parachain auction using a different ParaId than the one noted in the prepared runtime. As it turns out, the parachain is uncapable of producing blocks on Polkadot due to a ParaId mismatch.\n\nAbout the same time Zeitgeist also bid for a slot on Kusama to execute a slot lease swap. The testing procedure was the same and also resulted in success, however the chain was also uncapable of producing blocks. If those two events were temporaly further apart, the human error would only have happened once. Unfortunately we are forced into the highly aggrevating situation to ask the governance body twice to fix our Parachain, once for Kusama (proposal) and once for Polkadot.\n\n### Remedy\n\nTo fix the bricked chain, the chainspec used for Zeitgeist’s parachain on Polkadot must use 2092 within ParachainInfo::ParaId. To inform Polkadot about the new state root that results from the updated chainspec, paras.forceSetCurrentHead(2092, genesisHead) has to be invoked by the Root origin, whereas genesisHead is set to the resulting genesis state head that is derived from the new chainspec.\n\nWe also want to supply a new runtime. It is much more recent (polkadot-v0.9.29 instead of polkadot-v0.9.19).\n\n### Council Proposal\n\nWe are aware of the recent discussion around the technical council circumventing due process on governance here: [https://forum.polkadot.network/t/how-to-recover-a-parachain/673/23](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/how-to-recover-a-parachain/673/23) and withdrawing from fixing broken parachains. However there is currently not a best practice solution other then avoiding mistakes.\n\nOur humble request to the Technical Committee is to fast-rack this proposal, this is purely a technical hotfix to get the chain started the first time. \n\n### Proof of Authenticity\n\nTo proof that this request is authentic, the manager of ParaId 2092 does provide a signed statement of approval.\n\nManager (`registrar.paras(2092)`): `15Q7heNtPy5vaZ79c3eUt7M42Ao3okf7PKKdRDULBz3Z4UyF`\n\nStatement: [1675099734007] I hereby approve the deployment of the genesis state `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c2e17f26b505c2be4dcefd0ebfd3abe4536fcc86ded7329af33ddd0a9496db9a03170a2e7597b7b7e3d84c05391d139a62b157e78786d8c082f29dcf4c11131400` and the genesis wasm with the blake2-256 hash `0xa4fe96b65d8f78a7f92d1b7eb917ca501518b6910bee573565d16a911fb91a14` for ParaId 2092 on Polkadot\n\nSignature: `0x6a87523b11d4dd17411c3d9ebed91175dafed6b570014b164074b54b3b2c2b147574a9a5e3f2a25dfcd15340617c4df0730302f51016d5264257e7e8b0c39880`\n\n### \n\n**PLEASE NOTE THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBMITTED AS AN EXTERNAL MOTION: MEANING IF/AFTER COUNCIL APPROVAL, THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE THE FINAL DECISION ON THE PROPOSAL IN REFERENDA QUEUE.

See the release notes for more details.\n\n[Statemint Authorize Upgrade](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fstatemint-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x010239127c43fb7051d78dd91eb724b087607cb09bc046824b0d52e0a48981943e68)\n\n[Collectives Authorize Upgrade](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-collectives-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x0102de7616501046da7138c35e0b4699bf403a09523533f30e0e5180dbb5fb8fec4d) \n\n[Send from Polkadot](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x1a0008630001000100a10f0204060202286bee88010239127c43fb7051d78dd91eb724b087607cb09bc046824b0d52e0a48981943e68630001000100a50f0204060202286bee880102de7616501046da7138c35e0b4699bf403a09523533f30e0e5180dbb5fb8fec4d) \n\nProposal Hash: `0xa730cdb8c4b933b9e9ced277e63e79f0f52c0159f78bf60037f6ba312324051f`\n",

The upgraded parachain runtime introduced a couple of new pallets, the pallet-parachain-staking among them. This new pallet was responsible to assign new validators to session pallet and by extension the aura pallet. After the runtime upgrade, when a new session was triggered, it set the new authorities to an empty set since the pallet-parachain-staking was not set with any initial values.\n\nWe have explored all other solutions and after discussion and advice from Parity devs have created this proposal. Our humble request to the TC is to fastrack this proposal, this is purely a technical rollback since our chain has no user transactions or funds yet. We would like to distribute token rewards as soon as possible. Similar parachain resetshave been fastracked by the TC in the past and we request that our proposal be fastracked aswell.\n\nProposal hash: `0xfc0c33d0c0ae08d940fddadb11e239710da69b8660eaae7f77ea102a331e4ebe`\n\nPreimage is submitted. \n\n",

This will have several effects: **please read below!**\n\nFirst, any outstanding multisig calls (ones where one signatory has signed, but not the threshold) will not be able to execute.

      "content": "Seven of Polkadot’s leading projects have joined forces to establish standards and ethics for open-source development. The Polkadot Alliance was founded by Acala, Astar, Interlay, Kilt, Moonbeam, Phala, and Subscan, seven of the top projects occupying Polkadot’s parachain slots. The on-chain collective aims to support development standards and expose bad actors within the ecosystems of Polkadot. \n\nThe Polkadot Alliance is a ranked, on-chain collective. The ranks consist of \"Fellow” and \"Ally\" and will be discussed in more detail later. Although there is nothing in the protocol preventing an individual to join, the members of the Alliance are expected to be companies, projects, other collectives, or even other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. a company working on a parachain, or the Kusama network itself).\n\n\n## Founding Members:\n\nAcala - `12Nc2RuRfmZwNog7jCFzDK2D56HUfy9bYRr9dcFkpJnUwqpn`\n\nAstar - `1j5YyEGdcPd9BxkzVNNjKkqdi5f7g3Dd7JMgaGUhsMrZ6dZ`\n\nInterlay - `15Vd1mF4Uf4hVdS3q72t4y9fXxDZHLkQcHe77yEU4UQ7Jp3J`\n\nKILT - `143S55QzbrUYHkFcX6upPD6aJtsmXygLZTYVovpAkjPCMfNi`\n\nMoonbeam - `15o341YKi3FDX3fM1onp1bfLbjGcc13YNEFV6yQvSiCQaehi`\n\nPhala - `5D4ce5CWZwPrZzTptnHPYHmWEvc6sVBWEDgBnGvbwiGtuNQR`\n\nSubscan - `14RYaXRSqb9rPqMaAVp1UZW2czQ6dMNGMbvukwfifi6m8ZgZ`\n\n## Functions:\n\nThe Alliance performs three primary functions via its collective origin:\n\n1. Publication of a \"Rule\" which is this document;\n2. Management of its own membership, including promotion and removal;\n3. Curation of an \"Unscrupulous List\" containing URLs and accounts.\n\nProposal hash: `0x00c51905512990b7e0c8635f53de5548a5278e141944319eac99a49c1efd42c7` - please note this is an external motion, meaning if/after Council approves, the community will have the final decision. \n\nThe Charter of the Alliance, below:\n\n# Charter for a Polkadot Alliance\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe use of uncredited code and misuse of the Polkadot brand are a detriment to the ecosystem, and several Polkadot teams have come together to protect and enforce core standards for the ecosystem. The Polkadot Alliance provides an on-chain framework to recognize those teams who empower others and contribute to the ecosystem in alignment with open source culture and call attention to those that do not.\n\n## Background\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem has expanded, some low-quality teams have started to pollute the Polkadot brand. These teams copy code without attribution, use \"Polka\" branding with no intention of building on Polkadot, conduct scammy token raises on Ethereum, launch rival relay chains, and are disrespectful in their interactions with other community members.\n\nWithout a time-consuming investigation into a team's website, code, and whitepaper, it can be extremely difficult for someone to distinguish between good and bad actors.\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance provides a set of ethics and standards for the community to follow. Alliance membership indicates that the Polkadot community recognizes the team's positive contributions such as code, infrastructure, community building and education.\n\nThe Alliance also provides on-chain means to call out bad actors. Members are expected to dedicate time from one team member to help investigate breaches of the Alliance's standards.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance is a ranked, on-chain collective. The ranks consist of \"Fellow” and \"Ally\" and will be discussed in more detail later. Although there is nothing in the protocol preventing an individual to join, the members of the Alliance are expected to be companies, projects, other collectives, or even other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. a company working on a parachain, or the Kusama network itself).\n\nThe Alliance performs three primary functions via its collective origin:\n\n1. Publication of a \"Rule\" which is this document;\n2. Management of its own membership, including promotion and removal;\n3. Curation of an \"Unscrupulous List\" containing URLs and accounts.\n\nThe Alliance can also make announcements from its collective origin, however it is expected that these pertain to its primary functions.\n\nNote that the Alliance does not have any on-chain governance power. Its collective origin can only manage its own state, but its domain does not reach into other parts of the Polkadot protocol.\n\nNote that the Alliance acts as a collective without intention to form a company or other formal association or cooperation. The aims of the Alliance are defined herein and nothing in this document, other documents or the work of the Alliance, Fellows or Allies shall be interpreted as investment advice.\n\n### Rule\n\nThe collective maintains an IPFS content ID to a \"Rule\", which is this document and can be thought of as a charter or mandate of the Alliance. It includes all the rules for operation of the Alliance, including guidelines for how it evaluates accounts and websites for inclusion in the Unscrupulous List, how an account or website could be removed from the list, how to join the Alliance, who has voting rights, what actions constitute grounds for removal, etc.\n\n### Unscrupulous List\n\nThe Alliance, through a 60% majority of voting members, can add or remove websites and accounts to the Unscrupulous List.\n\nWebsites in the list may include:\n\n1. Those known for scamming users.\n2. Projects that have violated the standards expected within the Polkadot community.\n3. Projects that have shown a disregard of open source licenses.\n4. Projects that have used the \"Polka-\", \"Dot-\", \"Para-\", etc. branding with no real intention to contribute to Polkadot.\n\nAccounts in the list may include those associated with known scams.\n\n#### Intended Use\n\nThe Unscrupulous List may sound familiar to those who know of the [Polkadot JS Phishing](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing) registry, and is indeed meant for similar use. As the Alliance has no on-chain governance power, it cannot stop any user from interacting or transacting with an address in the list. However, it may be useful for wallets to warn users if they are attempting to connect to a listed website or send funds to a listed account.\n\n## Operation\n\n### Polkadot Parachain\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance lives on-chain in a pallet on **the Collectives parachain**, `ParaId = 1001`. All websites, applications, wallets, etc. that display Alliance membership should pull their information from the on-chain collective as the source of truth for membership. All Alliance members will need to be able to transact on this parachain from their account that is in the Alliance.\n\n### Initialization\n\nInitialization of the Alliance happens from the root origin on the Polkadot Relay Chain. Once the founding members are set, it will be up to them to use their voting rights to manage membership of the collective, namely:\n\n1. Deciding to promote someone from Ally to Fellow;\n1. Nominating someone as an Ally;\n1. Removing members who have violated the standards of the group.\n\n### Disbanding\n\nThe Alliance should represent all Polkadot stakeholders, not just the founding set of members. If the Polkadot network loses confidence in the Alliance, it may disband the Alliance via general referendum, clearing all members and requiring re-initialization.\n\n## Ranks\n\nThere are two ranks in the Alliance, from highest to lowest:\n\n**Fellow**\n\n**Definition:** Fellows are members whose candidacy is endorsed by other Fellows. Fellows can also be an Ally that was promoted to Fellow.\n\n_Note: A portion of the Fellows will be Founding Fellows, which are the teams who built the Polkadot Alliance and started to contribute before it was live on-chain._ \n\n**Rights:** Fellows have voting rights on Alliance motions. Being a Fellow includes a strong commitment not just to abide by the standards, but also to enforce these standards in a consistent and timely manner. Fellows have voting rights and carry out the primary goals and on-chain operation of the Alliance. They should also be available to investigate and mediate in a dispute between two Allies.\n\n**Ally**\n\n**Definition:** Allies are members of the Polkadot Alliance who, through active and sustained contributions to the ecosystem, have the opportunity to be promoted to Fellow.\n\n**Rights:** Being an Ally (and not being kicked) is a powerful indication of alignment with the ethical standards set by the Alliance, but Allies do not have voting rights until they are promoted to Fellow.\n\n### Joining\n\nOnce the Alliance has been initialized via referendum, there are two ways to join as an Ally. The first is by submitting a transaction to join and placing a deposit of 1,000 DOT, which is locked until retirement from the collective.The second is by nomination by a Fellow, which does not require a deposit.\n### Promotion\n\nThe majority of Alliance members will remain Allies. Being an Ally (and not being removed by vote) indicates that the Fellows agree that the Ally is acting in accordance with the ethics set forth by the Alliance.\n\nHowever, some members may wish to take a more active role in operating the Alliance and be promoted to Fellow. This happens through a motion amongst the voting members and requires 60% approval to pass.\n\n#### Criteria for Promotion\n\nFor promotion to Fellow, a team must have a significant positive impact on the whole Polkadot ecosystem. This is judged based on positive impact to the ecosystem in, but not limited to, the following ways:\n\n* **Common good code contribution:** Common good code should be some open source code that's used by a significant number of live projects. Code that's for demo purposes would be excluded, as it doesn't have real impact yet.\n* **Standard development:** Common standard accepted by a significant number of live projects. There are many PSPs, but most of them are not actually used by multiple live projects so those will be excluded.\n* **Awareness & Education Efforts:** This could include various forms of long-term contributions through marketing, content, and education efforts for the benefit of the broader Polkadot ecosystem, not just a single chain or product.\n* **Useful products:** Building useful products that drive growth, adoption, user experience, or any significant improvement to Polkadot will be considered a strong positive impact. For example, a wallet or block explorer that supports multiple relay/parachains and has a big user base will be strongly considered to have a big impact on the ecosystem and eligible for promotion. A smart contract project that integrates with multiple parachains and builds a strong user base could also be considered. A protocol that only lives on a single chain with low adoption has a small impact and less chance for promotion to Fellow.\n\n### Retirement\n\nMembers who wish to leave the Alliance can do so by signaling their intent to leave with 90 days notice. This \"retirement period\" is similar to the unbonding period used in staking, and is in place to give voting members time to replace the member leaving, or take action like removing the member and slashing their deposit if they have violated the standards of the Alliance.\n\nThis period is long, but we expect members to have long-term commitment to the Polkadot network. Unlike staking, a resignation would be a one-time event. The 90 day notice period is more like a typical resignation notice with an employer.\n\n### Forceful Removal\n\nMembers can be removed from the Alliance by a motion among voting members that requires 60% approval. Members who are forcefully removed will have their deposit slashed and sent to the Polkadot Treasury.\n\n## Membership\n\n### Benefits\n\nThe Alliance is not only to call out bad actors; being in the Alliance requires an investment of time and a high standard of behaviour. Members of the Alliance deserve recognition in the ecosystem, in applications, and in their own branding and marketing.\n\nThe Alliance has a number of [brand assets] (https://github.com/patractlabs/alliance-website/tree/master/packages/app/src/assets/imgs) available for use for its members.\n\n### Member Expectations\n\nFellows and Allies alike must show the Polkadot Alliance badge on their project website,  proof-of-membership or QR code (similar to Star Alliance, the airline alliance) to allow easy verification.\n\nVoting members (Fellows) must commit to evaluate claims of scams or misbehaviour and vote on motions in a timely manner.\n\nAll members commit to timely integration of the on-chain information with any of their systems where it would be relevant to display that information, as well as general off-chain best practices. This should include:\n\n* Displaying correct identicons for addresses\n* Utilizing the finality system (as opposed to arbitrary \"confirmation depth\")\n* Displaying short-form index SS58 or accounts’ names where possible\n* Displaying identity attestation information\n* Displaying Polkadot Alliance status of addresses\n* Displaying status of addresses and websites that have been deemed unscrupulous.\n\nThe Alliance should uphold the following rules of membership, and apply them to all the teams, addresses, and websites that they evaluate:\n\n#### Minimum Contribution Requirements & Relegation\n\nSee “Criteria for Promotion” above for general guidance on how a strong contribution to the Polkadot ecosystem is defined. For Fellows to remain in their position, the project must meet these criteria at least every month, or could be subject to relegation to Ally.\n\n#### Respect for Others\n\n1. A warm and welcoming community is key to attracting new members and maintaining existing ones, which helps build up expertise and talent. Open and rational criticism is key to the enlightened evolution of ideas and must be welcomed. However, it must always be taken into account that the Polkadot community is comprised of diverse cultures, experiences and perspectives, so interaction must at all times be based on mutual respect, decency and consideration. Members and representatives of Alliance teams shall respect the Polkadot Community Principles at all times. Repeated infractions may result in the suspension of the team. Teams/projects should encourage their own community members to follow the Polkadot Code of Conduct and manage members of their community who are in violation.\n\n#### Respect of Intellectual Property\n\n1. **Open-Source technology builds a brilliant network.** Technical communities grow and success happens through network effects. Successful members attract users to their platform and to underlying platforms in order to drive growth for other members. Network effects happen on many levels, but often center around the need for shared formats, protocols, interfaces, and their underlying code. Open source and open engineering in general help drive these network effects, and in the case of Alliance members, help Polkadot become a successful platform. Alliance members commit to ensure all code, formats, and protocols used are made open to the maximum degree possible given their business constraints. Alliance members are not required to open all of their technology, but are expected to take a pragmatic approach when deciding to do so. Egregious, persistent, and unreasonable refusal to open parts of technology when to do so could not reasonably be expected to affect the team’s value proposition, but does clearly harm the overall Polkadot technical community may result in a warning and, if unchecked, suspension from the Alliance.\n\n2. **Unattributed code reuse threatens code creativity.** Respectful attribution is a cornerstone of a strong technical open source community. A credible expectation that attribution will be given provides an incentive for open-engineering and the sharing of technical labor. Communities suffer and break when work is misattributed. The Polkadot technical community is no different: open source licenses must be respected at all times and minor infractions of this (what could reasonably be considered to be accidental) should be dealt with a warning to the team. Larger infractions (e.g. where code was copied in bulk and the license was clearly stated and ignored), repeated minor infractions, or a refusal to correct an infraction may result in suspension from the Alliance.\n\n3. **Branding builds a strong community.** The ability to create and advertise a product under a clear brand is a cornerstone of modern communication. Brands reduce confusion within an ecosystem and beyond by creating clear, meaningful labels to distinguish between teams and products. Trademarks help facilitate this by providing a level of formal legal protection but they are difficult, time-consuming, and costly to enforce. Disrespect of branding and trademarks within the ecosystem leads to confusion of the ecosystem’s user base, resulting in a weaker platform. The trademarks of Alliance teams shall be respected at all times and a clear, unauthorized breach shall result in suspension from the Alliance. The unauthorized use of team or product branding which could reasonably be considered to be derivative from another Alliance team shall firstly be warned and, if unchecked in a timely and reasonable manner, secondly result in a suspension from the Alliance.\n\n#### Respect of the Polkadot Brand\n\n1. **The community has unity around the Relay Chain.** Polkadot was not designed to be a lonely chain and the Alliance very much respects the prospect of a rich environment of many chains each going in their own technical direction in order to optimize for their own use case. So, where there are external networks that deliver key features, use cases, or user-access that Polkadot does not or cannot address, then Alliance members should be encouraged to work together with these networks, building bridges and collaborating in enlightened self-interest for mutual benefit. However, alternative Polkadot-like relay chains which provide essentially equivalent functionality to, or even aim to supplant the Polkadot mainnet provide distraction and fragmentation, and in the long-run could hurt Polkadot’s security, technology, and social integrity. Alternative relay chains deriving significantly or entirely from the Polkadot technology base, in terms of design, protocol, or code should be judged by the principle of the minimum number of relay chains, and prevented from becoming members of the Alliance. Alliance teams should not support or work with these networks. Exemptions are made should the Alliance determine that the network in question provides a greater overall value to Polkadot than the cost of network fragmentation. The complete list of exemptions has only one member — Kusama — as it provides a value-bearing testbed for Polkadot technology and clearly addresses a lower-security, lower-reliability usage proposition.\n\n2. **Polka-/Dot- branding only for Polkadot projects.** In the interests of minimizing confusion and retaining a coherent community brand, products branded to give the appearance of being Polkadot-based should be legitimately linked to the Polkadot technology base. Blockchain-based products whose names contain the “Parachain”, Polka\", or “Dot” word fragments, or which clearly derive their overall brand from the Polkadot style guide, must have a credible plan to become a parachain on Polkadot or an affiliate network. Teams who host an invalidly labeled product may not be Alliance members and Alliance members should not collaborate with teams who do host such products.\n\n3. **Commitment to scam prevention.** It is important for a community to take reasonable precautions to protect their members from serious abuses of trust. While there are some reasonably legitimate projects with weak or no safeguards on their contributions, the reality is that most of such projects promised much and delivered little. Large-scale pre-release crowdfunding on alternative platforms should be investigated by Alliance members and should be up for discussion if the project belongs to an Alliance member. Alliance members may take into account whatever factors they want when considering approval, including the team’s reasons for crowdfunding, the platform on which they are crowdfunding (Polkadot-based platform may be considered a more reasonable choice), the oversight and governance safeguards given to participants, and the team’s demonstrated ability to deliver on the promises they make. All in all, Alliance members should collaborate with any initiatives aiming to protect community members from scam activities.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance is a ranked, on-chain collective of teams with a track record of delivering valuable contributions to the network and who have a long-term alignment with developing a welcoming, innovative Polkadot network. The members set and uphold a set of ethics and standards for others to model in the ecosystem. They also evaluate teams in an effort to provide information and opinions that will protect users from scams and ill-meaning projects.\n\n## Appendix\n\nHeavily based off of [this original document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXlVDDQj6v8kOTvbMXBmenBZ3Sfn5zZf0ipQbYvdipo/edit#). \n\nGenesis of the Collectives parachain includes the v0.9.29 Alliance pallet: [https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/polkadot-v0.9.29/frame/alliance](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/polkadot-v0.9.29/frame/alliance)  \n\nThe genesis head and runtime can be found in the special release: [https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-collectives-v9290](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-collectives-v9290)",

      "content": "This proposal aims to cancel the upgrade of Polkadot Runtime to v9320, due to a change on FRAME code explained below:\n\nAs the dev team works on transforming all FRAME pallets and code to work properly with WeightsV2, they have added the following check to the scheduler pallet: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs#L1105-L1107](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs#L1105-L1107)\n\nThis piece of code should ensure that we don't execute a scheduled call that would use more weight than we have left for the block. For most calls this isn't any problem as they should be fit easily into a block. However, for `set_code` the dev team currently has annotated it with using the max block weight: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 ](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 )\n\nSo, when trying to execute `set_code` with the scheduler it will always fail this check. There will be already some consumed weight when trying to dispatch the call and `some_weight + max_block_weight` will always be bigger than `max_block_weight`. A new proposal will be submitted with the correct call soon.\n\n\n - Proposal hash: `0x88998cf7535c1f22d62849be8464fdc38fe46c0a46dc943ec56c91ef6592ec65`\n\n - Preimage is submitted. \n\n- Note this motion is an external one: meaning if/after Council approves, the community will vote on this proposal with the final decision.",

      "content": "This proposal will fail in enactment, so [external motion 306](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/306) is now opened to cancel this. A change on FRAME code explained below is the reason this will fail: as the dev team works on transforming all FRAME pallets and code to work properly with WeightsV2, they have added the following check to the scheduler pallet: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs#L1105-L1107](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs#L1105-L1107)\n\nThis piece of code should ensure that we don't execute a scheduled call that would use more weight than we have left for the block. For most calls this isn't any problem as they should be fit easily into a block. However, for `set_code` the dev team currently has annotated it with using the max block weight: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 ](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 )\n\nSo, when trying to execute `set_code` with the scheduler it will always fail this check. There will be already some consumed weight when trying to dispatch the call and `some_weight + max_block_weight` will always be bigger than `max_block_weight`. A new proposal will be submitted with the correct call soon.\n\nPlease note this proposal should be rejected.\n\n______________________\n_______________________\n_______________________\n\nThe proposal aims to upgrade Polkadot’s runtime to [v9320](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.32): more information can be found on the release notes.\n\n\n**Runtime**\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12358](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12358) Low - Remove contracts rpcs\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12421](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12421) Low - Adapt `pallet-contracts` to weightv2\n- [S] ✅ audited [#11649](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11649) Low - Bound uses of `call`\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12429](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12429) Low - Contracts: adapt dry-run runtime apis to weightv2\n- [S] ⏳ pending non-critical audit [#12282](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12282) Low - Maximum value for `multiplierupdate`\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6021](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6021) Low - Maximum value for multiplierupdate\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12334](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12334) Low - Macro stubs for all pallet:: macros to improve documentation visibility and discovery + revamp of pallet macro documentation\n- [S] ✅ audited [#12109](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12109) Low - Vesting pallet - make `withdrawreasons` configurable\n- [P] ✅ audited [#5451](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5451) Low - Manual para lock\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6155](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6155) Low - Add `force_open_hrmp_channel` call\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6171](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6171) Low - Bump transaction_version (0.9.31)\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12558](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12558) Low - Update `pallet-multisig` benches\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6189](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6189) Low - Update weights, attempt two (0.9.31)\n\nThis release also contains the changes **from v0.9.31 to v0.9.32**:\n- [Substrate#12630](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12630): Make `--database` cli argument case insensitive again.\n- [Substrate#12632:](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12632): Fixes a bug with the transaction pool after doing a warp sync.\n- [Substrate#12633](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12633): Fixes the `payment_queryInfo` RPC to be compatible with the latest runtime changes.\n\n\nProposal hash: `0xbd78d3542767047aba0babb8c8825a5799e3ef54a21193ffe24b98eb4f895162`\n\nYou can review the hash and changes in the release notes and use SRTool to verify proposal hash - make sure to vote at your convenience!

This creates a nomination market, where in every era, the top 22\\_500 nominators from this open market are chosen to participate in the election process, and possibly receive staking rewards (if other conditions like over-subscription are not met).\n\nThis is a complicated and involved process. Nomination pools are exactly here to combat this and provide a simpler experience for DOT-holders to participate in staking.\n\nBased on this, let’s cluster Polkadot nominators into two groups: **active** (in the top 22500), and **waiting**. The main concern at this point is to\n\n-   Encourage all existing waiting nominators to join pools. This is mainly a task for the Wallet/UI development ecosystem, and is beyond the scope of this discussion.\n-   Prevent too many waiting nominators to be created. The reason being that I speculate that most of these nominators have **erroneously** in the waiting queue, and prefer joining pools instead.\n\nTo achieve the second goal, we can set the nomination limits (10 DOTs, 50\\_000) such that the system is not so _inviting_ to waiting nominators. In other words, the system should try and prevent nominators from being created, if they are certainly going to end up being in the waiting queue.\n\nFor example, we empirically know that the actual amount of DOTs needed to be an active nominator is around 200 DOTs as of this writing. Therefore, we can set the minimum nomination limit to a higher value such as 100.\n\nNote that keeping a buffer of waiting nominators is a positive factor for Polkadot's economic security. It allows for buffer of waiting nominators to be ready, should a (malicious) cluster of nominators decide to chill all at once, preventing nothing at stake issues. Therefore, I am not suggesting lowering 50\\_000 as well, and find that a reasonable bound. But, with nomination pools, I do think we should immediately forward anyone with less than e.g. 50 DOTs to join pools instead, and the way to do that is to immediately reject their nominate transaction.\n\n-   [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1224](../post/1224)",

      "title": "Polkadot Collectives Common Good Parachain Proposal",
      "content": "As outlined in a [recent blog post](https://polkadot.network/blog/proposal-for-common-good-parachains/), this discussion is about a proposal to add a new common good parachain to Polkadot focused on collectives. The first collective to form will likely be the [Polkadot Alliance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXlVDDQj6v8kOTvbMXBmenBZ3Sfn5zZf0ipQbYvdipo/edit#), but this parachain will also support other collectives that are in service of the Polkadot network.\n\nThere are no plans for a Kusama counterpart to the Polkadot Collectives parachain. In fact, the Kusama network itself may join several collectives to exercise its voice within the Polkadot ecosystem. For example, the Kusama network could join the Polkadot Alliance to set the standards for Polkadot brand use.\n\nOther collectives do not warrant two distinct groups, like the [Technical Fellowship](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/calling-polkadot-core-developers/506). This group of technical experts who have made core protocol contributions to the network, would have nearly identical member sets, as the developers most intimatly familiar with Polkadot's inner workings deploy most of their code on Kusama as a step toward Polkadot.\n\nI intend to submit this proposal to the Council to register and onboard the Collectives parachain with a four-year lease, and posting here first to open discussion.\n\nThe full launch will include a series of referenda on Polkadot for approval by the entire stakeholder body. These will be roughly as follows:\n\n1. This proposal, to register the parachain and set the lease period. Once on board, it should start producing blocks. However, since it is not a trusted teleporter from the Relay Chain's point of view, nobody will be able to transact on it as there won't be any DOT with which to pay fees.\n1. Runtime upgrade to the Relay Chain to include Collectives as a trusted teleporter.\n\nFinally, I would expect a referendum to initiate the Alliance, which could come before or after the Relay Chain's recognition of the parachain as a teleporter. However, this is outside the scope of this discussion; I expect the Alliance founders to propose how they would like to launch.\n\nThe call details will be finalized when Parity publishes the [Collectives genesis release](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-collectives-v9290) and the Technical Committee indicates a rough enactment timeframe, which is needed to set the first period of the lease. The call will be a batch with `registrar.force_register` and `slots.force_lease` and the appropriate parameters.\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: Including call info.\n\nCall hash: `0x9ef867bcaaee9750487738c6e6537eb52a3047c7bb2f06eb30dc05073dae90d5`\n\nFor some reason Polkassembly won't allow me to add the entire Polkadot JS link for the call (guessing it is too large), but it is as follows:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DDU8FPX.png)",

      "content": "Polkadot community, the time has finally come:\n\nNomination pools can go live any time now in Polkadot. This is a great milestone, removing any barrier for native relay chain staking for DOT-holders. This proposal suggests the following configuration for nomination pools on Polkadot, following Kian's advice from the staking team:\n\n**1 DOT to join a pool.** \"I actually used to suggest 5 DOTs for a slightly higher sybil resistance, but I think the 5x factor here is not that big of a difference, and allowing staker holders to join pools with at little as 1 DOT is a nice milestone. Moreover, this sybil attack is not really viable as we can easily lift the limit on maximum members (mentioned below) and then it would have no effect.\"\n\n**200 DOTs to create a pool.** \"This is not a cost or deposit. It is actually the initial collateral/stake of the pool, and by setting it to 200, it will ensure that all pools have an initial stake that’s more than the minimum that’s needed to earn rewards (~170 as of now). This initial stake still earns rewards for the creator of the pool, and can be unstaked once the pool is being dissolved.\"\n\n**Maximum of 64 pools and 16k members in all pools**. \"These are only there so that if there is a bug, we can easily migrate the data and perform a fix. If we reach these limits, they can trivially be lifted to a higher value. Moreover, if pools work fine for e.g. ~6 months, we can proceed with lifting them altogether.\"\n\n\"I have worked hard on communicating that: “Pools are designed to be infinitely scalable”, I am suggesting these limits only out of extra caution.\"\n\nThis initial configuration composition, aiming to be presented for a vote if the community agrees, can be found [HERE](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x270a0100e40b540200000000000000000000000100204aa9d101000000000000000000000140000000010040000000). Preimage is submitted. Please note this is an external motion needing root origin: after Council approval, the community will vote to approve or reject this proposal in referenda queue. ",

      "content": "Please note this motion replaces [motion 256](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/256) due to an error on the proposal weight and [motion 257](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/257) due to an error downgrading the call from the relay chain to native: the proposal fixes both mistakes.\n\nFive more parachains have requested an HRMP channel with Statemint. This motion accepts them all and opens return channels.\n\n**Handy Info**\n\n- **Treasury Address**: `13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB`\n- **Treasury AccountId:** `0x6d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n- **Statemint Address:** `13YMK2edbuhwMBxeUWm9c643A2wyYHwSVh1bCM7tShtg7Dtk`\n- **Statemint AccountId:** `0x70617261e8030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n\n- **Parachains that aim to open channels**: 2021, 2031, 2032, 2035, 2046.\n\n**Call Construction**\n\nThese are constructed backwards. That is, the call to use as the proposal is at the end.\n\n**Relay Chain Call to Execute**\n\nFirst, we need the call that Statemint will execute on the Relay Chain. This accepts all channel requests and returns channel requests to the initiators.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Polkadot): \n\n```\n0x1a02283c01e50700003c01ef0700003c01f00700003c01f30700003c01fe0700003c00e5070000e8030000009001003c00ef070000e8030000009001003c00f0070000e8030000009001003c00f3070000e8030000009001003c00fe070000e803000000900100\n```\n\n**Message from Statemint**\n\nThe above message needs to come from Statemint. So we put it into an XCM (the “Transact” instruction) along with purchasing some execution capacity and returning any leftover fees to the Treasury.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Statemint): \n\n```\n0x1f0001010002140004000000000700c817a80413000000000700c817a80400060002286bee9d011a02283c01e50700003c01ef0700003c01f00700003c01f30700003c01fe0700003c00e5070000e8030000009001003c00ef070000e8030000009001003c00f0070000e8030000009001003c00f3070000e8030000009001003c00fe070000e803000000900100140d01010000000004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\n**Proposal on the Relay Chain**\n\nBut, governance is on the Relay Chain, not Statemint. So take some DOT from the Treasury (100 DOT for 10 channels at 10 DOT each plus 2 DOT for fees) and send a message to Statemint telling it to send a message back. This is the proposal to vote on.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Polkadot): \n\n``` \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\n```\n\n- Call Hash: `0xfa5da8a4d9ef08dd22dfbc189861cbb9275dc8c52e4ce9b04f21cc830b3d5617`\n\nPreimage has already been submitted for verification by the community as well. After/if Council votes and passes this proposal, this will need to be voted by the community in referenda queue. ",

For Statemine only, this release also allows the use of sufficient assets to pay [XCM fees](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/1278). This feature will run on Statemine before making its way to Statemint; Statemint does not have any assets deemed sufficient yet, so not having it there will not affect current interactions.",

It also allows NFT collection owners to set a [max number of items](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11441). Finally, this release updates the deposits required to create both fungible and non-fungible asset classes to 10 DOT.",

On the runtime side, this release includes, among others, child bounties, and a PR enabling migration of slot depositors in crowdloan migration for parachains to be able to swap slots, among other things. \n\nFeel free to use srtool yourself to check the proposal hash. If passed by the Council, this proposal should be voted by the community and enacted after. Make sure to vote at your convenience!\n\n## Statemint\n\nStatemint v900 ([release notes](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v9.0.0)) marks the true launch of Statemint and its functionality. With audits having been complete for several months, the only thing Statemint needed was a way to get DOT from the Polkadot Relay onto Statemint. With the enabling of disputes and XCM on the Relay Chain as of v9190, this is now possible. The v900 release allows users of Statemint to teleport DOT from the Relay Chain, teleport it back, open HRMP channels, and perform all asset/NFT operations without restrictions.\n\nThis Statemint release also includes some minor Uniques pallet improvements in preparation for XCM V3, which will allow users and applications to use NFTs over XCM.\n\n## Call\n\n![preimage](https://i.imgur.com/UdvUEmX.png)\n\n![statemint auth](https://i.imgur.com/Wcmmg8m.png)",

      "content": "TL;DR. Phala parachain is bricked. The team is requesting a Motion to fast-track a `Paras.forceSetCurrentCode` call to unbrick the parachain.\n_______________\nPhala Network (id: 2035) became a parachain recently. However, during the progressive launching process, the team noticed that there's no way to upgrade the runtime due to the misconfiguration in the genesis runtime. Specifically, the genesis runtime has both sudo and democracy disabled. Without the help from the relaychain side, the parachain will be \"bricked\" forever -- all the functions need to be enabled by runtime upgrades which is infeasible due to the problem.\n\nProposal hash: `0x7af427aa7665a073ca61b83c04791f185d9170ea2e49a8a7be323650cea8b75f`\n\nMore info on the misconfiguration of the runtime, force runtime update on relay chain and team's roadmap can be found in the discussion link: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1005](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1005).

      "title": "Polkadot Proposal: Lowering Nomination Intention Limits",
      "content": "This proposal is explained as suggested by Kian from the Staking team.\n\n**NOTE**: this proposal is using the new terminology introduced in [the February newsletters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bisngPfte-P2vMuP_JrV6fIpNnd04uCWrqt4UbFklF8/edit#heading=h.kdyyexvr13fu), please refer to that for a recap.\n\nThis proposal aims to alter the limits on the nomination intention for Polkadot, namely lowering them since they are not strictly needed anymore.\n\nAs of release of runtime 9170, pallet-bags-list has been [fully enabled in Polkadot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bisngPfte-P2vMuP_JrV6fIpNnd04uCWrqt4UbFklF8/edit#heading=h.z30dvegsxvsi), and setting the intention to nominate should now be made possible for a larger audience. In essence, the number of intentions need no longer be bounded by 22,500. The bags-list will take care of picking up the top 22,500 nominations (those who become “electing”). Thus, we propose the following:\n\n1. Increase the number of possible intentions to **50,000**. \n\n**NOTE**: that this number could be lifted altogether, but we suggest keeping an upper bound that’s dynamically controlled by the governance as an extra safety measure, at least for the time being.\n\n2. Decrease the amount of stake needed to submit a nomination intention to **10 DOT**.\n\n**NOTE**: Similarly, this number could also be lowered back to 1 DOTs, which is the existential deposit, but we suggest doing that as a next step within the next few months, and for now keep this small limit to prevent a massive sudden influx of intentions. \n\nCall design:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RczyGyY/Screenshot-2022-03-09-at-09-57-10.png)\n\nEncoded call data: `0x071700e87648170000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000150c3000001b0040000015a00000000`\n\n**Urgency**: Ideally, this proposal should be enacted before the number of total nominators in Polkadot reaches 22,500 (the value for which at the time of this writing is 21,214). If it does, the ‘nominate’ transaction will become unavailable to all stakers. This proposal should have no negative effect on any stakers, as it will only relax the limits to submit for nomination intentions.\n\nLink to discussion post: [HERE](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/921).

      "content": "Please note this is a `batch` call proposal, combining the Polkadot upgrade with the Statemint upgrade: \n\n- Batch call hash: `0xbf60cbdd406036e0b6a3028763bfe20d9569780c0ffddc75cf209358fce3111c`\n- Call design: [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1emtVtvZ-4skQnKDJj5r0_fP1bm-q4l4l/view?usp=sharing).\n\nThe **Polkadot runtime** will be upgraded to **v9170** - Release notes, runtime changes and proposal hash can be found [HERE](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.17-rc4). This release improves the block time degradation issues, as seen [on Kusama](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4911). It also includes new changes in the runtime: like optimised weights and contains the PR to fully enable the bags list on polkadot, which **removes the need of having a strict maximum count for nominators** and also fully alleviates the phantom nominator issue. Both of these are explained further [in the January issue of \"Polkadot Staking Progress”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MPnxGzoiRcJJYAGOYVU8dGUkqybuhoQX7wg5ouGfgU/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Call hash for polkadot upgrade: `0x8eb2806cbdf1a4ba91334669b2476870134db3af5c77f418152af0ad354d3b32`\n \nThe **Statemint runtime** will be upgraded to [v700](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v7.0.0-rc8):\n\n-  The Uniques pallet includes an [extra storage item](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9940) linking class owners to their NFT classes. This storage map comes in handy for UI developers, especially around the UX of creating and minting NFTs.\n\n- With the inclusion of [Polkadot 4470](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/4470) and [Cumulus 831](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/831), parachains that have HRMP channels with Statemint will finally be able to use them in both directions. For parachain developers, note that this is a breaking change and if you've used reserve backed transfers from Statemint then you will need to migrate some storage items.\n\n- It addresses all issues found by independent auditors regarding the Statemint runtimes. For Statemint, this means that once teleportation is ready (pending some final disputes related features) it should be OK to lift the call filter restricting asset/unique creation, opening the door for fungible and non-fungible assets in the Polkadot network.\n\nAs usual, the Statemint proposal will dispatch an `authorizeUpgrade` message. All info about the upgrade can be found on the link above.\n\n- Hash for XCM call (council motion) can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvnGFDK2KVjvFNMxs6qA9evkeSyniOdS/view?usp=sharing).\n- Hash: `0x8adb4ccdf996f05fa7941ce3b56ecec6dd49a88d9db445963e813ac10cadd326`.\n- Encoded call: `0x01028adb4ccdf996f05fa7941ce3b56ecec6dd49a88d9db445963e813ac10cadd326`\n- Runtime release can be found [HERE](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v7.0.0-rc8).\n\nFeel free to use srtool yourself to check the proposal hash. If passed by the Council, this proposal should be voted by the community and enacted after. Make sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "This is a short term upgrade proposed to increase the limit of DOTs for nomination from 120 DOTs to 160, maintaining the increase of 40 DOTs that the network has had throughout this period of updating the nominator limit through governance. The reason for this is the combination of the following:\n\n- Polkadot’s [0.9.16](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.16) upgrade was scheduled to contain a fix that would completely remove the 120 DOTs limit. This explained thoroughly in the monthly staking report of [January 2022](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376#january-2022). After the 0.9.16 update, the nomination limit would move to a dynamic system based on demand, rather than a fixed entry barrier.  \n- Due to some unforeseen issues arisen after the deployment of 0.9.16 in Kusama, 0/9.16  has not yet been proposed to Polkadot.\n- In the meantime, the number of nominators in Polkadot has been increased to reach the 22500 limit. \n\nAs a consequence, we propose to temporarily increase the nomination limit to **160** DOTs. This allows for the permissionless `chill_other` transaction to be used and prune the number of nominators, in order to keep the nomination ecosystem of Polkadot active, whilst we wait for the enactment of runtime 0.9.16 on Polkadot.\n\n Proposal details: All values are unchanged except for `minNominatorBond`.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/vz2vcdj/Screenshot-2022-02-21-at-18-31-17.png)\n\n- Call hash: `0xb2286cbfdd18c265572d3305754b0dbe8ba1fd8da40ef48ff0d5ef40912f2291`\n\n- Call data: `0x0717a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e457000001b0040000015a`\n\nPreimage is submitted.

      "content": "After Shell successfully processed the runtime upgrade to Statemint and handed over block production to the Statemint collators, they were not able to produce blocks due to a mismatch in key types. Specifically, Aura uses sr25519 keys to sign blocks, but the keys in the genesis chain spec were generated using ed25519.\n\nA new runtime was created as a temporary fix. This runtime enables ed25519 in Aura for Statemint. This will be enacted on the Relay Chain so that validators will be able to validate the collator signatures. After the chain is producing blocks again, a follow up runtime upgrade will migrate Aura back to using sr25519 keys.\n\nCall hash: `0x0e21b5233c7591ee89eca0cae71cf9a9a4c45fe2393075ab33361a673f5d322d`\n\nPreimage:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/pUVsJGR.png)",

The second will authorize the upgrade to Statemint. Both calls need to be constructed on Shell and then dispatched from the Relay Chain in an XCM.\n\nSee the [release notes](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/statemint-v6.0.1) to review the assets, reproduce the `set_storage` call, and generate the runtime.\n\n## Shell Constructions\n\n### Set Storage\n\nThe `set_storage` call can be generated with the `build-spec` command from a collator node, using `statemint_genesis.json` as input.

Authorize Upgrade\n\nThis message authorizes the upgrade of Shell to a runtime with a given hash (statemint_runtime-v601.compact.compressed.wasm). Once the upgrade is authorized, anyone can submit the runtime via `parachain_system.enact_authorized_upgrade`, and it will upgrade 600 blocks (approximately 1 hour) later.\n\nCall data: `0x0103af49687b93d91fc08c1fcea1001d724a95c533a949019645d3e4179beedbf67e`\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rHrTJRx.png)\n\n## Polkadot Proposal\n\nThis proposal is to schedule these messages to dispatch from Polkadot to Shell. They will dispatch 5 and 20 blocks after enactment to ensure each is processed separately. We give them plenty of weight (100 billion and 1 billion, respectively) to ensure they execute.\n\nCall hash: `0xa6830793b6a3473f66fbd7305a9e330dd2dd688df0e8fcbd0c9ff08d28040a34`\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5D8syF9.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YmVC8o3.png)\n",

      "content": "Proposal for First Parachain Auctions on Polkadot\n\nThis is a proposal to schedule the first set of parachain auctions on Polkadot as well as get\nCouncil buy-in to a recommended strategy for scheduling auctions on a 3-6 month basis.\n\nBased on the performance of parachains on Kusama and the state of audits, the Parity engineering\nteam believes that the code for parachains, auctions, and crowdloans is ready for an initial\nproduction release.\n\nThis motion proposes two batches of auctions:\n\n- The first: five auctions, starting 11 Nov, seven days each, beginning every _seven_ days, for\n  lease periods 6-13 (LP6 is slated to begin 15 Dec)\n- The second: six auctions, starting 23 Dec, seven days each, beginning every _14_ days, for\n  lease periods 7-14 (LP7 is slated to begin 09 Mar 2022)\n\nAs auctions can take place prior to a lease period starting, this motion schedules auctions to\nbegin around mid-day (UTC) of 11 November.\n\nIn order to ensure stability guarantees, I suggest along with this proposal that the Council and\nnetwork governance limit the number of parachain slots on Polkadot to 75% of that on Kusama. This\ninitial schedule will last until early March; as the network grows the Council can suggest an\nupdated auction cadence to stay within a reasonable factor of safety relative to the number of\nparachains on Kusama.\n",

      "title": "Increasing nominators’ min bond on Polkadot",
      "content": "The staking team requested a new proposal to increase the minimum bond and allow new nominators above the threshold to participate in the network’s security mechanism. As mentioned by the Staking team on [this message](https://matrix.to/#/!FdCojkeGzZLSEoiecf:web3.foundation/$YNsqfhHKXoRbW_QKvtG5EKn8HodUGFts6abJJdSAoVA?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), Polkadot currently has 22500 nominators and the configuration of the staking system prevents further nominators to join.\n\nThe team suggests to update the staking parameters: The proposal has the goal to increase the minimum bond to allow new nominators above the threshold to participate in the network’s security mechanism, and for less staked nominators to be chilled. **Note that after the latest runtime upgrade (9090), existing nominators can always update their preference at all conditions.**\n\nThe proposal the team suggested aims to change the staking parameters to allow more nominators with higher backing stake be able to join the staking system. The existing parameters as follows:\n\n- Minimum validator bond: None\n- Maximum validator count: `1200`\n- Minimum nominator bond: `80` DOT\n- Maximum nominator count: `22500`\n- Chill threshold: 90%\n\nThe new proposed parameters aim to update one value:\n\n- New minimum nominator bond: `120` DOTs\n\nThe team aims to increase the limit enough so that we won't need to do another tweak for at least a month. **Multiple tracks of optimization are ongoing by the development team**, and you can read more about them on this [issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9511). Furthermore, a monthly progress report will be released [here](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376) to communicate the technical details. Please note that increasing the value of the parameter to **120 DOTs** will hopefully give the team another more time until the new threshold is reached and we have made progress on a more permanent solution. Please leave your comments and feedback on the proposal. Keep in mind these measure is **temporary**, and the overall goal is the stability and security of the network.\n\n- Preimage [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FRH_Hzs8kqwI_lfMZhC6bu6Dt0bQdCf/view?usp=sharing) - submitted.\n- Hash: `0xb862a50c4e8541c013637e9766f3059af75218f0f9630dc8b6c85dc8f633a971`\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

That means if the network has 4500 empty slots, they will be filled in 30 days. The team aims to increase the limit enough so that we won't need to do another tweak for at least a month. Changing this parameter to `80` will almost expose 4500 nominators. \n\nThe new chill-threshold will ensure that the permissionless `chill_other` can only be used when more than 90% of \"maximum nominator count\" is used.\nnote that to ensure polkadot's stability until the parachains launch, this motion does not yet include an increase in the total count of nominators. Multiple tracks of optimization are ongoing by the development team, and you can read more about them in this [issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9511).\n\nPlease note that doubling the value of the parameter to `80` DOTs will hopefully give the team more time until the new threshold is reached and we have made progress on a more permanent solution.

      "content": "The proposal will upgrade the nomination limits such that more people can start nominating. Note that this is a time-sensitive action, because currently existing nominators cannot change their intentions. [This pull request](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9193) will change this logic, so that those who are already a nominator will not be affected by any limit, and **will be placed in the next Polkadot  runtime upgrade**.\n\nThe new limits increase the nominator capacity by `2500` (making it `22500` in total), and increase the the stake threshold to `40DOTs`. It is intended that these numbers would keep the current count of nominators (all of whom must have 40 or more DOTs) below the new count limit (`22500`) **until the next runtime upgrade**: If an influx of nominators is observed over a very short period of time, the stake limit might need to be increased again proportionally to keep the staking system stable.\n\nPreimage [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pp8mkUkFCkYiauUAe2RXFBhzk5wgulGV/view?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

      "title": "Limit on the maximum number of validators, based on scaling issues",
      "content": "The proposal **sets a limit on the maximum number of validators**, namely `1200`, and leaves the rest of the parameters unchanged (`20000`/`20DOTs`) for nominators. This proposal started as an **external motion**, meaning that if the Council passes this, the community needs to vote in referenda queue to be executed. \n\nThe validator community should be aware that the discussion around minimum DOT stake limit for validators (similar to what was imposed recently on nominators) has already begun [on the Polkadot Direction channel](https://matrix.to/#/!OwgojQyBzTlUQGGLhq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), and will be proposed **as soon as discussion reaches consensus**. Similar to the nominator limits, **these limits are for the safety of the network and will grow as the network grows.**\n\nThe preimage of this proposal can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8J1zSPobzNMSAoAWaSeTWvLRI7QdmwH/view?usp=sharing). \n\nContext on why this is needed and an explanation of the scaling issues we are seeing on Polkadot Network can be found on the [last runtime upgrade post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/88).\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

This proposal started as an **external motion**, meaning that if the Council passes this, the community needs to vote in referenda queue to be executed. \n\nThe validator community should be aware that the discussion around minimum DOT stake limit for validators (similar to what was imposed recently on nominators) has already begun [on the Polkadot Direction channel](https://matrix.to/#/!OwgojQyBzTlUQGGLhq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), and will be proposed **as soon as discussion reaches consensus**. Similar to the nominator limits, **these limits are for the safety of the network and will grow as the network grows.**\n\nThe preimage of this proposal can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8J1zSPobzNMSAoAWaSeTWvLRI7QdmwH/view?usp=sharing). \n\nContext on why this is needed and an explanation of the scaling issues we are seeing on Polkadot Network can be found on the [last runtime upgrade post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/88).\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",
