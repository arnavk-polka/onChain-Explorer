      "content": "The 3rd Annual Business of Blockchain Technology Conference (May 29-31, 2025\\) at the University of Miami’s Patti and Allan Herbert Business School utilized Polkadot’s $15,000 presenting partnership and $10,000 travel budget from the Events Bounty but did not cover any compensation for personal time incurred by representing Polkadot.\n\nChris, visionary behind the initiative, after the University reached out to him through Athelo Group in the fall of 2024, steaming from the Conor Daly and Inter Miami CF (IMCF) partnerships with Polkadot. He flew to Miami multiple times at his own expense since October 2024 to meet with faculty, staff, the Dean, and Associate Dean, establishing credibility through the IMCF relationship. Chris represented Polkadot as presenting sponsor at the Annual Blockchain Conference, coordinated involvement from Parity, Web3 Foundation (W3F), Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA), EasyA, Events Bounty and local ambassadors to engage the Schools of Business, Engineering, and Arts/Sciences (Computer Science). In addition to the conference, Chris coordinated a tour for EasyA brothers Phil and Dom in the fall of 2024 to help strengthen relationships with the University. During conference week in May 2025, he co-facilitated the Miami Freedom Park (MFP) tour with Salvatore Esposito, provided exceptional hospitality at Inter Miami games engaging UM faculty (e.g., Dean Paul Pavlou, Professor Ola Henfridsson) and industry figures (e.g., Mike Spagnola, VISA, Jose Mas, Co-Owner IMCF) with James and Sal, delivered opening remarks, participated in panels and networking, and handled working with the Events Bounty for presenting partner, flights, and hotels for the conference.\n\n## **Achievements During Conference Week**\n\n* Delivered impactful opening remarks alongside James Slusser, reinforcing Polkadot’s leadership in the blockchain space and at the conference and positioning Miami as a U.S. hub for 4IR that includes blockchain.  \n* Co-facilitated the MFP (Miami Freedom Park) tour with Salvatore Esposito, advancing discussions on a physical U.S. presence and partnerships.  \n* Supported hosting of high-profile guests at Inter Miami games (e.g., vs. Montreal on May 28 and vs. Columbus on May 31), enhancing Polkadot’s visibility and fostering connections with academics and industry leaders like Jose Mas, Dean Paul Pavlou, Jose Mas, and Mike Spagnola.  \n* Contributed to post-event follow-ups with James, PBA, W3F, EasyA, and UM faculty to pursue blockchain curriculum integration, research collaborations, hackathons, and student placements laying groundwork for a multi-year partnership including a Blockchain Technology Fall Certificate, guest lectures, and AI-blockchain synergies.  \n* Pulled in ecosystem projects (PBA, W3F, EasyA) and ambassadors for panels, presentations, and engagements, exceeding metrics with ≥25 academic connections and 5 curriculum/research opportunities.\n\n## **Time Commitment**\n\n* **Since October 2024-May 2025**: Spent many hours (estimated 80+ travel) meeting with UM faculty/staff (e.g., Dean Paul Pavlou, Associate Dean Ola Henfridsson, Professors Yelena Yesha, Sakhrat Khizroev, Rony Shir, Dania), and coordinating ecosystem involvement efforts not compensated and foundational to the event's success.  \n* **Tuesday, May 27 (4 hours)**: Attended and supported the monthly Polkadot Miami meetup organized by James Slusser and Salvatore Esposito.  \n* **Wednesday, May 28 (3 hours)**: Hosted guests at Inter Miami game vs. Montreal, engaging PBA, W3F, Professor Ola Henfridsson, and Mike Spagnola (VISA).  \n* **Thursday, May 29 (5 hours)**: Participated in the campus tour, engaging UM faculty and staff; met with the Dean to discuss partnerships.  \n* **Friday, May 30 (8 hours)**: Attended the first full day of the conference, delivering opening remarks, networking with attendees (e.g., panelists from other universities, Plug In Play), and participating in reception/lunch.  \n* **Saturday, May 31 (7 hours)**: Engaged in conference activities, including PBA presentation follow-ups; hosted guests at Inter Miami game vs. Columbus with Dean Paul Pavlou, his wife, and Plug In Play representatives.  \n* **Post-event (10 hours)**: Handled lead distribution to PBA (Marina Marchesotti, Giselle Heleg), W3F (Filippo Franchini) and ambassadors; coordinated with UM's Orestes Hernandez on follow-ups for hackathons, research, and hiring plus submitted the full bounty report.\n\nThe time being requested is for that spent directly interfacing with University of Miami staff, conference attendees, and ecosystem coordination, though his visionary role and months of uncompensated groundwork far exceed this request. I kindly ask the community to consider the compensation (less than hours put in). The results of his work have produced ongoing talks with the University of Miami and W3F on research related case studies as well as PBA being offered as certificate courses through the university. \n\n## **Sources**\n\n### **X Posts:**\n\n* @LearnPolkadot, Campus Tour: [https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928094687383986670](https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928094687383986670)  \n* @LearnPolkadot, Filippo’s Talk: [https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928469373695537535](https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928469373695537535)  \n* @LearnPolkadot, Panel Discussion: [https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928530670336221254](https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928530670336221254)  \n* @LearnPolkadot, PBA Presentation: [https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928868214957625707](https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1928868214957625707)  \n* @LearnPolkadot, Inter Miami Match: [https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1929054794641007103](https://x.com/LearnPolkadot/status/1929054794641007103)  \n* @The\\_Weak\\_Hand, Mas and Dean Paul: [https://x.com/The\\_Weak\\_Hand/status/1929961884016398611](https://x.com/The_Weak_Hand/status/1929961884016398611)  \n* @TheThePhunky1: [https://x.com/TheThePhunky1/status/1928114833662103952](https://x.com/TheThePhunky1/status/1928114833662103952)  \n* @openminded Miami a strategic play: [https://x.com/\\_\\_open\\_minded/status/1928558610881089860](https://x.com/__open_minded/status/1928558610881089860)\n\n### **LinkedIn Posts:**\n\n* Filippo Franchini, Conference Participation: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filippoweb3\\_this-week-i-was-honored-to-speak-at-the-activity-7335039263513763840-UisN](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filippoweb3_this-week-i-was-honored-to-speak-at-the-activity-7335039263513763840-UisN)  \n* Filippo Franchini, Inter Miami Partnership: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filippoweb3\\_this-is-a-success-story-about-polkadot-activity-7335664043837247488-fsx3](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filippoweb3_this-is-a-success-story-about-polkadot-activity-7335664043837247488-fsx3)  \n* Marina Marchesotti, AI Synergies: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marina-marchesotti\\_descentralizaciaejn-tokenizaciaejn-educaciaejn-activity-7335981347057950721-zBle](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/marina-marchesotti_descentralizaciaejn-tokenizaciaejn-educaciaejn-activity-7335981347057950721-zBle)  \n* Christopher Wade, UM Engagement: [https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7335457765089308672?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7335457765089308672%2C7335482321145417730%29](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7335457765089308672?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7335457765089308672%2C7335482321145417730%29)  \n* University of Miami, Conference Recap: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7335924462510387200-EFn5](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7335924462510387200-EFn5)  \n* Flávia Salmázio-Machado, Presentation: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fl%C3%A1via-salm%C3%A1zio-4b62761b9\\_last-week-i-had-the-honor-of-sharing-the-activity-7335421841026514945-9z1N](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fl%C3%A1via-salm%C3%A1zio-4b62761b9_last-week-i-had-the-honor-of-sharing-the-activity-7335421841026514945-9z1N)  \n* Flávia Salmázio-Machado, Inter Miami Match: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fl%C3%A1via-salm%C3%A1zio-4b62761b9\\_i-experienced-a-soccer-match-with-messi-playing-activity-7336059790567067650-6K\\_K](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fl%C3%A1via-salm%C3%A1zio-4b62761b9_i-experienced-a-soccer-match-with-messi-playing-activity-7336059790567067650-6K_K)  \n* Roman Beck Professor: [https://www.linkedin.com/posts/profromanbeck\\_it-was-a-pleasure-meeting-roman-beck-youngjin-activity-7335917654752288769-PfvU?utm\\_source=share\\&utm\\_medium=member\\_desktop\\&rcm=ACoAAAZvL00BfkEPcVV-lPjaTPq8bzIEbxJ5xD](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/profromanbeck_it-was-a-pleasure-meeting-roman-beck-youngjin-activity-7335917654752288769-PfvU?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAZvL00BfkEPcVV-lPjaTPq8bzIEbxJ5xDA)",

By participating in this program, my goal is to make a positive impact on the discussion space, fostering an environment of continuous improvement.\" [https://forum.polkadot.network/t/decentralized-voices-program-cohort-3-saimon/10219](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/decentralized-voices-program-cohort-3-saimon/10219)\n\n\n\nW3F has led the paid Decentralized Voices initiative to select and reward individuals and groups for their work in reviewing proposals. 3,500 DOT in Cohort 4 and Cohort 3.

      "title": "“What’s Up on Polkadot?” – Your One-Stop Hub for Polkadot Events, Airdrops and Learning Opportunities by web3rdy",
      "content": "When someone leans in and asks, “**What’s up on Polkadot?**”, will you know where to look—or are you still lost in a whirlwind of scattered channels?\n\nEntering the Polkadot universe shouldn’t feel like decoding a maze. Today, over 240 projects blast a constant stream of updates—airdrops, governance votes, community meetups—each splintered across its own social channels. New users jump from Telegram to Twitter to Discord, chasing scattered links and risking scams or outdated information. Social media only grabs a few seconds of attention, and no one truly knows who’s interested or who follows through.\n\n**Problem statement:**\n\n&#x20;As social feeds age without fresh newcomers, conversations stall and posts become repetitive—driving even more people away. With fewer new voices, algorithms hide stale content, creating a downward spiral of engagement decay.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n**web3rdy** solves this by gathering every Polkadot event, incentive, and learning opportunity onto a single, user-friendly and clutter free website:\n\n* **Simple Event Calendar:** See all upcoming airdrops, hackathons, incentive, workshops, and important voting deadlines in one glance—no more endless scrolling.\n* **Clear Next Steps:** Each listing gives you all links, when it happens, and where to participate, so newcomers spend their time joining events, not hunting for instructions.\n* **Stay Engaged:** Get friendly reminders—turning one-off visits into lasting involvement.\n\nProjects benefit too: instead of shouting into a crowded social feed, teams reach a motivated audience actively browsing **web3rdy**. Organizers get simple feedback, so they can optimize incentives and grow stronger communities.\n\n**Funding Request:** We ask the Polkadot Treasury to grant **1,000 DOT** for **six months** of operational support. This will cover:\n\n1. **Platform Hosting & Maintenance:** Keep **web3rdy** fast, secure, and up-to-date.\n2. **Content Curation & Partnerships:** Onboard top Polkadot teams and learning partners to seed quality events.\n3. **User Outreach:** Promote **web3rdy** through ambassadorships and co-marketing with ecosystem projects, aiming to welcome at least **500 new participants** for the initial growth phase.\n\nBy unifying event discovery in one place, **web3rdy** ensures that every newcomer finds their path and every project finds its audience. With your support, we’ll transform how users explore and engage with Polkadot—driving real growth, participation, and long-term network strength.\n\nOur MVP: [**www.web3rdy.com**](https://www.web3rdy.com/ \"www.web3rdy.com\")\n\n**web3rdy** serves as one essential “Discovery Pillar” of Polkadot onboarding, centralizing all ecosystem events into one clear hub that transforms curious newcomers into active participants.",

      "content": "**Introduction**\n\nThe **Polkadot Builder Map** is an interactive map that translates the technical complexity of Polkadot into an intuitive visualization (60 components, 8 languages). Validated by experts, it helps developers navigate the ecosystem in less time and with better context than traditional extensive documentation.\n\n![Main-map.JPG](https://i.ibb.co/BVNkX81L/Main-map.jpg)\n\n**Key Features**\n\n✅ Multilingual: 8 languages covering 85% of the global population (English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Afrikaans, Chinese, and Hindi).\n\n✅ 60 technical components mapped:\n\n• Clear descriptions + programming languages + links to official documentation.\n\n• Organized into 3 layers: Core Infrastructure, Parachains, and Tools/APIs.\n\n✅ Accessible design: Compatible with mobile and desktop.\n\nSo far, these have been the countries from which the most inquiries have been made.\n\n![ranking by country.JPG](https://i.ibb.co/hRvRpp8j/ranking-by-country.jpg)\n\n**Differential vs. Polkadot Wiki**\n\nWhile the Polkadot Wiki is a comprehensive technical repository, the Builder Map offers:\n\n• Intuitive visualization of relationships between components.\n\n• Condensed information to reduce hours of learning.\n\n• Practical approach: Ideal for developers looking to integrate quickly.\n\n**Open source content available** in the repository: [https://github.com/Themvp07/PolkadotBuilderMap](https://github.com/Themvp07/PolkadotBuilderMap)\n\n**Work done**\n\nOver the past 17 months, I have developed and refined the Polkadot Builder Map, an interactive tool that simplifies the technical complexity of Polkadot. This visual map organizes the key components of the ecosystem (60 elements so far) into intuitive layers, with clear descriptions, programming languages, and links to official documentation. The tool is available in eight languages, covering 85% of the global population, and has been validated by ecosystem experts such as Shawn Tabrizi, the Gossamer and Kagome teams, and others, during events in Brussels, Berlin, Barcelona, and Bangkok.\n\n**Previous Versions (Non-Interactive)**\n\n![versions.png](https://i.ibb.co/v6wNfSYG/versions.png)\n\n**Validation Received**\n\n![b3.png](https://i.ibb.co/mCT2nyZX/b3.png)\n\n**This proposal seeks:**\n\n1\\. Compensation for the work already completed, which includes over 200 hours of analysis, development, design, expert validation, translations, and technical implementation.\n\n2\\. Resources for ongoing support for 6 months, with the following objectives:\n\n* Technical maintenance: Issue fixes, component updates, and UI/UX improvements.\n* Migration to a separate website: To provide a better experience outside of GitHub Pages.\n* Implementation of community improvements: Prioritizing user suggestions.\n* Active support: Question resolution, additional documentation, and feedback sessions with ecosystem developers.\n\n**Community Responsiveness**\n\nThis resource was enabled for community use and consultation 3 weeks ago and also has a forum topic where changes will continue to be communicated.&#x20;\n\nDuring that time, two specific issues were created and resolved via GitHub.\n\n![issues closed.JPG](https://i.ibb.co/VY1zfw3s/issues-closed.jpg)\n\nA thread was also created on X explaining the map and its creation process. Below are some of the impressions and comments received from the community.

These contributions are either already released or in the process of being merged for further release.\n\n## Motivation\n\nIn the last year, I made three major contributions to the Polkadot SDK, which impact the user experience of Asset Hub/Polkadot Hub.\n\n- [#3951] (_already released_): \n    - Provides basic support for _freezes_ (_locks_) using assets in the Asset Hub. This enables the possibility, among others, of vesting assets ([#7404]).\n- [#4530] (_already released_): \n    - Provides basic support for holds (deposits) using assets in the Asset Hub. This is connected to an upcoming project to determine which asset to use for paying deposits (utilising a conversion model) when signing a transaction, or even paying for deposits using stablecoins or ETH across the bridge.\n    - Refactors the balances model (the way balances are calculated) for asset accounts to be in line with the way native token balances are calculated.\n- [#7404] (_in final review_): Brings `pallet-vesting` to assets, so people can make vested transfers of (among others) stablecoins or tokens in Asset Hub. Made possible by [#3951].\n\nIn total, the measured amount for these contributions (measured in time spent, with a fixed hourly rate) exceeds the already compensated amount.\n\n## Cost Breakdown\n\nMeasured amount: `$9,800` (with a rate of `$50/h`).\n\n- Time spent in the three projects: `196h` (`~1.84 mo`)\n\n\nAlready compensated amount: `$2,224.346`\n\n- 2 months of Fellowship salary: `$1,666.666`.\n- Tip for [#3951]: `$557.68` (`80 DOT` at `$6.971/DOT` — EMA 7).\n\nRemaining amount: `$7,575.654`\n\n<!-- References and footnotes -->\n\n[#3951]: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3951\n[#4530]: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4530\n[#7404]: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/7404\n",

Minimum staking yield analysis\n7. Staking yield vs staked amount industry analysis\n8. What non-inflation Revenue sources do we have available?\n9. What are the past & future sources of these revenues?\n10. What ecosystems have top revenues, and specific sources\n11. Chart past revenues for Polkadot\n12. Model Future revenues\n13.

      "content": "Hello community,\n\nOn this occasion, I would like to present a tribute to [AG](https://x.com/angeinweb3) and me for our work as Polkadot ambassadors during the activities held from Monday 9th to Friday 13th June in Caracas.\n\nAs you can see on [Space4Build's](https://x.com/space4build) social media, I participated as a speaker at the Institutional Conference \"New Web3 Business Models\" organized by the Venezuelan Banking Association. For four days, this event brought together representatives from the financial system, academia, auditing firms, real-estate companies, regulatory authorities, radio and television media, and technology providers.&#x20;\n\n[Reference1](https://x.com/Space4Build/status/1934721989165342789)\n[Reference2](https://x.com/Space4Build/status/1934722629753295365)\n\n![photo\\_5105252300351451090\\_w.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/mCYQfPGG/photo-5105252300351451090-w.jpg)\n\n\nThis event allowed us to showcase Polkadot technology to the country's entrepreneurs, executives, and legislators in a way that had never been done before. During the four days of the institutional conference, we answered questions from participants and made the necessary contacts to advance each organization's projects.\n\n\n![photo\\_5105252300351451089\\_w.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/PpBPrTJ/photo-5105252300351451089-w.jpg)\n\n\nDuring the four days of activities, attendance averaged 150, reaching a peak of 170 on the last day, which was my presentation. The main features of the technology available in Polkadot and its ecosystem were presented to this audience.\n\nI would like to mention that although the activity was private and had a ticket fee, we did not receive any compensation for our participation.\n\nAdditionally, we held a private meeting with the Director of the United Nations Development Programme (PUND, [https://x.com/pnud](https://x.com/pnud)) in Venezuela and the business partnership manager, who expressed interest in incorporating Polkadot technology into the sustainable development projects they are carrying out. Reference3: [https://x.com/simonxpe/status/1935718653661479099](https://x.com/simonxpe/status/1935718653661479099)\n\n\n![photo\\_5105252300351451091\\_w.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/B2qF0xNV/photo-5105252300351451091-w.jpg)\n\n\nAs an additional note, during our stay in Caracas, we also held a meetup with several biker communities, mostly entrepreneurs who also want to use the technology in their activities to make their activities more transparent. This specific meetup will be presented to the meetup bounty in the coming days. Reference4: [https://x.com/space4build/status/1935380151816307048?s=46\\&t=xZwu9y0l8ACyMwWB7pH3Rg](https://x.com/space4build/status/1935380151816307048?s=46\\&t=xZwu9y0l8ACyMwWB7pH3Rg)\n\n![photo\\_5105252300351451088\\_w.jpg](https://i.ibb.co/fgXZkjV/photo-5105252300351451088-w.jpg)\n\n\nIn closing, I would like to add that neither AG nor I are part of any ecosystem organization or treasury, and as ambassadors, we have not received sponsorship or PIF for these activities.\n\nWe kindly request 250 DOTs each for our time.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSaimon ([https://x.com/simonxpe](https://x.com/simonxpe/status/1935718653661479099))",

Through careful financial stewardship — managed solely by myself — $230,000 remained in the Ambassador Fellowship fund. The plan was to distribute $29,000 to the team, with the remaining $201,000 returned to the treasury when the Board stepped down (five weeks later than anticipated).\n\nThe delivery deadline was met, and the Advisory Board confirmed the work was completed successfully.\n\nHowever, during this period, several Board members resigned due to the extended duration of their roles. With diminished capacity and activity, decision-making became increasingly difficult.

This success was largely thanks to the dedication of individuals who stepped up as volunteers to ensure we not only met but exceeded our deliverables within the agreed timeframe.\n\nPer the agreement with the Advisory Board (see[ <u>Sprint Overview Document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zc0WAzXezZSFryfZ-xlpLPt4xgouvl4mLamy60fO15k/edit?usp=drive_link)), a discretionary payment was to be made to the core team upon successful delivery by May 3, 2025. Through careful financial stewardship — managed solely by myself — $230,000 remained in the Ambassador Fellowship fund. The plan was to distribute $29,000 to the team, with the remaining $201,000 returned to the treasury when the Board stepped down (five weeks later than anticipated).\n\nThe delivery deadline was met, and the Advisory Board confirmed the work was completed successfully.\n\nHowever, during this period, several Board members resigned due to the extended duration of their roles. With diminished capacity and activity, decision-making became increasingly difficult. Ultimately, the remaining funds — including the portion intended for the team — were returned in full to the treasury for administrative ease. As a result, the promised payments were not made.\n\nToday, the Ambassador Fellowship remains active and is preparing a proposal for further funding to support its continued growth. Cohort Two is currently being seeded, and a waitlist for Cohort Three is already forming — a clear sign of the program's community value and continued success. You can find our[ <u>Delivery Report here</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WwkjxAzOe5SIbSICl5vcQ2ziAtnUCwe/view?usp=drive_link).\n\nAfter careful consideration and consultation, I believe the fairest path forward is to submit individual compensation requests on behalf of each team member. These individuals fulfilled their commitments and contributed significantly to the Fellowship’s outcomes. The full list of team members and corresponding payment amounts can be found in this[ <u>Spreadsheet</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16J8qxv9-Z0ky35yRFn-OlkuxoRZt5s7XO75kwtsFSoQ/edit?gid=755697593#gid=755697593).\n\nThank you for your continued support of the team, the principle of fairness within the ecosystem, and the enduring impact of the Ambassador Fellowship.",

Unlock mulit-sig RFPs for Polkadot **\n2. Enable bounty curators to associate Child Bounties with RFPs\n3. Deploy “RFP Board” to consolidate ecosystem RFPs across Kusama/Polkadot Treasuries &  Kusama/Polkadot Child Bounties created through the app.\n\n\n### Milestones\n\n**Milestone 1, Polkadot Multi-sig RFPs:**  \n$2,000 USD  \n10 days  \n1. Install Polkadot Multi-sig RFP functionality\n2. Test UI\n3. Validated by Supervisors\n\n**Milestone 2, Child Bounty RFPs:**  \n$3,000 USD  \n13 days  \n1. Connect Wallet\n2. If bounty curator, enable creation of Child Bounty RFP\n3. Generate markdown text for Child Bounty page\n4. Test UI\n5. Validated by Supervisors\n\n**Milestone 3, UI & Mainnet Deployment:**  \n$3,000 USD  \n8 days\n1. Integrate Polkadot Multi-sig RFPs & Childbounty RFPs into rfp.fund\n2. “Bounty Board” to consolidate ecosystem RFPs\n3. Simple sorting and filters\n4. Validated by Supervisors\n\n\n---\n\n** Multi-sig RFPs vs. Bounty RFPs for Polkadot\n\nTo compete with Spend proposals, Polkadot RFPs must support stablecoin management, requiring multi-sig setups since Bounties lack multi-asset spending. While stablecoin RFPs are efficient, the Treasury cannot revoke funds as with Bounties—a rarely used feature. DOT holders should evaluate proposed supervisors carefully.\n\nWe’re actively supporting a new [Bounty Pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/8768) with multi-asset and cross-chain capabilities, advocating for its swift inclusion in the runtime and then [rfp.fund](https://www.rfp.fund/).",

      "userId": 25507,
      "content": "This referendum proposes allocating 500 DOT from the treasury to establish a Community Building Fund for Bend-PVM, aimed at expanding the contributor base and fostering an active developer ecosystem around this innovative smart contract language optimized for PolkaVM.\n\n## Community-Driven Development Model\nRather than funding a small core team, this proposal takes a decentralized approach by creating incentives for a broader community of developers to contribute to Bend-PVM's evolution. The requested funds will be strategically deployed to nurture a thriving contributor ecosystem through:\n\n- Contributor rewards for merged pull requests and significant improvements\n- Hackathons and coding challenges with DOT prizes for specific feature implementations\n- Bug bounty program to strengthen the language's security and reliability\n- Educational resources and workshops to onboard new contributors\n\n## Funding Allocation\nThe 500 DOT will be distributed as follows:\n- 60% (300 DOT): Direct contributor rewards for code contributions\n- 20% (100 DOT): Community hackathons and development challenges\n- 15% (75 DOT): Educational content creation and developer workshops\n- 5% (25 DOT): Administration and transparent fund management\n\n## Strategic Community Goals\nThis community-centric approach addresses critical ecosystem needs:\n1. Knowledge Distribution: Prevent single points of failure by spreading expertise across multiple contributors\n2. Innovation Acceleration: Harness diverse perspectives to solve complex language design challenges\n3. Ecosystem Growth: Create pathways for Ethereum developers to become active Polkadot contributors\n4. Sustainable Development: Establish a self-reinforcing community that outlasts any single funding round\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n- Increase monthly active contributors from current baseline to 25+ within 6 months\n- Achieve 10+ educational workshops/events to onboard new developers\n- Complete 3 targeted hackathons addressing specific language features\n- Establish a transparent contribution tracking system with clear reward criteria\n\n## Governance Transparency\nAll fund distributions will be publicly recorded and verified through a designated multi-signature account. Monthly reports will detail contributor rewards, event expenditures, and development progress metrics.\n\n## Community Benefits\nThis community-first approach will:\n- Accelerate Bend-PVM development through parallel workstreams\n- Create a sustainable pipeline of skilled PolkaVM developers\n- Strengthen Polkadot's position as a developer-friendly ecosystem\n- Demonstrate the effectiveness of treasury funds in fostering grassroots innovation\n\n## Social \n- https://bend-pvm.aipop.fun\n- https://github.com/developerfred/Bend-PVM\n\nWe invite all stakeholders to support this referendum to build a vibrant, community-driven development ecosystem around Bend-PVM and position Polkadot as the home for next-generation smart contract innovation.\n",

      "content": "I would like to propose a tip for James Slusser and myself for our advocacy of the Polkadot ecosystem on Wednesday, April 16th during FBBA's \"Blockchain Day\" in Tallahassee. We both had an incredible day networking with legislators in both the House and Senate, answering their questions and telling them about Polkadot.\n\nIn every meeting we had with legislators and their aides, James went to great lengths to explain : 1) what Polkadot is; 2) how our governance system works; 3) why our security and scalability provide enterprise grade solutions via blockchain technology; 4) that the State of Florida should provide a legal framework for DAOs.\n\nLater in the afternoon, we had an hour long roundtable with Commissioner Weigel and his staff at the Office of Financial Regulation, during which we both encouraged them to continue their work with the Florida Bar to investigate potential avenues to craft legal language that could be used for. a future bill during the next legislative session.\n\nMoreover, thanks to DOT token holders previous decision to join the FBBA (Florida Business Blockchain Association), President Sam Armes made sure that Polkadot was recognized in both chambers before the House and Senate began conducting their legal business for the day.\n\nYou can read a longer reflection that I posted on X the next day [HERE](https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1912854196627341624).\n\nOn a final note, I would like the community to know that neither of us was previously compensated to do this advocacy work. The tip will help defray the costs of getting to the capitol, and spending nearly 10 hours of our time there on behalf of Polkadot.\n\nThank you in advance for your consideration,\n\nPhunky\n\n![1C91024D-1903-4C42-9469-530FF77952F1.jpeg](https://i.ibb.co/gXMv1nJ/mdx-Editor-Phunky-1745455406608.jpg)",

      "title": "Provision of Snowbridge ETH Liquidity to Facilitate Fee Swaps",
      "content": "# Summary\nWe're back again with another classic banger.\n\nThis referendum forms part of a series of proposals that attempts to improve the UX for users bridging assets to the Polkadot ecosystem from Ethereum via Snowbridge.\n\nCurrently, the user experience for users wishing to bridge assets into the ecosystem is less than ideal. Users are not able to deploy capital into the ecosystem, leading to users feeling frustrated as they are not experiencing their desired UX, including but not limited to the following reasons:\nThere is not sufficiently deep liquidity for Snowbridge assets for users wishing to deploy any meaningful amounts of assets in the ecosystem (outside of the scope of this referendum)\nThere is not sufficient liquidity for Snowbridge assets on Polkadot Asset Hub to facilitate fee payment swaps\n\t\nThis referendum requests ~$2,000 of DOT tokens. If/when this referendum is approved, half of this DOT will be converted into MRL WETH via Hydration, bridged to Ethereum via Wormhole, and then bridged back to Polkadot via Snowbridge. This ETH will be paired against the equivalent amount of DOT on Polkadot Asset Hub to facilitate fee payment swaps.\n\nIt should be noted that this is Snowbridge ETH, and not WETH.\n\nNote: there is already a liquidity pool of Snowbridge ETH/DOT that exists, however the liquidity is very shallow, and we have seen from the shallow liquidity of the DOT/KSM pool that this can lead to users paying an arm and a leg for their txn fees. Increasing the liquidity of these pools can help delay these issues and hopefully by raising these referendums, people will learn about these liquidity pools, and hopefully arbitrage them, keeping the price normalized.\n\nThere is an additional 50 DOT added which is intended to cover transaction fees across various blockchains, and act as a small tip / beer money.\n\n# Problem Statement\nPolkadot OpenGov has funded the development of Snowbridge quite extensively, however, there are some underlying UX issues inhibiting user adoption that are primarily caused by a lack of liquidity.\n\nCurrently, when a user bridges assets to the Polkadot ecosystem via Snowbridge, they are not able to utilize them. This is due to the two primary issues listed above. \n\nAs stated, one issue is that there is very shallow liquidity on Polkadot Asset Hub to facilitate fee payment swaps. The ELI5 of this is that you can utilize other assets to pay for fees on Asset Hub, and in the background, it is swapped for DOT to pay the fee. This, however, requires that a pool actually exists with some level of liquidity (such as what we are proposing).\n\nIf users are able to have their Snowbridge assets swapped for DOT to pay for fees, then they are able to deploy their tokens to other parts of the ecosystem, where deeper liquidity may exist in the future.\n\nCurrently, these issues are making the onboarding experience rather bad for those coming from other ecosystems to Polkadot, we need to improve this. The lack of Snowbridge assets being held in the ecosystems showcases potential issues with adoption, and these pain points may be a root cause of why people are not bridging assets from Ethereum to Polkadot.\n\n# Proposition\nWe propose to deploy and add liquidity to the ETH/DOT pool, which should further alleviate this fee payment swap issue.\n\nSince we will receive DOT, we need to convert it to MRL WETH on Hydration, and then use Wormhole to bridge the WETH to Ethereum and convert it to ETH, and then bridge the ETH back to the Polkadot ecosystem using Snowbridge.\n\nWe will then utilize this Snowbridge ETH and the DOT to top up the liquidity pool.\n\nThe funds will be sent to a 2/2 multisig consisting of Leemo (Novasama Technologies) and lolmcshizz (Hydration).\n\n# Closing Thoughts\nIt is important that people in the ecosystem are able to use the products that people have spent a lot of time building and that we have spent a lot of funds on. These pain points are immediately clear to anyone using the ecosystem's tools.\n\nAs we stated at the top of the proposal, we are aware that there is a lack of sufficiently deep liquidity for Snowbridge assets, for Snowbridge ETH in particular, the Hydration DAO will soon vote on OTCing some of their WETH into Snowbridge ETH, which should increase adoption, which is part of the reason why we want to top up this liquidity pool for fee payments.\n\nCheers,\n\nLeemo, lolmcshizz, and Crane\n\nDelegate to ChaosDAO: https://chaosdao.org/ \n",

      "content": "# Summary\nThis referendum forms part of a series of proposals which attempts to improve the UX for users bridging USDT & USDC (hereinafter “stables”) to the Polkadot ecosystem from Ethereum via Snowbridge.\n\nCurrently, the user experience for users wishing to bridge stables into the ecosystem is less than ideal. Users are not able to deploy capital into the ecosystem, leading to users feeling frustrated as they are not experiencing their desired UX, including but not limited to the following reasons:\nThere is not sufficiently deep liquidity for Snowbridge wrapped stables for users wishing to deploy any meaningful amounts of stables in the ecosystem (outside of the scope of this referendum)\nThere is not sufficient liquidity for Snowbridge-wrapped stables on Polkadot Asset Hub to facilitate fee payment swaps\n\t\nThis referendum requests 1,000 USDT, 1,000 USDC, and $2000 worth of DOT tokens. The native stables will be converted via various means (detailed below) into Snowbridge wrapped stables. The stables will then be paired against the equivalent amount of DOT on Polkadot Asset Hub to facilitate fee payment swaps.\n\nThere is an additional 50 DOT added which is intended to cover transaction fees across various blockchains, and act as a small tip / beer money.\nProblem Statement\nPolkadot OpenGov has funded the development of Snowbridge quite extensively, however, there are some underlying UX issues inhibiting user adoption that are primarily caused by a lack of liquidity.\n\nCurrently, when a user bridges stables to the Polkadot ecosystem via Snowbridge, they are not able to utilize them. This is due to the two primary issues listed above. \n\nAs stated, one issue is that there is currently no liquidity on Polkadot Asset Hub to facilitate fee payment swaps. The ELI5 of this is that you can utilize other assets to pay for fees on Asset Hub, and in the background, it is swapped for DOT to pay the fee. This, however, requires that a pool actually exists with some level of liquidity (such as what we are proposing).\n\nIf users are able to have their Snowbridge stables swapped for DOT to pay for fees, then they are able to deploy their tokens to other parts of the ecosystem, where deeper liquidity may exist in the future.\n\nCurrently, these issues are making the onboarding experience rather bad for those coming from other ecosystems to Polkadot, we need to improve this. The lack of Snowbridge [USDT](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/foreign_assets/a713586200214506f7a0582655aec9fec6acc721) & [USDC](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/foreign_assets/7d0abd4e76e86720198b8a796ba17ae82a685d33) holders in the ecosystems showcases potential issues with adoption, and these pain points may be a root cause of why people are not bridging stables from Ethereum to Polkadot (bridging stables is one of the primary use cases for bridges).\n\n# Proposition\nWe propose to deploy two liquidity pools, which should alleviate this fee payment swap issue:\nUSDT (Snowbridge) / DOT\nUSDC (Snowbridge) / DOT\n\nSince we will receive native stables, we need to bridge them over to Ethereum and then bridge them back to the ecosystem using Snowbridge. The likely route we will take is:\nSwap native stables for [MRL](https://moonbeam.network/news/mrl-vs-bridge-liquidity-explainer) stables via Hydration\nBridge [MRL](https://moonbeam.network/news/mrl-vs-bridge-liquidity-explainer) stables to Ethereum via Wormhole\nBridge stables from Ethereum to Polkadot via Snowbridge\nWe will then utilize these Snowbridge-wrapped stables and the DOT to create liquidity pools.\n\nThere is a chance that the exact amount of liquidity deployed may be marginally lower than the numbers presented above, but not by any meaningful amount.\n\nThe funds will be sent to a 2/2 multisig consisting of Leemo (Novasama Technologies) and lolmcshizz (Hydration).\n\n# Closing Thoughts\nIt is important that people in the ecosystem are able to use the products that people have spent a lot of time building and that we have spent a lot of funds on. These pain points are immediately clear to anyone using the ecosystem's tools.\n\nAs we stated at the top of the proposal, we are aware that there is a lack of sufficiently deep liquidity for Snowbridge-wrapped stables, and we are in discussions with Polkadot Ecosystem Agents to attempt to resolve this issue without the use of the Treasury. In the event that those discussions are not fruitful, we will be requesting funds from the treasury to hopefully alleviate this issue.\n\nCheers,\n\n[Leemo](https://x.com/LeemoXD), [lolmcshizz](https://x.com/lolmcshizz), and [Crane](https://x.com/0xCrane)\n\nDelegate to ChaosDAO: https://chaosdao.org/ \n",

      "title": "[Retroactive Funding] JAM SDK Implementation of reusable service",
      "content": "Hello people, i want to introduce my project “JAM Whitelist Role Authorizer”, an implementation that uses the JAM SDK to provide a role-based and whitelist authorization system. This project is a significant contribution to the Polkadot open source ecosystem and demonstrates the potential of the JAM SDK to develop practical and scalable solutions.\n\nWhat does this project do?  \nThe JAM Whitelist Role Authorizer allows managing authorized addresses, assigning roles (administrator, participant, observer), and running an interactive game where participants answer questions under supervision. The system ensures that only authorized addresses can perform specific actions, ensuring transparency and security in decentralized environments.\n\nAdditionally, the repository’s resources are available in both English🇬🇧 and Spanish 🇪🇸, making it easy to use and understand for a global developers.\n\nOpen Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/Themvp07/JAM-Playground-SDK)\n\nJAM SDK Components Used\n\n1.jam-types (Implemented) Description: This crate contains basic types and structures needed for working with services and authorizers in JAM.\n\nComponents Used:\n\n-   Authorizer: Represents the JAM system's authorizer. It contains two main fields:  \n    code\\_hash: A hash representing the program code.  \n    param: A parameter that can store additional information (e.g., the admin's address).\n-   CodeHash: Represents a 32-byte hash used to validate whether a hash belongs to a list of valid hashes.\n-   AuthParam: A parameter used to store additional data related to authorization.\n\nUsage in the Project:\n\nAuthorizer is used to manage the validation of authorized addresses.\n\nA CodeHash is dynamically generated based on the admin's name and used to verify the authenticity of operations.\n\nAuthParam is extended with the admin's address to track who performed certain actions.\n\n2.jam-pvm-common (Reviewed for Future Implementation) Description: Provides common functionalities for working with the PVM (Parity Virtual Machine).\n\nCurrent Usage: Not explicitly used in the current code.\n\nFuture Suggestion: It could be used to ensure that data generated by the authorizer is compatible with the PVM runtime environment. For example, you could implement specific serialization/deserialization functions to handle data in the format required by the PVM.\n\n3.jam-bootstrap-service (Reviewed, Used as Reference)\n\nDescription: A basic service useful for creating initial configurations (genesis) in JAM.\n\nUsage in the Project: Cloned as a reference to understand how to configure a basic service in JAM.\n\nFuture Suggestion: It could be used to define an initial configuration that includes predefined addresses for the admin, participant, and observer.\n\n4.jam-null-authorizer (Used as a Starting Point, but Not Present in the Current Code) Description: A basic authorizer that allows testing without authorization restrictions.\n\nCurrent Usage: Not explicitly used in the current code.\n\nFuture Suggestion: It could be used as a starting point to implement more advanced test cases. For example, it could be integrated to test scenarios where no authorization is required.\n\n5.jam-pvm-build (Reviewed but Not Publicly Available) Description: A CLI tool that allows building PVM code blobs for services or authorizers.\n\nCurrent Usage: Not explicitly used in the current code.\n\nFuture Suggestion: It could be used to compile the custom authorizer into a deployable PVM blob.\n\nCommunity Value\n\nThis project not only demonstrates how to effectively integrate and use the JAM SDK, but also serves as a practical example for other developers wishing to build similar services. It also:\n\n-   Encourages adoption of the JAM SDK by providing a real,easily adaptable use case for other functional services.\n-   Provides a modular and extensible solution that can adapt to various authorization scenarios in decentralized applications.\n-   Guidance documentation available in multiple languages.\n\nExecution worlflow\n\n1.Assigning roles to participants\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/vxhGQMyx/1.jpg)\n\n2.view main menu\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/j9JtvvCm/2.jpg)\n\n3.Select option 1: Admin validation and selection of number of questions to ask\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/5h7B3tKK/3.jpg)\n\n4.Select option 2: Participant validation and answering questions\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/rXCyxdq/4.jpg)\n\n5.Select option 3: Observer validation and viewing answers\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/zhZc47b4/5.jpg)\n\n6.Select option 4: Verification of user roles and identification vectors\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/kgxJqtq1/6.jpg)\n\nExample of ideas for future implementations\n\nPotential Application in Polkadot Blockchain Academy: This role and authorization system could also be adapted to create a useful scenario in the Polkadot Blockchain Academy. For example, the entrance exam could leverage this resource to be more transparent and fair:\n\n-   Administrator: Defines the questions and manages the process.\n-   Participant: Answers the questions within a limit of operations.\n-   Observer: Monitors the results and ensures impartiality.\n\nBy using a blockchain-based system, it is ensured that the process is immutable, transparent, and verifiable by all involved. This could improve trust in the selection process and make it more inclusive for global candidates.\n\nConnection with video games like DOOM executed in JAM: The system developed is an essential component for managing who can interact with services in JAM. For example:\n\n-   Access Restriction: In the case of DOOM or another video game, it is possible to use this authorizer to restrict who can deploy or run the application.\n-   Role Assignment: We could assign specific roles, such as administrators who can modify game parameters or users who can only play the game.\n\nIn the case of DOOM, these components could be used to:\n\n-   Validate that the DOOM binary has not been modified.\n-   Authorize certain users to run the game.\n-   Store relevant metadata, such as the player address or game state.\n\nThank you for your attention, I hope this resource, documentation and implementation ideas will be useful for everyone. See you in the decentralized future that is getting closer and feel free to share questions and comments =)\n\nNote: Thanks Gav and Parity team by this interesting piece of software",

      "content": "KSM trading recently went live on Hydration after referendum `#490` (https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/490) approved `33,333` KSM in Treasury LP. This has finally opened up liquidity flows between the two chains.\n\nWhen transfers are made between the two using the Kusama <> Polkadot bridge, if a user does not have sufficient KSM/ DOT (depending on the chain) on the receiving network then a portion of the asset they’re sending (e.g. KSM from KAH to PAH) is swapped for the native token to pay for fees. This is excellent UX and prevents user frustration with having to collect fees before bridging assets - however, unfortunately the current liquidity leaves much to be desired and as a result users can get rekt by slippage and lose much larger amounts of their assets to fees than expected.\n\n**This proposal, if approved, will supply `1,000` DOT to a `2/2` multisig with signers Leemo & lolmcshizz** - which combined with referendum `#503` (https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/503) on Kusama for `333` KSM, and will be split between Kusama AssetHub and Polkadot AssetHub `50/50` to provide a base level of liquidity on each network. This will ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for these small swaps and users will only pay the fees they are expecting to when making transfers.\n\n*Any excess tokens will be returned to their respective treasuries.*",

      "title": "First full fledged NFT collection on Polkadot with PVM",
      "content": "I have cooperated with talanted atrist who has worked for Nickelodeon to bring the first full fledged NFT collection right on Polkadot. \n\nThe first full fledged NFT collection on Polkadot\n\nThe first fully unique art collection — 10,000 pieces 1/1 on Polkadot.\n\n  \n  \n**Why do I think we need it:**\n\nFirst of all — the PVM that will be developed and delivered soon (Q2) can significally expand the utility of DOT token. For now — token utilities are very poor for the average retail user, it is intended more for developers (Governance, Staking and Coretime). In my vision, by creating such islands of activity like my NFT collection, we can increase the usability of DOT.\n\nGovernance, Staking and Coretime the main functions of DOT token. Do we need to expand it? I believe — yes! Let's add functionality for average retail users too, let them have some fun here, because as I said before, current functions of DOT token is not really about fun, about building. \n\nI don’t want to say whether this is good or bad, I would prefer to say that we need to remember that the majority in our space are average users. \n\nWe have been building for a long time, people from other chains even saying that Polkadot was built by builders for builders. So let's attract retail to our platform, let them study our blockchain by using it. This will show them the advantages of Polkadot over any other blockchain better than any advertising. The real experience > any form of advertising.\n\nMy NFT collection is just a small piece of puzzle of what we will provide to people with PVM. I believe that other builders and enthusiasts will expand the functionality of the DOT token by creating more activities on chain. By the way — more activity —> more transactions —> more fees to the treasury.\n\nBesides, by attracting many new users to our ecosystem we will also increase healthy competition among developers (we already have a lot of parachains/rollups, but we can have even more) in the race for each user. I think that this is exactly how Polkadot game change season can be started - first new users will come because they are attracted by something interesting, for example minting nft, then they will see that their experience is no worse than on Solana. The transaction speed is the same, the cost of transactions is cheaper than on Ethereum, so the user will like his experience, he will go to check the apps and rollups available on Polkadot among which there are many useful bridges, protocols, defi, depin, rwa, etc.\n\n**Why me and my foundraising:**\n\nI worked in many projects during NFT boom in 2021-2023. I have a lot of experience:\n\nCollabed with a lot of huge influencers such as @beeple ([https://x.com/beeple](https://x.com/beeple)) — 825k followers, @deekaymotion ([https://x.com/deekaymotion](https://x.com/deekaymotion)) — 225k followers.   \n  \nThe largest project that I managed is Lunar Project ([https://magiceden.io/marketplace/lunar](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/lunar)) — 10k NFT's sold, 2,000,000$ raised, 3,500,000$ trading volume (1 week).\n\nMy connections and my experience will be very needed in my strategy is to use not only Polkadot audience, but to go beyond our ecosystem and attract the attention of those who were not familiar with the Polkadot ecosystem before — SOL and ETH users. I would like to show them that our chain can work smoothly, quickly and cheaply. Although Solana has the last two advantages, for ETH users they may seem very significant (remember that the most popular gaming ecosystem MYTH was migrated to Polkadot because of this).\n\nI think that a good start can become a trend, and many more creators and even just artists will want to do the same — create their own NFT collections or other onchain activities.\n\n**Why I made this request:**\n\n— I am creating a symbolic request for 1000 DOT to use in initial marketing, as well as for another main purpose - to find out how many people support my idea and whether the Polkadot community wants the appearance of a project of this format at all.\n\n— Form the very first project audience from those who voted (no matter NAY or AYE), giving them a priority place in the future minting process (WL spots — all voters will be able to mint first and cheaper).\n\nAll other costs (including salaries, game development, art and promo) will be covered personally by me, not by the Polkadot treasury.\n\nThe request is created in advance because I need to hear from the community and start development to be ready launch right with PVM.\n\n**About my future NFT collection:**\n\nThe art is a collaboration between the artist and AI. There will be 10,000 images(near to 10,000 new polkadot holders). I am going to create an NFT collection using PVM, one way or another it will work directly on the Polkadot chain (or on Polkadot Hub), not on the parachains. \n\nThe minting will be through a contract, for the first time.\n\nMany may mistakenly think that the NFT trend has lost popularity and passed, but look at MYTH — projects with gamified utilities are still working and are still very popular. Therefore, my collection will be supplemented with a simulation game in which 10,000 autonomous AI agents will interact with each other in the world. \n\nBasicly, each holder of my collection will be able to spectate their own agent (the one they minted). General supply of the collection will be deflationary, some NFTs will be burned at some point, due to the fact that one character will be able to, for example, fight with another — we don't know how AI will behave himself, but each NFT's will have unique traits of character traits. Because of this, the value of some NFT's will gradually increase. Along with the attention that will be received thanks to the continuous stream on YouTube of the world in which all the characters will exist.\n\nAll donations from streaming on YouTube (and not only donations) will make up the prize pool in DOT, which NFT owners will earn for staking. If you stake your NFT, you earn, but you also have a chance to lose your character forever.\n\nThe uniqueness of the project is that each art is completely unique 1/1. This has not been in any collection on Ethereum or Solana. It will appear on Polkadot for the first time.\n\nIn summary we have AI generated art in combine with AI utility, and that's all secured by Polkadot.\n\n**Just a short story:**\n\nI started my journey in crypto by minting NFT's on Ethereum blockchain. It was possible to do this on Solana too, but for a number of reasons all the hype was focused on Ethereum. And everything would have been so, but suddenly people began to notice that Solana was much faster and cheaper. Solana became a competitor to Ethereum. Just imagine this, Solana is now next to Ethereum, but in 2022 the gap was much wider. Yes, only in one area, but still better. Then people realized that Solana is better not only in minting NFT's, but also in minting meme coins. Imagine how many people Solana has absorbed from Ethereum, how many people have migrated to Solana from Ethereum. It was Solana season — the influx of users was colossal, and following the hype, developers came. No one was afraid that building here might not be profitable. Now imagine that we can try the same thing on Polkadot. \n\n**UPDATE:**\n\nI like the idea with reward to the treasury based on benefits made by collection! By making this collection on Polkadot (although I can make it easier on Solana or Ethereum) I wish specifically Polkadot ecosystem will win from this!\n\nTherefore, by creating a collection, I will be happy to create additional activity in the network, bring new users and fees from all transactions that Polkadot will receive.\n\nIt's worth remembering that just participating in this vote will provide a retroactive reward in the future in the form of a priority minting spot. And it's Polkadot users who get this, not Solana and Ethereum, which is where my marketing will be.\n\nBut I can increase the benefits for the Polkadot ecosystem from the launch of my nft collection. If I learn the technical aspect of how I could guarantee profit for the treasury, I would definitely come up with a reward system. For example, 1/10 of the collected funds from minting could potentially go to the Polkadot treasury. But I need to find out if this is possible and how I can do it better from a technical point of view.\n\nDo not forget that I will not be able to allocate too much of a reward, since a lot of funds will have to go to salaries and utilities. I believe that the development of my nft collections in the long term will be better for the ecosystem as a whole than just a cash return. Since the better and more interesting the utility is, the more attention from other ecosystems I can focus on my collection, which will be based directly on Polkadot thanks to PVM.\n\nThe art:\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/SXcQ6gKF/image.png)\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/392mzY58/image.png)\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/sp9DLkQW/image.png)\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/8nxFQgnf/image.png)\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/B5RjyrJL/image.png)\n\n![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/LdR9C8NM/image.png)",

Then people realized that Solana is better not only in minting NFT's, but also in minting meme coins. Imagine how many people Solana has absorbed from Ethereum, how many people have migrated to Solana from Ethereum. It was Solana season — the influx of users was colossal, and following the hype, developers came. No one was afraid that building here might not be profitable.

          "content": "I have cooperated with talanted atrist who has worked for Nickelodeon to bring the first full fledged NFT collection right on Polkadot. \n\nThe first full fledged NFT collection on Polkadot\n\nThe first fully unique art collection — 10,000 pieces 1/1 on Polkadot.\n\n  \n  \n**Why do I think we need it:**\n\nFirst of all — the PVM that will be developed and delivered soon (Q2) can significally expand the utility of DOT token. For now — token utilities are very poor for the average retail user, it is intended more for developers (Governance, Staking and Coretime). In my vision, by creating such islands of activity like my NFT collection, we can increase the usability of DOT.\n\nGovernance, Staking and Coretime the main functions of DOT token. Do we need to expand it? I believe — yes! Let's add functionality for average retail users too, let them have some fun here, because as I said before, current functions of DOT token is not really about fun, about building. \n\nI don’t want to say whether this is good or bad, I would prefer to say that we need to remember that the majority in our space are average users. \n\nWe have been building for a long time, people from other chains even saying that Polkadot was built by builders for builders. So let's attract retail to our platform, let them study our blockchain by using it. This will show them the advantages of Polkadot over any other blockchain better than any advertising. The real experience > any form of advertising.\n\nMy NFT collection is just a small piece of puzzle of what we will provide to people with PVM. I believe that other builders and enthusiasts will expand the functionality of the DOT token by creating more activities on chain. By the way — more activity —> more transactions —> more fees to the treasury.\n\nBesides, by attracting many new users to our ecosystem we will also increase healthy competition among developers (we already have a lot of parachains/rollups, but we can have even more) in the race for each user. I think that this is exactly how Polkadot game change season can be started - first new users will come because they are attracted by something interesting, for example minting nft, then they will see that their experience is no worse than on Solana. The transaction speed is the same, the cost of transactions is cheaper than on Ethereum, so the user will like his experience, he will go to check the apps and rollups available on Polkadot among which there are many useful bridges, protocols, defi, depin, rwa, etc.\n\n**Why me and my foundraising:**\n\nI worked in many projects during NFT boom in 2021-2023. I have a lot of experience:\n\nCollabed with a lot of huge influencers such as @beeple ([https://x.com/beeple](https://x.com/beeple)) — 825k followers, @deekaymotion ([https://x.com/deekaymotion](https://x.com/deekaymotion)) — 225k followers.   \n  \nThe largest project that I managed is Lunar Project ([https://magiceden.io/marketplace/lunar](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/lunar)) — 10k NFT's sold, 2,000,000$ raised, 3,500,000$ trading volume (1 week).\n\nMy connections and my experience will be very needed in my strategy is to use not only Polkadot audience, but to go beyond our ecosystem and attract the attention of those who were not familiar with the Polkadot ecosystem before — SOL and ETH users. I would like to show them that our chain can work smoothly, quickly and cheaply. Although Solana has the last two advantages, for ETH users they may seem very significant (remember that the most popular gaming ecosystem MYTH was migrated to Polkadot because of this).\n\nI think that a good start can become a trend, and many more creators and even just artists will want to do the same — create their own NFT collections or other onchain activities.\n\n**Why I made this request:**\n\n— I am creating a symbolic request for 1000 DOT to use in initial marketing (discord + twtter page, promo throught the SOL and ETH communities), as well as for another main purpose - to find out how many people support my idea and whether the Polkadot community wants the appearance of a project of this format at all.\n\n— Form the very first project audience from those who voted (no matter NAY or AYE), giving them a priority place in the future minting process (WL spots — all voters will be able to mint first and cheaper).\n\nAll other costs (including salaries, game development, art and other promo) will be covered personally by me, not by the Polkadot treasury.\n\n**About my future NFT collection:**\n\nThe art is a collaboration between the artist and AI. There will be 10,000 images(near to 10,000 new polkadot holders). I am going to create an NFT collection using PVM, one way or another it will work directly on the Polkadot chain (or on Polkadot Hub), not on the parachains. \n\nThe minting will be through a contract, for the first time.\n\nMany may mistakenly think that the NFT trend has lost popularity and passed, but look at MYTH — projects with gamified utilities are still working and are still very popular. Therefore, my collection will be supplemented with a simulation game in which 10,000 autonomous AI agents will interact with each other in the world. \n\nBasicly, each holder of my collection will be able to spectate their own agent (the one they minted). General supply of the collection will be deflationary, some NFTs will be burned at some point, due to the fact that one character will be able to, for example, fight with another — we don't know how AI will behave himself, but each NFT's will have unique traits of character traits. Because of this, the value of some NFT's will gradually increase. Along with the attention that will be received thanks to the continuous stream on YouTube of the world in which all the characters will exist.\n\nAll donations from streaming on YouTube (and not only donations) will make up the prize pool in DOT, which NFT owners will earn for staking. If you stake your NFT, you earn, but you also have a chance to lose your character forever.\n\nThe uniqueness of the project is that each art is completely unique 1/1. This has not been in any collection on Ethereum or Solana. It will appear on Polkadot for the first time.\n\nIn summary we have AI generated art in combine with AI utility, and that's all secured by Polkadot.\n\n**Just a short story:**\n\nI started my journey in crypto by minting NFT's on Ethereum blockchain.

      "content": "It’s Goku.\n\nThis is my third solo creator tip request for my contribution and impact over the last ~5 months (140 days). The latest one was on October 11, 2024 (for 15K USDT).\n\nAside from memeposting, my content has typically involved extensive cross-ecosystem research, narrative-building, and positioning Polkadot and telling its story in the most intellectually honest way possible—often by touching on other ecosystem solutions and how they relate to Polkadot.\n\nFor tone, I generally target an audience outside of Polkadot, making the content digestible, engaging, and debunking the noise. I avoid preaching or a didactic style, instead mixing insights with a bit of entertainment to push Polkadot’s real value proposition and its contrarian bet.\n\nOver the past 140 days, my content on X has reached over 1.1M views and gained over 900 new followers—organically, steady, and quality over quantity way.\n\nThese posts have been leveraged by KOLs, Polkadot ecosystem projects, the community, and other content creators, creating further conversations and engagement.\n\nNow, with Kaito’s mindshare, smart follower, and yap points metrics, we have additional ways to assess impact on X. No metric tells the full story, but it provides some signal nevertheless. The current leaderboard still has farmers, but once adjusted, it will reflect a more accurate measure of influence in the X space. Even in its current form, if you check the 6-month or 12-month range, you’ll find me around the top 15 zone. While that’s not extremely high, I have one of the highest yap points among active Polkadot agents on X, which serves as a soft indicator of attention-grabbing on broader topics with crypto X inner circles—which is exactly where I focus.\n\nSome highlights from this period:  \n  \n**Polkadot Deep Dives & Comparisons:**  \n[Polkadot in 786 words](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1874088419736846530)  \n[Crypto governance (Ethereum vs. Polkadot)](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1891949981495595064)   \n[Parity hack → OpenGov](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1893668314389397637)   \n[Nomt → Polkadot](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1894124945178792085)  \n[Polkadot’s bullish case & messaging overview](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1886809755622236200)  \n[Polkadot in 2025](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1874475379747938622)  \n[Demystifying TPS & what it really means for Polkadot](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1861143060601806921)  \n[Revisiting Spammening & addressing misconceptions](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1888356808764326385)  \n[Kusama focus](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1892985921173078238)  \n[Kaito + Polkadot’s mindshare](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1890138771623923786)  \n[JAM Doom](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1895490079159632220)  \n  \n**Graphics, Short Bangers, Memes, Debunking:  \n**\n\n[Polkadot vs. Cardano’s 1M TPS event](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1864329638916345885)  \n[Remastered not so scientific chart of JAM positioning (close to Gav’s view)](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1892544540063453443)  \n[Polkadot’s roadmap](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1860701862481248336)  \n[JAM](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1873006877761798592)  \n[Polkadot’s roadmap—meme version](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1868036737311838364)  \n[Spammening event](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1864366404943729038)  \n[Everything Polkadot](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1859647961346736327)   \n[Ethereum in Polkadot](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1886888928516702577)   \n[Hydration, Solana, Polkadot](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1882482515237323043)  \n[Polkadot’s messaging breakdown](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1888327448330481975)   \n[Ethereum rollback & Gav’s take](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1893082975048212557)  \n[Ethereum becoming Polkadot](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1884593310460695005)  \n[One DOT at a time](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1887976330417115164)  \n[ETHDenver](https://x.com/0xgoku_/status/1895500739281363382)  \n  \nAnd many more.\n\nPotential FAQs:  \n**Have I ever been compensated for my content, taken sponsorships, or applied for funding?**  \nNo.\n\n**Marketing Bounty or Kaito?**  \nMarketing bounty doesn't do retroactive tips and not meant for requests of this size.

With this I could increase my involvement and contribution to Polkadot media significantly, so I suggest the community to evaluate whether my already made contribution and the one I am going to make in the next 3 months is commensurate with the requested reward or not.\n\nIf YES — which I very much hope, I will be able to spend the next 3 months implementing my further media plans. Which of course, although not to a significant extent, will still help Polkadot. As for me, this is now more relevant than ever in connection with the current market conditions. \n\nIf NOT — instead of full-time work for Polkadot I will have to change my focus to my WEB2 work, and reduce my contribution to Polkadot media.\n\nSo i just want to check if the community willing to provide me full time job for the next 3 months so I can give more Polkadot Media or not.\n\n**☑️ From September to Now:**\n\n-   I hit 450K views.\n-   Introduced Polkadot ecosystem (including parachains) to large influencers (YouTube + TikTok + Discord + Telegram) with large crypto communities in Russian-speaking regions.\n    \n\n**▶️ Since Now till February:**\n\n-   Show on the famous Russian-language YouTube crypto [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@KirillEvans) (500k followers) \"Haters against Polkadot\" where I will answer uncomfortable questions about Polkadot and dispel myths. _Expected views: ~50K-100K._\n    \n-   TikTok podcasts with average audience and views of ~10K-20K.\n    \n-   20+ more hype posts in my style + engages.\n\n**Few Highlights of This Period:**\n\n[Delicious Polkadot Staking](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1842953247583039649)\n\n[Polkadot Season](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1845234891971244477)\n\n[Polkadot Zombies](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1846951136797851791)\n\n[Cores Purchases](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1848386967869784512)\n\n[Polkadot Emotional Background](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1852056047269347675)\n\n[Coretime is Dead 💀](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1854208089073070164)\n\n[Polkadot + Cardano Friendship](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1856778459139146232)\n\n[Just a smal prophet meme](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1860812099825410133)\n\n[One more meme](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1861527686491099566)\n\n[Stay Bullish](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1859711811978756564)\n\n[Retail choose — Polkadot](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1857950925521858702)\n\n[OpenGov = Hesoyam cheat code](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1860812099825410133)\n\n[Why Polkadot > Ethereum](https://x.com/judashegemony/status/1862346043557306641)\n\nIn addition to this, I am really involved in many russian-speaking communities on different social networks such as TikTok, YouTube, Discord and Telegram and help learn Polkadot and why it can be and should be choice of anyone. There were a lot of jokes that I am a ambassador because I often brought up topics about Polkadot.\n\nPlease note that it is very important for me to show polite behavior, even in the most difficult situations. With my behavior and the style of my posts, I intend to make people feel like they are talking to a pleasant and very erudite person. And what kind of person, such are the projects he chooses.\n\nMy content is different from Goku, his content focused on the technical side of Polkadot, which is really necessary for Polkadot - to explain how it works in a popular way. \n\nMy content has less technical explanations about how Polkadot works, instead it has more of a supportive, mass-positive nature, which is necessary or not you will decide. \n\nIf you are honest, you will confirm that 3 months ago the atmosphere around Polkadot was not as positive as it is now. In many ways, the mood is dictated by the price, but it was important that positive content around Polkadot appeared as often in the news feed as around other hype projects. We are no worse, and thanks to frequent positive posts, many people got more faith, many did not sell and stayed with us. Emotions are a very powerful thing, especially in crypto and especially in a bear market.\n\n**Q&A**\n\nQuestion: How can we trust that job is not done yet will be also done in terms?\n\nAnswer: You do not need to trust, I ask for a tip only for the work already done. Because it would be unfair to get guaranteed money for an unguaranteed results. As an example I used [first Goku proposal](referenda/569?tab=description) where he asked 900 DOT for 6 months of work, so i just divided that number by 2. Work for the next 3 months I inserted to acquaint you with my further plans, which may influence your decision on this proposal. Like you, I am a Polkadot enthusiast, even though I am planning to dedicate 6 months in the end, I still ask for a symbolic payment, because thanks to it I will really be able to do useful things. \n\nThis is truly my desire to prove myself in this ecosystem and I will be grateful to you - the community for the opportunity given to me. You will literally grow and inspire talent (me) with the government tool. And yes, I am indeed limited by the need to receive a salary (from web2 work or web3), as are many of you. \n\nI am deeply aware of the community's reluctance to spend resources on unofficial (unpaid) ambassadors, and I know for sure that there are people who do this mission better than me, but recent market conditions (the upcoming altseason requiring a full mobilization of all the noise the community has) and leaving my web2 job gave me the idea to use one of the utilities of owning a DOT token — create this treasury proposal.\n\n\"Funding such people is not necessary, but it promises us benefits more than loses. By encouraging such talents as this guy, we motivate them to new highs.\" — Goku.",

Part of my research will focus on a DAO not only in theory, but mostly in practice as my long term goal (2 years) with Pluto Framework is to have a working EU compliant open source framework for building polkadot native mobile applications. I have also formed the Polkadot BD TG chat where core of Polkadot growing BD coordinates their efforts.  \n  \nAs part of my university research I plan to form a DAO. Its name will be Bohemia Fam.

This support will enable us to continue expanding our efforts to advance the ecosystem's maturity.\n\nThe latest public update with a summary of the next steps we are working on can be found in this short [forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/suggestion-to-improve-bounties-visibility-and-transparency-on-polkadot-by-saimon/9619/6).

Main content pages, along with those expected to see increased traffic, will also be refreshed to boost relevance and visibility. |\n| **Sub0 Reset** | As was done with the last editions of **[Sub0](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-sub0/)** and [**Decoded**](https://dablock.com/web3-events/polkadot-decoded/), all the talks, their summaries and related resources will be available on the new polkadotecosystem.com portal derived from the current dablock.com. Remember that If any speaker wishes to send us directly their slides or additional materials from their presentation, they can email them to contact@dablock.com. In any case, they will be able to modify and update any details on GitHub once the project migration is complete. |\n\nWith this support, in addition to completing the portal's migration and it expansion, our main mission is to keep increasing the visibility and accessibility of its resources. Answers to any possible questions and explanations for all the changes and additions made to the project over the past year can be found in this [odyssey and report till mid July](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17bN2-Xesp2Yv9qIbyvVrk7UaB5Jh_rC_OFjhZ0cuNTc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThanks for reading.",

We acknowledge that our initial proposal may have been overly ambitious in attempting to address multiple tasks and areas simultaneously, which led to some delays. We remain just as ambitious, but we are committed to progressing step by step.\n\n**Request for Support**\n\nAfter nearly a year and 1,000 on-chain governance events, we are again seeking direct support for the proposal _#1240_. This support will enable us to continue expanding our efforts to advance the ecosystem's maturity.\n\nThe latest public update with a summary of the next steps we are working on can be found in this short forum post. From now on, all updates will be easily accessible from the organization's GitHub and its project roadmap view.\n\nWe are asking for **8,400 USDC** to sustain and continue advancing our work on this phase.\n\nOver the next two months the following tasks will be further developed and delivered:\n\n100% Open-Source Migration\n\nTech: the Dablock portal is being migrated from the current CMS to a Static Site Generator solution (Astro), ensuring the entire platform is 100% open-source and fully manageable along with its content from a public GitHub repository, following a similar approach to the Polkadot Wiki.\n\nDomain: Along with this change, the portal will also be migrated to the polkadotecosystem.com domain, so that it is easier to identify and is disassociated directly from the identity of Dablock as such.\n\nTimeline: The migration of the portal to its first functional version is expected to be completed between early and mid-November, with ongoing development and expansion planned in the following months. \n\nMulti-Language Version\n\nA multi-language version will be introduced, enabling the publication of content in multiple languages beyond English.\n\nContext: We’ve observed a significant number of articles from Dablock being translated and shared, especially those based on talks from major ecosystem events. While these translations are often linked back to the original sources, they are published across various blogs without consistent organization.\n\nSolution: This update will enable everyone to publish the translations directly on a central ecosystem managed portal, enhancing navigation and resource accessibility.\n\nPortal Restructuring\n\nThe portal structure will be reorganized to prevent the generation of URLs with duplicate content, solving derivative problems, optimizing for SEO, and improving overall user navigation. A key task will be merging posts derived from talks at recent events like Sub0 and Decoded with the related directory profiles they reference—whether they are projects, initiatives/DAOs, or glossary entries.\n\nContext: The publication of content derived from event talks has resulted in the creation of URLs with duplicate content, which has negatively impacted the original portal's organic growth in SERPs. This restructuring and merging of content will address the issue from the beginning in the new deployment.\n\nDirectory & Content Updates\n\nAll directories will be updated with new information and elements. Main content pages, along with those expected to see increased traffic, will also be refreshed to boost relevance and visibility.\n\nSub0 Reset\n\nAs was done with the last editions of Sub0 and Decoded, all the talks, their summaries and related resources will be available on the new polkadotecosystem.com portal derived from the current dablock.com. Remember that If any speaker wishes to send us directly their slides or additional materials from their presentation, they can email them to contact@dablock.com. In any case, they will be able to modify and update any details on GitHub once the project migration is complete.\n\nWith this support, in addition to completing the portal's migration and it expansion, our main mission is to keep increasing the visibility and accessibility of its resources. Answers to any possible questions and explanations for all the changes and additions made to the project over the past year can be found in this odyssey and report till mid July.\n\nThanks for reading.",

          "content": "At DaBlock, we’ve focused on creating a detailed information portal for the Polkadot ecosystem, aiming to provide easy access to valuable resources. Key areas of focus include DApps, major initiatives and organizations, as well as insights from flagship events like Sub0 and Decoded.\n\nIt serves as a well-rounded and current information hub for the ecosystem, aiming to complement the Polkadot Wiki by emphasizing the key elements rather than the technical concepts.\n\nBackground\n\nAll of this officially began with the proposal #240, which, among many other tasks (complete report November 2023 — July 2024), has generated two notable and distinct outputs to highlight:\n\ndablock.com\n\nThis is the most comprehensive and curated ecosystem portal, featuring over 600 well-defined and structured URLs of mostly atemporal content. In its first months, the portal received approximately 12,900 views from more than 4,000 users, with a notable increase in activity over the last two months.\n\nDOT Brain\n\nThis is the most extensive raw directory of ecosystem elements, with more than 1,000 curated and categorized items. Management of this directory and related documents will transition to GitHub and be integrated into a monorepo alongside the new ecosystem portal.\n\nThe impact of these resources extends beyond individual users. Creators, agencies, and media teams within the ecosystem are leveraging this content as a valuable reference. These resources can significantly reduce the time required for content generation, making them useful for updating other major ecosystem portals as well as external platforms.\n\nFor teams, bounty curators, DAOs, or anyone needing assistance, feel free to reach out to me at: lv@dablock.com\n\nInitiative Development Report\n\nA detailed report on the development process and experiences is available here. This document may serve at least as a curious/interesting reading for indie projects seeking to establish themselves in the Polkadot ecosystem, sharing valuable lessons and challenges encountered. Additional perspectives can also be found in this forum post.\n\nWe have decided not to request the final 25% retroactive payment for proposal #240, initially intended for completion upon delivering all tasks.

      "title": "Retroactive Big Tipper Proposal  - Research and analysis of the Polkadot Ecosystem AI-tools Usage for Treasury Proposal Processing",
      "content": "Greetings Polkadot Community,  \n  \nI am submitting this Big Tipper proposal for Polkadot Ecosystem AI-tools Implementation Analysis as a part of the development and enhancement of the Web3 Funding Assistant. This project focuses on collecting, processing, and presenting valuable information about current funding and grant options for the Web3 ecosystem, and providing a framework to assist developers in navigating the funding landscape and helping them get their ideas funded.\n\n**Objectives of the proposal research**\n\n1.  Find and test all AI-tools integrated into the Polkadot ecosystem related to Ecosystem Funding Options Navigation, Proposal Writing, Proposal Reviewing, etc.\n2.  Understand and summarize individual experience of using the presented toolset with critical analysis on the impact to the ecosystem.\n3.  Collect the Polkadot ecosystem documentations and data sources relevant to web3 grant\\\\proposal assistance cases.\n4.  Prepare Polkadot ecosystem documents, configure Custom GPT actions and test with Polkadot Ecosystem data.\n5.  Understand the technical complexity of the Polkadot ecosystem data integration to the next version of the product and allocate corresponding tasks for the project sake.\n\n**Impact for Polkadot Ecosystem**\n\nWe researched how the Polkadot community integrated the new tech of AI into the ecosystem and we are glad that Polkadot is one of the first web3 ecosystems starters in active integration of AI-power, however we see that this technology is used to limited extent and its potential can further leverage by the community for growth and prosperity.   \n  \n**Current status of AI-tools leverage in Polkadot ecosystem**\n\nWe have found a successful implementation of the educational hub powered by Polkadot.AI ([https://polkabot.ai/)](https://polkabot.ai/\\)) which was also funded through the community funding mechanism. Started as a discussion ([https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/761)](../treasury/761\\)) and then supported as Treasury Proposal ([https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/617).](../referenda/617\\).)  \n  \nWe also discovered that the OpenGov proposal profile page now has an Open AI summarization tool (see the screenshot below) helping to faster understand a proposal with summarized outlined parameters such as Problem Statement & Audience, Significance, Proposed Solution, Expected Outcomes.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/HxsZTZF/Open-AI-proposal-summary-feature.png)\n\n  \nAnd community discussion summarization tool (see the screenshot below).\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Wpkh04N/Comments-Summary-Feature.png)\n\nWe also have found that there have been a few other discussions highlighting still existing issues with the proposal creating and review process making our research even more significant and important for Polkadot ecosystem health improvement.  \n  \n_AI-Powered Tool for Efficient Paper Reading on Polkadot: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2420,](2420,) [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2400](2400)_\n\n_Enhancing User Experience with an Intelligent Ecosystem Assistant Proposal: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/1109](../referenda/1109)_\n\n_ChatGPT integration with Polkadot proposals to improve governance: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1760](1760)_\n\n_AI powered plug-in for Polkadot developers that reduces development time: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2391](2391)_\n\nThe biggest problem for reviewers is that they have to spend a lot of time reviewing and sorting proposals, so even such cool features as the Batch Voting (see the screenshot) can not solve it to the full extent.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/sRWvZ3F/Batch-Vote-Feature.png)\n\n**  \nSummary on the Polkadot ecosystem AI-tools usage**\n\nAll of the above still justifies the existing problem and that the approaches and tools applied before have not, unfortunately, solved it completely. The current implementation of AI-tools helps to get educated about the whole ecosystem or get summarization on the proposals which present the very basic use case of the technology. Summarization is definitely the next step to streamline the process or proposal approval with the help of AI as it allows to sort valid / invalid proposals faster, however real evaluation of a proposal still requires an in-depth reading, domain understanding and thorough check on the proposed solutions and requested reward.\n\n**How do we solve the long existing problem?**  \nHaving experience and knowledge in developing AI-based semantic analysis tools for investment insight and in decentralized infrastructure products, having explored the problem from different angles for more than 6 years we came up with a solution we are ready to bring to the whole web3 ecosystem.\n\nWe incorporate the power of blockchain and AI\\\\ML best practices into a single solution delivering a totally new value which is designed to increase crypto foundation communities efficiency 10 fold leading to an immense growth of innovation development.\n\nWe implement institutional investment data analysis approaches and insights helping web3 ecosystems omit ages of mistakes and risks already tested and validated by the industry experts and now automatically performed and executed by Artificial Intellegince. Reasoning, Scoring and Agentic are the words hiding the secret source behind the poduct we are developing. \n\nWe also got in touch with OpenGovAssist who initiated a research on crafting and completing successful treasury proposals back in August 2023 ([https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1825)](1825\\)) and waiting for their reaction or future collaboration and experience exchange.  \n  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/WVj9f81/Open-Gov-Assist-Active-Research-On-The-Topic.png)\n\n**  \nJobs done**\n\n1.  In-depth research on the Polkadot AI-tools implementation and current state\n2.  In-depth investigation on the Polkadot ecosystem funding options\n3.  Collected relevant documentations and links relevant to web3 grant\\\\proposal assistance cases\n4.  Prepared Polkadot ecosystem documents, configuring Custom GPT actions and testing\n5.

We share this fact to add more trust to the project and the proposal as we are able to provide evidence of such agreements in private on request.  \n  \n\n**Boris Boarman Custom GPT:** [https://chatgpt.com/g/g-INnHdqajG-boris-boarman](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-INnHdqajG-boris-boarman)\n\n**Link to Boris Boarman Landing Page:** [https://whatdahack.is/boris-boarman/](https://whatdahack.is/boris-boarman/)\n\n**Link to Boris Boarman GitHub:** [https://github.com/imboogieman/Boris-Boarman](https://github.com/imboogieman/Boris-Boarman)  \n  \n\n_N.B.: Doing research and interviewing potential users of the product we often found that many people do not understand that the Custom GPT built on Open AI infrastructure is **NOT** the product we are developing, but it is just a prototype to demonstrate the basic use cases implemented by AI. However, even now with Boris Boarman Custom GPT any builder will significantly reduce efforts on making another proposal for the Polkadot Treasury._\n\n_The product (Boris Boarman Web3 Grant Assistant) will be presented as a standalone dApp. So we want to highlight one more time that the provided link to Boris Boarman Custom GPT does not represent the product we envision.

      "title": "Tip for 4+ Years of Phunky Polkadot Activism",
      "content": "My fellow Polkadot agents:\n\nI am requesting a tip of 1000 DOT for the last 4+ years of ecosystem activism and engagement. I will do my best to enumerate my history and provide examples across that time in an effort to demonstrate my ongoing commitment to the ecosystem and my fellow agents.\n\nBrief Timeline:\n\n- During the summer of 2020, I began researching blockchain projects that I believed would be good investments, and I was immediately drawn to the promise of Polkadot due to the legacy of Gavin Wood and his vision of interoperability. This was when I stumbled upon my first YouTube video, **What Is Polkadot?** featuring Bill Laboon and Dan Reecer. I shared this video with family and friends on Facebook (cannot provide links as evidence, as I haven’t signed in for so long I’ve effectively been locked out of my account), and joined a burgeoning Facebook group where people were talking about Polkadot exclusively.\n\n- Fall / Winter 2020, I continue to accumulate DOT, watch more videos–including Web3 Foundation’s **Blockchain Fundamentals** MOOC taught by Bill Laboon. I also shared this series with family and friends who wanted to learn more about blockchain technology. \n\n- January 2021, I started my Twitter / X account “The Phunky One” (a riff on my original AOL screen name from 1995, “PhunkySid”) to start sharing my excitement for / love of Polkadot. During the first half of that year, I begin constantly interacting with others who were deeply interested in the ecosystem including GldCalf, LeemoXD, Alice_und_Bob, MoonBearer, YungBeef, effectively forming the proto-ChaosDAO on the Twitter timeline.\n\n- July 2021, I was invited to join ChaosDAO, but had to ask what a Discord server was at the time (lol)\n\n- For the following year, I became a Singular NFT junkie who supported and promoted artists working in the ecosystem. As a former educator, I found this new technology incredibly interesting, especially due to its ability to support and sustain artists via this new medium.\n\n- Winter 2021/2022, I excitedly deployed the vast majority of my smol DOT stack into crowdloans for teams I wanted to support and leave the rest staked.\n\n- October 2022, I was DMed by David Chapman (aka “KBL”) and asked if I had ever considered working full time in the Web3 industry. About a week later I had a fateful meeting with him alongside Rich “Shorty” Shorten, a Discord lurker who called me out for NOT being the oldest “grandpa” in ChaosDAO about a year earlier. He was also one of the co-founders of Lucky Friday, and I was hired shortly thereafter to become the Director of Fellowship and Protocol Relations, making me the second employee of the company.\n\n- November 2022, I officially started my job and made my first appearance on AAG with Jay and Leemo in my first week (Episode #9, November 7th 2022). My role as a regular panelist has evolved over that time to include the “State of the Phunk” and being the official timekeeper. Barring travel conflicts, I have been on close to 95% of the episodes and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future, especially should Lucky Friday continue its role as DVs.\n\n- Summer 2023, I applied to be a speaker at Polkadot Decoded to provide a presentation on Teddy DAO, but was not selected. Undeterred by this decision, [I recorded my own Polkadot Decoded talk and posted it on Twitter](https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1673373045342322695), and then hosted the first ever Polkadot Decoded watch party for the Tampa Bay region here in Florida. I have also applied to speak about Teddy DAO and Polkadot at ETH Denver every year, and will continue to do so until I have been accepted.\n\n- Winter 2023, I was tapped by Chris Wade (aka Learn Polkadot) to join him for a meeting with Andrew Stallings to help discuss and strategize a ref to potentially fund Conor Daly’s sponsorship by the Polkadot community. I attended regular meetings with his team and helped orchestrate a lot of things behind the scenes until it came to fruition.\n\n- Summer 2024, Lucky Friday was officially selected to receive a DV role, and I continue lead point on the entire initiative, from coordinating the setup of the bot in our server, creating the growing OpenGov public forum on TG, posting all voting notifications to proponents of referenda, gather and summarize commentary from fellow team members to provide detailed feedback, etc. All told, since June of this year, AAG and OpenGov duties have occupied at least 25% of my time each week.\n\nFor many months on AAG and in online forums we have discussed the need for spending stables and using the tipping function to “put DOT in the hands of good ecosystem agents.” We also talk a lot about the importance of social reputation in the ecosystem, and though my contributions have not been technical in nature, I have tried my best to provide value in a number of other ways and I hope that this brief timeline of activity above demonstrates that in a succinct way. \n\nThank you in advance for your consideration in this matter, and I hope you will consider supporting me with your AYE vote as much as I have supported the Polkadot ecosystem over the last 4+ years.\n\nGratefully,\n\nRyan / Phunky\n",

      "content": "Dear Polkadot Community, dear friends,\n\nI'm writing again to request your support for my ongoing efforts to contribute to the Polkadot ecosystem. Over the past eight months, I've been actively involved in research, news dissemination, community engagement, and governance discussions. My goal has been to foster a more informed and engaged Polkadot community.\n\n**Organic Growth and Impact February/August 2024:**\n\nThrough consistent and organic efforts, I've achieved the following results on my X account:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/t8cCHXs/1000000463.png)\n\nThese results demonstrate my commitment to growing the Polkadot community and encouraging active participation in OpenGov. It's important to note that these numbers are entirely organic, achieved without the use of bots or any other artificial means.\n\n**Why Decentralized Voting Matters:**\n\nTrue decentralized governance requires significant participation from both users and tokens. Limited participation can lead to decisions that reflect the interests of a few rather than the collective will of the community.\n\n**Request for Support:**\n\nTo sustain my efforts, I'm requesting a tip of 1000 DOT. This is a modest amount compared to the total DOT discussed in our community and is intended to support my ongoing contributions.\n\n**Staking Commitment:**\n\nIf approved, I pledge to stake the entire **1000 DOT** for a minimum of 12 months, further demonstrating my long-term commitment to Polkadot.\n\n**Call to Action:**\n\nWith your support, I can continue to expand my efforts and contribute even more to the Polkadot community. Together, we can create a more informed, engaged, and decentralized Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nThank you for your consideration.",

          "content": "**Dear Polkadot Community,**\n\nAfter the successful completion of our initial project phase funded by Referendum 352 on Kusama, I am excited to present the next step for the **Polkadot OpenGov Observer** initiative. Over the past six months, we have made significant progress in enhancing community engagement with Polkadot governance, and now I am seeking a second round of funding totaling **1000 DOT ($4,300 USD)** to further our impact and expand our offerings.\n\n### **Project Overview and Achievements:**\n\nThe **Polkadot OpenGov Observer** was created to foster community engagement by providing real-time updates and comprehensive monthly overviews of OpenGov activities, treasury allocations, and voter behavior on social platforms such as Twitter.\n\nSince launching the first phase, we have achieved the following:\n\n-   **Increased Community Engagement**: The Twitter bots have reached over **168 and 127 followers** respectively, with a steady rise in interactions on posts related to OpenGov activities. This has significantly boosted community awareness and involvement in governance matters.\n\n### **Work in Progress and Future Enhancements:**\n\nWith the requested funding, we aim to continue developing the project and introduce several new features that will enhance its utility:\n\n1.  **Delegate Voting Updates**: The new version of the Twitter bots will showcase delegate votes, including those from prominent entities such as Saxemberg, Chaos DAO, Polkassembly, Polkadot Maxico, BRA-16, Lucky Friday, The Kusama NFTxCM, and many others. This feature will provide valuable insights into how influential delegates are voting on key proposals.\n    \n2.  **Pinned Posts for Monthly Treasury and Governance Stats**: We will introduce pinned posts that offer a clear and concise overview of treasury holdings in DOT, USDT, USDC, and other tokens, as well as governance statistics. This will help community members easily track and understand the financial health and governance activities within the ecosystem.\n    \n3.  **On-Chain Identity Migration Updates**: Due to the recent migration of on-chain identities to People’s Chain, many identities are not currently displayed. We will modify our code to accurately reflect on-chain identities of voters, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n    \n4.  **Monthly Delegate Voting Activity Graphs**: We will provide bar graph representations of the voting activity of key delegates such as Saxemberg, Chaos DAO, Polkassembly, Polkadot Maxico, BRA-16, Lucky Friday, The Kusama NFTxCM, and others. This visual representation will make it easier for community members to follow delegate behavior and understand voting trends.\n    \n\n### **Requested Funding:**\n\n-   **1000 DOT ($4,300 USD)**\n\n**Funding Breakdown:**\n\n-   **Total work hours: 200**\n-   **Hourly rate: $21**\n-   **Including server cost**\n-   **Total amount: $4,300**\n\n### **Mission and Future Impact:**\n\nOur mission remains to drive greater adoption of Polkadot OpenGov by making it more accessible and engaging for all community members. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a participation rate of **40% of DOT holders** in governance activities, which will help ensure more informed and fair decision-making within the ecosystem.\n\nBy developing new features and refining our existing tools, we aim to establish the **OpenGov Observer Bots** as the central hub for all governance-related activities on Twitter.

      "title": "Polkadot India IIT Roorkee Workshops and Hackathon (1/5)",
      "content": "# **TL;DR**\n\nThis is the first edition of a series aiming to build a developer community in India for the Polkadot ecosystem from the ground up by hosting in-campus workshops and hackathons in the leading [IIT universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology), which are known worldwide for producing the largest number of leading developers. IITs have a vast untapped talent pool that needs to be curated through a well-defined path of learning, knowledge exchange, and a competition. We are looking to establish the path through this 3-in-1 event, which features workshops for accelerated learning, the foundation of students' collective for a series of tech & non-tech activities, and the final hackathon.\n\n# **Why not events bounty?**\n\nWe did apply for the events bounty twice, but the curators denied our initial and refined proposals because of reasons mentioned, like a limit on the number of organizing members involved, their misunderstanding of the review rating with a star rating for one of the cheapest accommodations, etc. We will post a detailed thread on our experience with the events bounty, especially the curators’ lack of thorough research later as our priority is the successful hosting of this 3-in-1 event in one of the best universities for which getting another approval (letter of intent) won’t be easy.\n\nDue to the two-week delay caused by the events bounty, we are forced to post multiple big tippers, as a small spender could take significant time. We need about 15k USD out of our total requested amount to make the necessary reservations/bookings (partial token amount wherever possible). So we are looking to post four big tippers and one small spender for the same. Upon approval of the first big tipper, we will encode the rest of the proposals and proceed with the bookings.\n\n# **Overview**\n\nWe are excited to propose a first-of-its-kind hackathon and workshop for the Polkadot ecosystem in India, organized by [**Blockseblock**](https://blockseblock.com/) in collaboration with Edgetributors SubDAO. This event aims to foster innovation, development, and community engagement within the Polkadot ecosystem by bringing together talented developers, students, and blockchain enthusiasts. The fundamental propositions of this event are as follows:\n\n-   Hybrid structure: We will host the workshop and the hackathon two weeks apart, giving students time to review all the materials and the learning curve. Throughout this two-week period, we will guide/assist them virtually by forming a students’ collective.\n-   Importance of IITs: IITs are often referred to as talent hubs in India due to their challenging entrance barrier for students and for well-known student activities like fests, workshops, hackathons, etc. Hosting this hybrid event in an IIT will attract enthusiastic students from the nearby universities as well.\n-   Blockseblock's prior hackathon hosting experience, along with the technical curation/expertise of Edgetributors SubDAO contributors, will ensure that the event is not only successful but also impactful.\n-   Being the first of this kind of collaboration, we focus on keeping this event budget-friendly yet accessible for everyone. We will implement our learnings in future hackathons across different IITs.\n\n# **Problem:**\n\n**Limited Developer Awareness:** There's a significant lack of awareness about PolkadotSDK and Substrate within the Indian developer community.\n\n**Ineffective Meetups:** Standard meetups often fail to capture the attention of developers from India's crowded IT sector.\n\n**Tech Exposure Gaps:** For Indian engineering students, significant-tech exposure typically occurs only within their universities or nearby IITs.\n\n**Campus Placement Culture:** The prevalent campus placement culture in India means students often only explore opportunities with companies that visit their campuses, missing out on the vast opportunities offered by Web3.\n\n**Lagging Behind Competitors:** The Polkadot ecosystem lags behind competitors in hosting student-specific learning events like workshops in the Indian demographic.\n\n# **Solutions:**\n\n**Hackathon at a Leading IIT:** Organize a high-impact hackathon at a top IIT to attract and engage talented developers.\n\n**Pre-Hackathon Workshops:** Conduct workshops before the hackathon to build foundational knowledge and excitement around PolkadotSDK/Substrate.\n\n**Formation of a Students' Collective:** Establish a students' collective to foster continuous engagement, collaboration, and learning within the Polkadot ecosystem. This will be crucial to the team formation and other activities after hosting the workshops, before the start of the hackathon.\n\n## **What's success?**\n\n-   We expect 100-150 participants for the Workshops and Hackathon with at least 20-30 quality project submissions.\n-   Formation of the collective that can feature the Polkadot Ecosystem in the IIT Roorkee, acting as a self-sustainable incubator/space for the new age developers.\n-   This hybrid event aims at enhancing the visibility of the Polkadot ecosystem from the foundational level by cultivating more developers which will contribute to the natural growth and demand.\n\n# **Event Details:**\n\n## **Venue: IIT Roorkee**\n\nIIT Roorkee, one of India’s premier engineering institutions, offers an inspiring and technologically advanced environment. Known for its rich history and commitment to excellence in education and research, IIT Roorkee is the perfect venue to host a hackathon aimed at driving innovation in the blockchain space.\n\n## **Letter Of Intent:**\n\n[IIT Roorkee LOI.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dKFRczlxmQJv7N5kRNyOIC2fxCANR3A_/view?usp=sharing)\n\n## **Timeline**\n\nThe workshops will be scheduled for **September 26th and 27th**, providing participants ample time and resources to prepare for the hackathon. The hackathon will commence on **October 11th** and conclude on **October 13th**.\n\n**1\\. Pre-Hackathon in-campus offline Workshops (26th Sep - 27th Sep):**\n\n-   Introduction to Polkadot: Introducing Polkadot’s history, architecture, key features, and ecosystem.\n-   Technical Deep Dives: Workshops on building with Substrate/Polkadot-SDK, ink!, XCM’s cross-chain interoperability, and parachains/solochains.\n-   Hackathon Preparation: Guidance on hackathon best practices, tools, and resources available for participants.\n\n**2\\. Activities for the students’ collective (28th Sep - 10th Oct):**\n\n-   Online bingobaker activity for different tech/non-tech tasks.

      "title": "Support for Investigative Work and Communication Initiatives in Polkadot",
      "content": "Dear Polkadot Community,\n\nI am seeking your support for my ongoing work in investigation, news dissemination, meme creation, community communications, and active participation in discussions across various groups. Over the past eight months, from January to August 2024, I have dedicated myself to enhancing engagement within our community and promoting awareness only about Polkadot and its governance system.\n\nAchievements and Impact:\n\nDuring this period, I have successfully contributed to the following metrics on my account on X:\n\nTotal Visualizations: 1,920,971\n\nTotal Interactions: 100,125\n\nBookmarks: 751\n\nNew Followers: 1,779\n\nResponses: 3,633\n\nReposts: 4,010\n\nVideo Visualizations: 148,369\n\nContent Visualizations: 155,643\n\nThese statistics highlight my commitment to not only informing the community about the latest news and developments within Polkadot but also engaging and encouraging more individuals to participate actively in OpenGov voting. By addressing critical issues, proposing constructive ideas, and sharing intriguing insights about our voting system, I strive to attract a diverse audience and increase participation in our governance processes.\n\nThe Importance of Decentralized Voting:\n\nIt is essential to recognize that the true essence of decentralized voting can only be realized when we achieve a significant turnout of both participants and tokens. If participation remains limited to a small circle of individuals, the decisions made may reflect the interests of a select few rather than the collective will of the entire community. To ensure that our governance is genuinely representative, we must strive for higher engagement and mobilize our community to take part in shaping the future of Polkadot.\n\nTip Request:\n\nTo support these initiatives, I am requesting a tip of 888 DOT. This amount represents only a small fraction of the total DOT discussed in our community, much of which has often been allocated without receiving adequate feedback on past proposals.\n\nCall to Action:\n\nWith your support, I can continue to enhance my efforts in fostering a vibrant and informed Polkadot community. Together, we can empower more citizens to engage in meaningful discussions and take part in shaping the future of Polkadot through active voting in OpenGov.  \n  \n  \n\nDear estemeed HAs, DVs and Whales:\n\nI understand that some of you may be inclined to vote NAY on my proposal, and I respect your perspective. It is crucial to acknowledge the necessity of protecting our ecosystem from proposals that could be detrimental to the wallets of our investors, the reputation of Polkadot, and the passion of our community members.\n\nHowever, we are witnessing an increasing number of proposals that seem more focused on marketing rather than on meaningful development for our ecosystem. This trend is concerning and must be addressed. One effective way to discourage such requests is to bring to light the names and often absurd demands made by these individuals, sharing them with the broader audience on platforms like X. By doing so, we can deter such behavior and encourage a more constructive approach to proposals that genuinely benefit Polkadot and its community.\n\nI hold deep admiration for the work and time you dedicate to addressing the daily matters of Polkadot. Yet, it is essential that we confront the reality of our situation. The issue at hand is not solely about individuals like myself or others who strive to shed light on the facts that can hinder investor confidence in our remarkable technology. It is about fostering a community that prioritizes integrity and genuine development.\n\nThank you for considering this perspective as we navigate these challenges together.",

We hope the community will appreciate this.\n\nWe believe the **value** generated is big, not only for the Parity smart contract team, but also for anyone else planning to work on solidity based tooling for Polkadot in the future.\n\n## Full report can be find here: \nhttps://hackmd.io/@T6Wf5EsOQKe-6wyPjJPtuw/Bk_A8RYPC\n\nAnd we are adding for free also additional text which is placing smart contracts in Polkadot into the Plaza/Asset hub context: https://hackmd.io/@T6Wf5EsOQKe-6wyPjJPtuw/HkC2lL2dR\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/azxwOYS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/d7rvXG3.png)\n\n\n## The inspiration \nfor applying tis tip came from the discussion with Alex from Parity smart contract team, who agrees, this work has been needed and should be fairly compensated.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5OGHASk.jpeg)\n\n## Thank you\nto the community for recognizing our work on this research and we hope you agree we created value for the ecosystem's future smart contract story on AssetHub/Plaza.\n\n",

      "content": "Dear members of the Polkadot community,\n\nI am requesting a tip for conducting **the experiment with  beer bar at the Polkadot Decoded 2024**\n\n**Description of the experiment:**\nDuring the Polkadot Decoded 2024 event, the **Robonomics Team** organized and conducted an experiment aimed at measuring different readings from sensors around the [**Free Beer Stand from ChaosDAO**](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/821). The team wanted to see how many people attended and how interested they were in the bar. As part of the experiment, the Robonomics team placed a set of various sensors around the Free Beer Stand from ChaosDAO and was able to assess the bar's load.\n\n**Importance of the experiment:**\n\nThe Robonomics team aimed to demonstrate to the Polkadot community a new futuristic and technological method of automatic data collection. Since Robonomics is part of the Polkadot ecosystem, it can use this method to store data in the web3 cloud and provide it to OpenGov. **If the Polkadot community is interested in such event reports, the Robonomics team is ready to continue doing such things in the future.** The obtained results for current or future events can help the community better understand the interest in events organized through the Polkadot treasury, and provide organizers of these events with a more accurate report of the work done.\n\n**Requested amount:**\nBased on the work done and the significance of the results obtained, I request a tip of 550 DOT.\n\n**Attached materials:**\n\n- Article on the results of the work done - https://robonomics.network/blog/beer-bar-decoded2024/\n- Twitter post - https://x.com/nakata5321/status/1814337841259851789?t=TQCCDmbStIZt5FUjfRcd7Q&s=19\n\nThank you in advance for your attention to my request, and I hope for a positive decision.\n\nNakata, engineer in Robonomics network",

      "content": "Dear community, Thank you for your assistance in helping to close and refund the deposit associated with the Governance 1.0 proposal. This is a Treasury proposal under Gov 1. It was our first time applying for a proposal on OpenGov, but due to a lack of experience, we mistakenly followed the Gov 1 process, which resulted in the proposal being in an incorrect state, with 500 DOT locked within it. The incorrect proposal can be found here: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/452 In the https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/treasury, you can view the status of our proposal. Subsequently, we applied for the proposal using the correct method, and it was approved: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/202 Finally, we successfully submitted the content and achieved all the objectives of the proposal. It would be great to receive a refund of this deposit, just as the community has done in similar cases. This would be fair and conclude this matter. The proposal aims to refund 500 DOT to the Polkadot Ecology Research Institute (149FXUmHgg75z4sk2LzFDyctNLHhzf2YxGMFHT7TakkbeQ7F) for my original proposal. Thank you for your support.",

      "content": "LiteScan is a lightweight indexer for Polkadot chains which empowers anyone to run their own indexer in minutes and enjoy privacy, independence or cost savings\n\nLiteScan was developed by Piero ([pifragile](https://github.com/pifragile)) over the past few months. It uses MongoDB to store data of blocks, extrinsics and events and works out of the box for Polkadot and its parachains. The idea for the indexer came when [Encointer](https://encointer.org/) was in need for blockchain data to power its [accounting backend](https://github.com/encointer/accounting-backend) and its app and other indexer solutions became cumbersome to maintain.\nSince then, Encointer is using LiteScan in production, it took us about 15 minutes to get it up and running.\n\nIf you need to quickly retrieve and store blockchain data of Polkadot or one of its parachains, without any setup, this indexer is for you.\n\nAlong with the indexer itself, LiteScan comes with an easy to use Docker setup to run and test the indexer. Please find the code and documentation below.\n\n> **_Repo:_** [https://github.com/pifragile/litescan](https://github.com/pifragile/litescan)\n\ntry it out! you'll be indexing in minutes!\n\nWe propose a tip of 868 DOT to retroactivley support the development of LiteScan.",

No guide of this size and quality existed before. This video is especially important and useful for all ecosystem agents responsible for creating and managing bounties. The tutorial extensively explains the progress and logic behind the bounties and their execution methods through multi-signature accounts. It is professionally split into lessons that are easy to navigate and communicate related features with instructive demonstrations, examples, and even small quizzes.\n\nIt will save bounty curators and other multisig managers countless hours.\n\nTo help propagate it, we have embedded it into the OpenGov.Watch guides section [here](https://www.opengov.watch/guides/bounties_multisigs) and will keep suggesting it to future users.\n\nThis proposal is also a signal vote to reward ecosystem agents like Adam who put in countless hours to help others, educate, and provide support.

We refrained from rushing for the top up initially, prioritizing the completion of development.\n\nView proposal [#541 here](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/541).\n\nThank you.\n",

Therefore, in this second edition, it took place in Puebla at the Museo el Barroco, along with a side event organized by Unlocksummit collaborators.\n\nFour ambassadors participated in this event. Two of us gave talks at the side event on May 23, and three ambassadors conducted the workshop at the main event at the Museo el Barroco.\n\nThe expenses for Polkadot's participation in the event were covered by the four ambassadors. Therefore, it was an opportunity to expand and represent Polkadot at other technology and web3-related events. Usually, the organized events are in the same cities, and participating in these events gives us the chance to expand and continue growing the Polkadot community in Mexico, while also attracting new people interested in using the tools provided by the ecosystem.\n\nLink to the full [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CSPsqwXBXhcricjUBhP6PcLeyy3KvMHi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115533531626513740712&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\nLink to [expenses with receipts and invoices](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dRGbeXWVPFXR1TVCuZJJOP13-5YWIM-H/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115533531626513740712&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n",

João's multifaceted roles demonstrate his commitment to advancing blockchain technology and nurturing an informed Portuguese speaking community.\n\n**2 - The motivation for this proposal:**\n\nCommunication through digital media channels has become one of the most effective ways to reach and influence vast audiences in the modern era. My Youtube channel, João Hazim, and the community Zero Paralelo, has made its mark by producing high-quality, impactful content for the Portuguese community about Polkadot and other blockchain ecosystems. However, to continue expanding and enhancing our reach, we require funding. Here are the reasons why investing in our channel is essential.\n\nEducational: Funding will enable us to expand my educational content, which is designed to inform and engage both beginners and advanced users. This investment will facilitate the creation of comprehensive tutorials, deep dives, and case studies that enhance user understanding and adoption of blockchain technologies in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nTeam Expansion and Enhancement: With this support, I will be able to assemble and expand a dedicated team of professionals, which is crucial for the production and quality of the educational content.

We are seeking funds to cover the automated payout for these validators over a 30-day period.\n\n\n**Benefits to the Community:**\n\n```\nEnhanced User Experience: \nUsers will no longer need to manually claim their rewards.    \nThis automation will ensure that rewards are instantly visible in their accounts.\n\nInstant Compounding: \nAutomatically paying out rewards allows users to compound their rewards immediately, maximizing their earnings without delays.\n\nEfficiency and Transparency: \nStreamlining the payout process reduces the administrative overhead and makes the system more transparent and user-friendly.\n```\n\n**Funding Request:**\n\n```\nDaily Requirement: 29.7 DOT (297 validators * 0.1 DOT per validator)\nMonthly Requirement: 891 DOT (29.7 DOT per day * 30 days)\n```\n\nBy implementing this initiative, we aim to improve the overall experience for all Polkadot network participants, ensuring that they can effortlessly benefit from their staking activities.\n\n**Requested Amount: 891 DOT**\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. We believe it will significantly enhance the validator and user experience on the Polkadot network.\n\n",

      "title": "Learn Polkadot Tip for Polkadot Brand Being Elevated by Conor Daly and Inter Miami",
      "content": "On December 29th, 2023, I received a DM from Chris, aka \"Learn Polkadot.\" He is the Head Ambassador of North America and was instrumental in helping me throw my first Polkadot Decoded watch party earlier in the year. He asked me if I would be interested in trying to bring the Indy 500 opportunity to our community, and I excitedly said yes.\n\nAfter many meetings with Andrew, Conor, and others, we finally got [Ref 514](514) live on chain. Then, after the treasury payout snafu, he helped Jay and I rally DOT token holders so that we could get the replacement [Ref 616](616) passed in record time to replace the funds and help make the race team whole in time for the race.\n\nAnd though I had no hand in the Inter Miami deal ([Ref 644](644)), I am genuinely impressed and exceedingly grateful that Chris helped orchestrate this deal as well. I ardently believe that both of these marketing opportunities will bring a lot of attention to our incredible ecosystem, something that I personally believe is sorely lacking here in the United States.\n\nAs far as I am aware, Chris has never received any tips from the treasury, and certainly not for spearheading these two incredible opportunities. Moreover, he has been a stalwart ecosystem agent by getting involved in the early years of the network. While he may not be the most public facing Polkadot promoter, it is amply evident that he has the chops to help pull important strings behind the scenes (let alone acting as our on-the-ground reporter the day of the Indycar reveal about a month ago).\n\nFor these reasons and many more, I hope that other DOT token holders will join me in celebrating these recent successes, as well as his prior contributions across many years, by voting AYE on this tip for \"Learn Polkadot.\"\n\nGratefully,\n\nRyan / Phunky  \n  \nP.S. — For Six or anyone else who needs a formal proposal written up, I've linked the document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15r-beQW4bIA6DM9-yG4CEyuJchz7at1cGcY7Hq-Y91I/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "content": "**Semi-Retroactive Proposal for the translation of the Polkadot Wiki to Hungarian**\n\n**Proponent:** [Polkadot Hungary Community](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/16DNbAdyy6QsTPdDDHL5gt7FaeAQ1UioJA6Pj7aUGJERveFd) Multisig Account\n\n**Beneficiary:** [Mildzsu](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/14V2ATewhYS7fGtjKEvfN1jHH78nKMBWbd6moRUrpqgHvkS6), Polkadot Ambassador Candidate / Polkadot Hungary team member\n\n**Date**: 04. 29. 2024\n\n**Requested value:** 490 DOT (calculated with 7 DOT/site)\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nAfter witnessing the success of the first Budapest Blockchain Community Week in spring 2024, it is evident that there is a growing interest among the Hungarian population in blockchain technology. Currently, the number of members in various Hungarian blockchain communities is estimated to be around 200,000, including investors, developers, and enthusiasts.\n\nWe recognize the need for educational materials in the local language, as we believe language barriers should not hinder the adoption of this technology. Our goal is to provide resources that enable individuals to become knowledgeable users, thereby fostering a vibrant and engaged community within Hungary. Therefore, we propose translating the Polkadot wiki into Hungarian, divided into multiple milestones. The current proposal is only created for the first milestone (Hungarian translation of the Explore section of the wiki), and we will continue the work based on the experiences of how the community welcomes it, as well as the amount of effort required to finalize each section.\n\n**What is Polkadot Hungary?**\n\nThe Hungarian Polkadot community was founded in 2020, by Six, the regional Head Ambassador and has been steadily growing in numbers and expertise. During this time, the Hungarian community has hosted more than [30 Polkadot Meetups](https://www.meetup.com/polkadot-hungary/), organized two Hackathons ([Polkadot Championship](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/hackers-wanted-for-polkadots-36k-metaverse-championship-anyone-welcome)), and [Polkadot Day](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1imy7VkY6iV34co-BqWLkm2_MqF4q7FCn) was the most attended event with more than 130 attendees during the Budapest Blockchain Week, selling out quickly, and we represented at several conferences and participated in several Substrate and community-based projects and incubated them. The Hungarian community has its own Staking Pool (Nomination Pool ID: 219) and actively participates in Polkadot's on-chain governance system, OpenGov.\n\nToday the Polkadot Hungary team is organized into specialized working groups based on members' interests and expertise. These groups focus on translating content, including the Polkadot wiki, designing a website for the Polkadot Hungary community to share articles (and eventually the wiki), and coordinating events while producing Hungarian-language content.\n\nThe Polkadot community in Hungary is experiencing continuous growth. Currently, the [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/polkadot-hungary/) boasts over 430 members, with monthly meetups regularly organized, drawing an average of 20-30 participants per event. Furthermore, we maintain an active [Telegram group](https://t.me/polkadothungary) and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0d-2y00kxiydKTWABgyg9g), the most watched video about Polkadot reached 800 views. It clearly demonstrate the existing demand and interest in Polkadot-related knowledge.\n\nTo ensure easier access to information about Polkadot, while acknowledging the importance of English proficiency to a certain extent, we recognize the necessity for a proper translation of the Polkadot wiki into Hungarian.\n\n**Our proposal**\n\nThe Polkadot Hungary organizer team is proposing a translation of the Polkadot wiki to Hungarian. The translation will include articles, visuals and in later milestones, potentially other supporting documentation as well.\n\n**Why This Translation is Beneficial for the Polkadot Community?**\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem continues to expand, the importance of translating a wholesome documentation, such as the wiki, into local languages escalates. The Spanish community has already published the Spanish wiki version, which demonstrated that there is a need for such support to expand the community and make the technology more approachable. The translation of the Polkadot wiki is not just about language conversion; it is about making the rich and complex world of Polkadot more accessible to a diverse audience world wide.\n\nAs in Hungary, there is a lack of educational content related to Polkadot, by translating this extensive Wikipedia content into Hungarian, we are directly addressing this gap. The Polkadot Hungary team is committed to promoting Polkadot in Hungary by providing high-quality, localized content. The translated wiki will serve as a valuable resource for both new and existing Polkadot users in Hungary, ultimately contributing to the global success of Polkadot.\n\n**Workflow and expected deadlines**\n\nThe translation, proofreading, and graphic design work will be carried out in consecutive phases to ensure the highest quality and accuracy.\n\n1.  **Translation:** During the translation phase, the original English text will be translated into Hungarian. Given the technical and specialized nature of the text, the quality of translation is paramount, and this phase is the most time-consuming. Estimation of full completion: approximately 6-8 months. Note, that the finished sections and pages will be released on a continuous basis, not all at once at the end of the process.\n    \n2.  **Proofreading:** After the translation, the text is proofread to ensure its correctness, comprehension, and coherence. Proofreading will happen simultaneously in batches. Final completion is estimated one month after the completion of the translation.\n    \n3.  **Graphic Design:** Graphic elements associated with the translated and proofread text will also be created to support the documentation. This phase will take about 1-2 months, and will happen simultaneously as well during the translation process This timeline is informational and the exact duration of the work may vary depending on the complexity of the project and other factors.\n    \n\n**Proposed milestones and funding request**\n\nDue to the nature of the technical documentation, and as each section includes information from various knowledge areas, we have to make sure the translations are correct, both linguistically and factually.\n\nWe are planning to break down the work into 4 main milestones based on the main Wiki:\n\n-   **Milestone 1:** Explore (26 articles)\n-   **Milestone 2:** Learn (134 articles) - Note: this section due to its size may be broken into multiple subsections with separate proposals.\n-   **Milestone 3:** Build (15 articles)\n-   **Milestone 4.:** Maintain (22 articles)\n\n**Requested amount**\n\nThe current proposal is only created for the first milestone (**Hungarian translation of the Explore section of the wiki**), and we will continue our work based on the experiences of how the community welcomes it, as well as the amount of effort required to finalize each section.\n\n-   Translation services: 294 DOT (by Mildzsu)\n-   Proofreading and editing services: 196 DOT (by Zsófi Major)\n\n**Total: 490 DOT** (calculated with 7 DOT/site)\n\n(The integration of the Hungarian text into the wiki website (work in progress) will be available in the Website Development proposal later this year.)\n\nThe work on Milestone 1 (Explore) is expected to be finished in 1 month after approval of the proposal. The finished wiki will be available on [polkadothungary.net](https://www.polkadothungary.net/) website, which is under development\\*.\n\n**\\*Until the website development is finished, the wiki will be available through a Google doc. [See the link here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cJ7pm-MD1QNMay0rvKksnh_mFulHgQIMJb2ywjw_WN8/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Follow up and future milestones**\n\nAfter successful completion of the translation, our team will follow up with a thorough report about how long the work was, what were our challenges and how the process can be improved for later work. We are going to create our future milestone proposals based on these findings.\n\n  \n**The team members who translating the Polkadot Wiki:**\n\n**Mildzsu:**\n\nMildzsu has been a cryptocurrency investor since 2016. He has been an administrator of many Hungarian cryptocurrency communities, enjoys managing communities, and participating in daily communication. His passion for Polkadot has been present since the beginning of the coin. As he got to know Polkadot and Substrate technology better, he delved deeper into the ecosystem. This is how he first got in touch with six, Gabo, Vikk, and Zsófi. He has been a member of the Polkadot Hungary team since autumn of 2023. Also, in the autumn of 2023, he received the Candidate status and during the 3-month period, he demonstrated numerous contributions. On January 16, 2024, he submitted the Polkadot Ambassador submission and contribution document. ([https://bit.ly/mildzsu)](https://bit.ly/mildzsu\\)) His motivation within the Polkadot Hungary team is nothing but to support the Polkadot community globally, especially in Hungary.\n\n**Zsófi Major:**\n\nZsófi Major joined the Polkadot community in 2022 and ever since the beginning she has been focusing on engaging developers in the ecosystem. As member of the Developer Relations team at Parity, she has worked on various projects, programs (e.g. the **Polkadot Developer Heroes program**), hackathons (including the Polkadot Global Series North America 2022, and various community organized hackathons, such as the Polkadot Championships, etc), and other initiatives aimed at supporting the onboarding and learning experience for those interested in building on Polkadot and its ecosystem. Since her tenure has ended at Parity, she has been more actively involved in the community side of todos, and as her education and past experiences were focusing on communication and media, she is excited to support the Polkadot Hungary community with easy to understand content in local language.\n\n**Link to further information to the original proposal: [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8WdCuQcaXgt8rjBHMMJRD8rmDSQ3tAq5Cnbvj7yaEY/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n**Leave your comment below or reach out the Team on the Polkadot Wiki Translations Hungarian TG channel: [LINK](https://t.me/+Pk8phI9mnTQ5ZTY0)**",

      "title": "Retroactive Funding Request for PolkadotPrague 2023 Marketing Costs",
      "content": "Summary:\n---\nGlazescape, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting the Polkadot ecosystem through community-driven events, is seeking retroactive funding from the Polkadot Treasury to cover essential marketing costs incurred during the organization of PolkadotPrague 2023. Despite the event's success, the Events Bounty did not cover these costs, stating they were out of scope. This proposal aims to secure the necessary funds to alleviate the financial burden on the organizing team and ensure the sustainability of future Polkadot events.\n\n**[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-u6hok6HEad1ew6yecN1VPNot7roipdBsObOy1I0-s)**\n\nKey Points:\n---\n1. PolkadotPrague 2023, held on June 5-6, was a highly successful event that showcased the Polkadot ecosystem and brought together community members, developers, and industry leaders.\n2. The Glazescape team undertook crucial marketing initiatives, including collaborations with Lunar Strategy for PR, and targeted Facebook and Twitter ads to drive event awareness and attendance.\n3. The Events Bounty did not cover these marketing costs, deeming them out of scope, placing a financial burden on the organizing team.\n4. Retroactive funding from the Treasury will demonstrate Polkadot's commitment to supporting ecosystem growth, encourage future event organizers, and strengthen the relationship between the Treasury and the community.\n\nBudget:\n---\nThe total requested amount is $5,162, including a 10% buffer. The breakdown of the costs is as follows:\n\n| Task                 | Amount | Status    |\n|----------------------|--------|-----------|\n| PR by Lunar Strategy | $3,000 | Delivered |\n| Facebook Ads         | $982   | Delivered |\n| Twitter Ads          | $711   | Delivered |\n| 10% Buffer           | $469   | Returned if unused |\n| **TOTAL**       | **$5162**   |  |\n\nWhy this proposal did not go through the Events or Marketing Bounty:\nThe Glazescape team engaged in discussions with the Events Bounty and Marketing Bounty administrators to explore alternative funding options for the marketing costs. However, the bounty administrators stated that these costs were not within the scope of the bounty. The consensus was that a retroactive Treasury proposal would be the most appropriate course of action to secure the necessary funds.\n\nThe Polkadot community can access the full PolkadotPrague 2023 report, including event details, media coverage, and advertising campaign results, to evaluate the event's success and the importance of the marketing initiatives in driving that success.\n\nBy approving this retroactive funding request, the Polkadot community will not only support the Glazescape team in their efforts to promote the ecosystem but also set a precedent for the Treasury to back essential marketing initiatives that contribute to the success of Polkadot events.\n\n- **[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-u6hok6HEad1ew6yecN1VPNot7roipdBsObOy1I0-s)**\n- **[Event report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mYsJxCy2cHyPrAE57qgXfTaXysqtDyz8_ja5UflYo5U)**",

A special place is given to the standards proposed by RMRK.\n\nIt also teaches how to create, buy and sell NFTs and teaches about different marketplaces in the ecosystem and how to use them.\n\nThen different use cases are shown, which aim to inspire the reader to work on an idea and take it to the web3, whether in business or in art.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the book contains links to different web3 projects, as well as images and diagrams designed to provide a better understanding of the concepts.\nYou will also find a complement of videos symbolised by QR codes with which you can complement the reading.\n\n\nMy idea is to give these books as gifts in Chile and Latin America, in schools and universities.\nIn the complete proposal is the detail and the budget corresponds to 1000 DOT.\n\nOne more thing, I have printed some units and every time I go to a place I leave them on a table.

      "content": "****Total requested:** 889 DOT**\n\nWe would like to request a self-tip in regards to the maintenance and continued development of our services on decentraDOT.com of the past couple of months, this includes;\n\n\n**1. Validator dashboard Cyclops ([dashboard.decentradot.com](https://dashboard.decentradot.com))**\n\nCyclops is an open-source validator dashboard we developed over a year ago (https://github.com/ArthurHoeke/cyclops). The first version was released on Apr 13, 2023. Since the initial release we have self-hosted an instance of our dashboard for the community and provided maintenance and development where needed for over a year since the initial w3f grant. Currently, the dashboard is actively used by over 100 validators. Since the release we have added nomination pools, reward export tools, nominator tracking among other changes.\n\n**2. Thousand validator program leaderboard ([1kv.decentradot.com](https://1kv.decentradot.com))**\n\nWe have developed, maintained and self-hosted a 1kv leaderboard for about 2 years, providing program participants with an easy interface to track their position in the program.\n\n**3. Polkadot validator selector tool ([decentradot.com/polkadot-validator-selector/](https://decentradot.com/polkadot-validator-selector/))**\n\nAfter seeing that other Polkadot validator selector tools aren't available / maintained anymore, we developed a new unbiased selector tool a few weeks ago which is now also listed in the Polkadot wiki (https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-staking).\n\nThe tool takes variables into consideration such as verified identity, commission, active status, skin in the game et cetera helping users make educated decisions when selecting validators to stake with.\n\n**4. Polkadot guides blog ([guides.decentradot.com](https://guides.decentradot.com))**\n\nWe provide an actively updated guides blog on Polkadot, providing users with easy to understand tutorials on topics including liquid staking, pools, compounding and more.\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXcoVYLHBVyBUBGvcYxczmr7rsd31ER2QZNWw3RjjpuQJ)\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmerinMyHFEvaE4kAHH3UEYJmugCv8byB6druht6Zb7naK)\n\nThe requested tip would help us cover most of the server costs, maintenance and development hours we put in the tools outlined above. Taking into consideration a $100 hourly wage:\n\n<ins>Validator dashboard Cyclops:</ins>\nAdditional development (pool support, nomination tracking etc) and hosting / maintenance: $2500\n\n<ins>Thousand validator program leaderboard:</ins>\nInitial development and hosting / maintenance over the past 2 years: $1000\n\n<ins>Polkadot validator selector tool:</ins>\nInitial development and maintenance: $2000\n\n<ins>Polkadot guides blog:</ins>\nDevelopment of platform and writing of articles: $500\n\nTotal: $6000 / $6.75 (Per DOT on Apr 14) = 889 DOT.\n\nIf you have any questions please let us know, thank you.",

      "title": "Retroactive Tip for Portuguese Content Creation",
      "content": "Just one month ago, I presented [a proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/575) to OpenGov that unfortunately did not receive approval. However, setbacks are not synonymous with defeat, and my dedication to this project remains unwavering.\n\nAfter careful consideration and valuable feedback from within our community and other stakeholders, I have refined my approach. I am pleased to present a revised proposal, now with a sole focus on retroactive content.\n\nThis strategic shift allows our community to engage more deeply with the milestones we've achieved and the content we've already produced. Despite the initial setback, progress has not halted. In fact, we have already delivered one-third of the content outlined in the original proposal.\n\nThis demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement and our ability to adapt to feedback. Our content pipeline has remained active, ensuring that our audience receives valuable insights and information consistently from the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nFurthermore, this proposal also aims to promote Polkadot on social media, specifically on Twitter, by subscribing to the account [Polkadot Brasil](https://twitter.com/polkadot_brasil) on X Premium and sponsoring posts to expand the profile's reach. It's important to highlight that this profile on X is the main account for the Brazilian Polkadot community on this social media platform. It is linked to the main Telegram group that welcomes all Brazilians entering the ecosystem. All references and respected voices, such as senior ambassadors, former heads, content creators, and OGs from the Brazilian community, are present and can be found [here](https://t.me/Polkadot_Brasil/1).\n\nTaking into account the latest projects approved for Brazil ([1](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/568), [2](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/508)) and the upcoming events in the ecosystem over the next months, such as agile coretime, airdrops, memecoins, GameFi, RWA, etc., this proposal will bring benefits to the Polkadot business in Brazil by maintaining this channel active and more reliable.\n\nI've been managing the Polkadot Brasil profile since early Q3’23, consistently fostering an engaged community. I'm proud to say that my efforts were recognized within the first three months when I received a [small tip by Kusama governance](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/298). Over the past five months, despite limited resources, I've remained dedicated to enriching the profile with original content and facilitating discussions for Portuguese speakers about Polkadot.\n\n**Who am I?**\n\nHello, I am [Uai so serious?](https://twitter.com/anarchychains), an ambassador for Nodle Network deeply involved in the Polkadot Brasil ecosystem for three years. I have actively participated in Polkadot Sub0 events in both 2022 and 2023. Additionally, I am the founder of [blockaffee](https://twitter.com/blockaffee), a web3 podcast that delivers weekly episodes featuring interviews with ecosystem builders. I also serve as the editor and host of [Modular News](https://open.spotify.com/show/1sMJmLWe9TvRrsY9XQ7j6F?si=424f34c755e54795), a daily crypto news podcast in Portuguese.\n\n**In the last five months, we have:**\n\n- Hosted 5 Spaces (average audience of 283 listeners/spaces)\n- Partnered with SubWallet for translating the crowdloans unlocking campaign ([batch 1](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1715745016247619828?s=20) and [batch 2](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1745098311714193827?s=20))\n- Actively participated in other communities in spaces and calls\n- Published original threads ([1](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1745460682035011986), [2](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1768291093098160608), [3](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1776339037894435300), [4](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1777368932900344002), [5](https://x.com/anarchychains/status/1736038536309248343))\n- Increased our followers by over 300\n\n**In the next three months, we plan to:**\n\n- Host a minimum of 3 Spaces (one per month)\n- Publish original threads\n- Subscribe to X Premium annually\n- Sponsor posts to expand profile reach\n\nWe invite everyone to visit our profile page on [X](https://twitter.com/polkadot_brasil) and see for yourselves how we have been producing content with dedication and commitment, even without adequate resources. Now, we believe it's time to invest in this potential and enhance our engagement with tools and professionalism so that more Portuguese speakers have access to Polkadot information.\n\n**ROADMAP ~~MAR~~-APR-MAY**\n\n- Thematic Spaces on ~~DePIN~~, GameFi, and RWA (one per month)\n- Pre-space thematic threads discussing the current state of the ecosystem in these sectors (~~DePIN~~, GameFi, and AppChains)\n- Posts explaining Polkadot Agile and updates tracking on Kusama\n- Surpassing the milestone of 1000 followers (almost there)\n\n**FINANCING**\n\nThis proposal requests a total of 550 DOT from the Polkadot treasury, allocated as follows:\n- 350 DOT for Uai (70 DOT per month for five retroactive months)\n- 200 DOT for X engagement (Premium and post advertising)\n\n**METRICS AND STATS (on the last 28 days, updated on 6th April)**\n\n- 944 followers\n- 27.9k impressions \n- Averaged tuned Spaces: 283\n- Engagement rate: 6.4%\n- Retweets without comments: 81\n- Likes: 724\n- Replies: 76\n\n**IMAGES**\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/Sr00cs7/12895-UAI-1713370200699.png)\nSee this post [here](https://x.com/derekyoo/status/1780508450318852285).\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/2qj7C9H/12895-UAI-1712845543058.png)\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/R6RSy61/12895-UAI-1712847672360.png) \nSee this post [here](https://x.com/diode_chain/status/1776054614099742999).\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/zndqLtq/12895-UAI-1712845927556.png) \nListen this Spaces [here](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1773108030055293229).\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/gMnL9sp/12895-UAI-1712846098780.png) \nListen this Spaces [here](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1760424595314622889).\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/SVbrHGc/12895-UAI-1712846675028.png) \nListen this Spaces [here](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1748723958398980534).\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/znFgkvT/12895-UAI-1712846940476.png) \nListen this Spaces [here](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1728413265686925765).\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/x6x75Hw/12895-UAI-1712847260442.png) \nListen this Spaces [here](https://x.com/polkadot_brasil/status/1718266489948565975).",

The inclusive approach targets schools, universities, social organizations, and street artists, removing economic barriers to democratize knowledge about NFTs. The proposal inspires future creators, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and empowers street artists to explore opportunities in the digital space. Collaboration with social organizations extends the reach to marginalized communities, while measuring local impact and establishing sustainable educational partnerships. The proposal seeks to catalyze a cultural shift towards the adoption and understanding of NFTs in Latin America within the Polkadot ecosystem.\"\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\n**1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\n\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**2. PROPOSAL**\n\n\nWe all agree here that the Polkadot ecosystem is the best, and we also agree that we need users, more users. \n\n\nTypically, efforts are focused on attracting developers from other ecosystems here, and that's fine, but I'm concerned about another group. All the people who are outside of web3. \n\n\nMy first focus will be Latin America. My work is based on providing knowledge to individuals to facilitate their onboarding to the web3 of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\n\nMy first proposal, which I will detail below, was about DeFi courses and a DeFi book on Polkadot. It \nhas worked very well.\n\n ![image](https://i.ibb.co/dKmkqBT/13228-MACZAM-1712456925492.png)\n\nAdditionally, I have written about other topics such as DeFi on Astar Network and NFTs on Polkadot. Both books are already finalized.\n\n ![image](https://i.ibb.co/6R76VbT/13228-MACZAM-1712456943547.png)\n\n\nThis proposal is about funding to give away the NFT book on Polkadot, in schools, universities, and to artists in Latin America, starting in Chile.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/mCJbxgR/13228-MACZAM-1712456958499.png)\n \nI will visit schools and universities and give away printed books, digital books, and NFT-format books, and I will take the message of the Polkadot ecosystem to the streets, classrooms, and groups of people who are not familiar with Polkadot. Attached are links to the mentioned books.\n\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/kq5mk8Q/13228-MACZAM-1712457174955.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n•\tHere is an example of a book written about DEFI on Astar Network. \nhttps://a.co/d/6dF8Jki\n\n\n•\tHere the Book Digital.\nhttps://a.co/d/3oi92Kw\n\n\n•\tHere is the index of the book\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1XZpwHzWBiTWPh2HJXg6PyuaTzcaFOImI/view?usp=sharing\n\n\n•\tAttached is a detailed budget for the entire proposal.\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_c1pf9tikxZjYDx2-Lj3KOHmNchEuPGA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114936309332560350563&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\n\n**In summary, 700 books will be delivered,**\n\n\n100 paper books\n\n100 digital books\n\n500 NFT books\n\n\n\n\n**3. PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES**\n\n\n•\tUniversal Educational Inclusion: Ensure widespread knowledge dissemination on NFTs in Polkadot by distributing the book in schools, universities, and social organizations.\n•\tAccess Democratization: Gift a substantial number of copies to ensure diverse communities, regardless of resources, have access to key information about NFTs in Polkadot.\n•\tInspiring Future Creators: Motivate young artists and creators to explore the potential of NFTs in Polkadot as a platform to showcase and monetize their art.\n•\tInterdisciplinary Collaborations: Stimulate collaboration across different disciplines by introducing NFTs in Polkadot within academic environments, fostering intersections between art, technology, and business.\n•\tEngaging with Social Organizations: Collaborate with social organizations to bring the book to marginalized communities, promoting educational and economic opportunities through understanding NFTs in Polkadot.\n•\tEmpowering Street Artists: Distribute the book among street artists to offer new perspectives on how they can leverage NFTs in Polkadot to expand their art and generate income.\n•\tPromoting Responsible Digital Culture: Educate students and communities on responsibility and ethics in the digital world, encouraging safe and conscious practices when engaging in the NFT space in Polkadot.\n•\tFacilitating Educational Events and Talks: Organize educational events, talks, and workshops in collaboration with schools, universities, and organizations to delve deeper into the topics presented in the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**4.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\n\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**2. PROPOSAL**\n\n\nWe all agree here that the Polkadot ecosystem is the best, and we also agree that we need users, more users. \n\n\nTypically, efforts are focused on attracting developers from other ecosystems here, and that's fine, but I'm concerned about another group.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\n\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**2.

The inclusive approach targets schools, universities, social organizations, and street artists, removing economic barriers to democratize knowledge about NFTs. The proposal inspires future creators, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and empowers street artists to explore opportunities in the digital space. Collaboration with social organizations extends the reach to marginalized communities, while measuring local impact and establishing sustainable educational partnerships. The proposal seeks to catalyze a cultural shift towards the adoption and understanding of NFTs in Latin America within the Polkadot ecosystem.\"\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\n**1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\n\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**2.

The inclusive approach targets schools, universities, social organizations, and street artists, removing economic barriers to democratize knowledge about NFTs. The proposal inspires future creators, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and empowers street artists to explore opportunities in the digital space. Collaboration with social organizations extends the reach to marginalized communities, while measuring local impact and establishing sustainable educational partnerships. The proposal seeks to catalyze a cultural shift towards the adoption and understanding of NFTs in Latin America within the Polkadot ecosystem.\"\n____________________________________________\n\n\n\n**1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\n\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n**2. PROPOSAL**\n\n\nWe all agree here that the Polkadot ecosystem is the best, and we also agree that we need users, more users. \n\n\nTypically, efforts are focused on attracting developers from other ecosystems here, and that's fine, but I'm concerned about another group. All the people who are outside of web3. \n\n\nMy first focus will be Latin America. My work is based on providing knowledge to individuals to facilitate their onboarding to the web3 of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\n\nMy first proposal, which I will detail below, was about DeFi courses and a DeFi book on Polkadot. It \nhas worked very well.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, I have written about other topics such as DeFi on Astar Network and NFTs on Polkadot. Both books are already finalized.\n\n \n\n\nThis proposal is about funding to give away the NFT book on Polkadot, in schools, universities, and to artists in Latin America, starting in Chile.\n\n\n \nI will visit schools and universities and give away printed books, digital books, and NFT-format books, and I will take the message of the Polkadot ecosystem to the streets, classrooms, and groups of people who are not familiar with Polkadot. Attached are links to the mentioned books.\n\n\nHere's an example of a book I've written about DEFI on Astar Network.\nAttached is a detailed budget proposal for the entire proposal.\n\n\n\n•\tHere is an example of a book written about DEFI on Astar Network. \n•\tHere the Book Digital.\n•\tHere is the index of the book\n•\tAttached is a detailed budget for the entire proposal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**3. PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES**\n\n\n•\tUniversal Educational Inclusion: Ensure widespread knowledge dissemination on NFTs in Polkadot by distributing the book in schools, universities, and social organizations.\n•\tAccess Democratization: Gift a substantial number of copies to ensure diverse communities, regardless of resources, have access to key information about NFTs in Polkadot.\n•\tInspiring Future Creators: Motivate young artists and creators to explore the potential of NFTs in Polkadot as a platform to showcase and monetize their art.\n•\tInterdisciplinary Collaborations: Stimulate collaboration across different disciplines by introducing NFTs in Polkadot within academic environments, fostering intersections between art, technology, and business.\n•\tEngaging with Social Organizations: Collaborate with social organizations to bring the book to marginalized communities, promoting educational and economic opportunities through understanding NFTs in Polkadot.\n•\tEmpowering Street Artists: Distribute the book among street artists to offer new perspectives on how they can leverage NFTs in Polkadot to expand their art and generate income.\n•\tPromoting Responsible Digital Culture: Educate students and communities on responsibility and ethics in the digital world, encouraging safe and conscious practices when engaging in the NFT space in Polkadot.\n•\tFacilitating Educational Events and Talks: Organize educational events, talks, and workshops in collaboration with schools, universities, and organizations to delve deeper into the topics presented in the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**4. WORK REPORT**\n\nA detailed report on the project's outcomes will be provided.\n\n\n**\n5. PRESUPUESTO TOTAL**\n\nTOTAL, 9.700 USD , ó 1000 DOT. (9,7 DOT/usd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**6. PROJECT LIDER**\n\nMacZam, a Chilean engineer with a master's in Finance and Investments, a Diploma in Cybersecurity, and 20 years of experience in the financial industry in Chile. MacZam has been a professor at various universities in Chile, currently teaching NFT classes in The Valley Chile's Metaverse Diploma, and DEFI classes in Lytryum Academy focusing on the Polkadot ecosystem. MacZam is the creator of the GreenBoard DEFI YouTube channel, part of WAG Media, and author of the first decentralized finance book with examples of DEFI protocols deployed on Astar Network, available on Amazon. \nMacZam is a former ambassador for Darwinia Network and Astar Network in Latin America.Network \n\n\nFor more information, click\n\nhttps://cl.linkedin.com/in/macariozamoranofuentes\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Criptomaczam1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@CriptoMacZam\n\nhttps://a.co/d/6dF8Jki\n\nhttps://a.co/d/3oi92Kw\n\nhttps://medium.com/@MacarioZamorano/dapp-staking-c26875b2038f\n\n\n\n\n**7. ABOUT MY PREVIOUS PROPOSAL**\n\nThe proposal consists of three stages. \nThe first stage has concluded. During the months of January, February, and March, the first free course on decentralized finance (DeFi) with a focus on the Polkadot ecosystem was conducted, covering key topics such as staking, liquid staking, swaps, AMM DEX, loans, yield aggregators, and reliable information sources. \n\n80 people from 9 countries, including Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Spain,... enrolled, and finally, 15 out of 80 students passed the final exam.\n \n\nIt has been a success. The report is attached here.\n",

      "title": "Retroactive Tip For Content Creator ",
      "content": "Following your valuable assistance and advice aimed at making the community more transparent, I now have a verified account. :-) for this new proposal after the suggestions you provide me with proposal number #608\n\n**Presentation:**\n\nI am here to request a tip as a content creator for the work done since 2021. I'm an youtuber and content creator **\"Il Marchese del crypto\"**.\n\nFor suggestions, please feel free to contact me here: @afilicudi\n\n\\-YT Channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8IK9iXowAXBhD-fZ2bM9NA/](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8IK9iXowAXBhD-fZ2bM9NA/)\n\n\\-Twitter: [https://twitter.com/MarcheseCrypto](https://twitter.com/MarcheseCrypto)\n\n\\-Telegram group: [https://t.me/+eKfCzCCVhfc4Zjc0](https://t.me/+eKfCzCCVhfc4Zjc0)\n\nI understand very well that not being actively involved in the international Polkadot community (although I always read), you probably don't know me. However, I believe that Polkadot's open gov was also created to allow people who contribute or have contributed \"from a distance\" to be known.\n\n**This is a correction of proposal #608 now placed in Unnote!** \n\nAs approved in other cases like proposal #486 by Csaint02 or proposal #569, I am requesting a tip for the many videos made on YouTube to introduce people to Polkadot and its entire ecosystem: (educational videos, comparative videos, explanatory videos, speculative videos, shorts, lives, etc.) **from 2021** \n\nFurthermore, I often provide continuous updates on Polkadot (but not only, I am independent and generalist) through in-depth news on both YouTube and my Telegram channel, also helping many people take their \"first steps\" in the Dot ecosystem and trying to make it as understandable as possible even for the less experienced.\n\nI believe I was the only one in Italy (or at least the first) to introduce people to Dot crowdloans, their functioning, how to participate, the use of Polkadot JS, Talisman wallet, platforms like Parallel, or even simply through exchanges for the inexperienced.\n\nAdditionally, educational videos such as \"the importance of leaving at least 1 dot in the wallet,\" how to stake, or how to participate through nomination pools.\n\nI have explained various projects from the ICO phase (like Centrifuge) to explaining projects like Acala, Astar Network, Manta, and Moonbeam.\n\nSimple comparisons of the functioning of the Polkadot blockchain compared to Cardano, or the difference between Kusama and Polkadot, etc…\n\nReturning to my request, it is truly very modest for all the study and work done to make Polkadot known, but I did it for free! However, given this opportunity, which I find very valid for those who have contributed to the growth of Polkadot within their means or competencies, I believe it is correct to make this small request!\n\nHere are some of the contents I have created over time on my channel, while it often happens to talk about Polkadot even when I participate on other YouTubers' channels as a guest.\n\n**Some creations:**\n\n[Tutorial on participating in crowdloans on Polkadot](https://youtu.be/W0uP4fp4wPE)\n\n[Explanation of Polkastarter's launchpad operation](https://youtu.be/Y-C1s19hvCA)\n\n[Comparison between Kusama and Polkadot](https://youtu.be/vIV0RxqMufw)\n\n[Funny prediction of Dot's price in 2021](https://youtu.be/N2XqquhT5-Y)\n\n[Using OKX to participate in Dot and Kusama auctions](https://youtu.be/ZNGMzeWKFaY)\n\n[Differences between Polkadot and Cardano](https://youtu.be/ROoqixT1O3s)\n\n[Videos and live streams dedicated to Dot auctions](https://youtube.com/shorts/dHP_LbroBGo)\n\n[Further exploration of auctions and project investment](https://youtu.be/AVO8QXQvtbs)\n\n[Polkadot parachains FAQ](https://youtu.be/mF_ZjDkGdwk)\n\n[Maximizing profits through Polkadot crowdloans](https://youtu.be/vq2lWt2i-0s)\n\n[Recap of initial auctions and winners](https://youtu.be/o3-mlaufczc)\n\n[Tutorial on the Talisman Wallet](https://youtu.be/g5IbVEaMDnQ)\n\n[Provocative discussion on \"Is Polkadot dead?\"](https://youtu.be/nv1gxH5TiNA)\n\n[Live Q&A sessions on Dot auctions](https://youtube.com/live/O7dsb0cMN40)\n\n[Live discussion with Luca Poggi, Italian Polkadot Admin, on \"Is Polkadot resurrecting? Polkadot 2.0\"](https://youtube.com/live/pvYStfehwXQ)\n\nYT shorts: ACALA on POLKADOT bonus on deposit and whitelist APPROVED: ([https://youtube.com/shorts/tt-\\_0VYpyGY)](https://youtube.com/shorts/tt-_0VYpyGY\\))\n\nBe careful not to go below 1 DOT : ([https://youtube.com/shorts/piD43aaKvmc)](https://youtube.com/shorts/piD43aaKvmc\\))\n\nI believe I have contributed, (not like Luca Poggi that him works night and day for Polkadot for Italian Community), but in my possibility, to the growth and awareness of the Polkadot community in Italy. I believe that 50% of my followers have investments in Dot or in some project related to it and many of them use Dapps on it.\n\nThank You Guys",

      "content": "This is a Large tip proposal for 0xTaylor's work supporting the free open-source Discord [Governance bot](https://github.com/ChaosDAO-org/InternalGov-2.0). Sixteen (16) application feature additions were tracked via ChaosDAO's [project tracker](https://github.com/orgs/ChaosDAO-org/projects/3) and completed back in September 2023.\n\nThe majority of these features were \"Quality of life\" that supported an improved experience for the user. For [example](https://i.imgur.com/eirTtan.png), HTML wasn't converted to markdown and thus ate up the majority of the 2000 characters Discord allows and was difficult to read. There were numerous other small issues with handling that markdown and escaping which I worked through to present a well formatted post that we see today. \n\nYou can see the full list of features completed below:\n![](https://i.imgur.com/1GinDi6.png)\n\nThis bot is also used by The Kusamarian and I as part of ChaosDAO advocate for other DAO's to take up the technology and offer our general support if they are interested.\n\nI would like to request a tip of **694.20 DOT** (~$6,500 using the 30 day EMA of $9.4/DOT) for this work. I normally bill my time at a $250/hr. rate so this would cover 26 hours of work if I were to bill it at my normal rate. This easily covers the time I've spent writing, debugging, and testing this code.\n\nMy Github contributions to the bot:  [![](https://i.imgur.com/4miioA2.png)](https://github.com/ChaosDAO-org/InternalGov-2.0/graphs/contributors)\n\nVoting Aye on this proposal helps show support for people like me who commit a lot of our spare time to advancing this ecosystem. This is also my first ever tip request for myself so please be nice to me.\n",

      "title": "Integration of Polkadot into ChatG (An Ai Chat Startup)",
      "content": "Hello Polkadot Community, I'm thrilled to be connecting with fellow enthusiasts in this vibrant community. My name is Justin Seeney, from Toronto, Canada, and I've been deeply engaged in online business ventures since 1995. Currently, I'm leading an exciting project called ChatG—an AI Chat website designed to revolutionize online interactions.  \n  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/ZMzDFr5/ChatG1.png)\n\nOn ChatG.com, you can already experience a working version of the chat, but I envision something far more dynamic. Imagine a collaborative chat platform where users can harness the power of various AI models to collaborate on absolutely anything.\n\nMy vision extends beyond mere conversation. We're aiming to create an ecosystem where individuals can come together to generate content, spark creativity, and even contribute directly to projects, utilizing the power of AI. Picture this: a user creates a room titled \"Need help creating a retro-style poster for a killer hamburger movie\" Within moments, like-minded individuals flock to collaborate, offering epic killer hamburger artwork. And here's the kicker—members who contribute outstanding work could receive tips, direct to their Polkadot wallet.  \n  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/Xk2bcR5/ChatG3.png)\n\nAs a Polkadot enthusiast and bag holder myself, I'm eager to contribute to the ecosystem's growth by introducing new members and fostering adoption. With the ChatG brand and a solid marketing strategy, I'm confident I can attract a significant influx of users. My goal is to make Polkadot the exclusive crypto tipping option within the platform, amplifying its reach and impact.\n\nAchieving this vision will require additional development efforts, particularly in implementing a multi-user chat system. Moreover, the competitive landscape for AI Chat is formidable, necessitating substantial marketing investments to ensure the project takes flight.\n\nRegarding the Polkadot amount needed for a substantial advertising push, I estimate 50,000 DOT. However, I'm open to discussing the community's preferred investment level to initiate my plans. In terms of resource allocation, I suggest allocating 25% of the funds to advance project development, including the creation of Android and iOS applications to enhance user experience. The remaining 75% will be dedicated to strategic marketing efforts, catapulting ChatG into prominence within the market.\n\nIf there's enthusiasm for this project, I'm keen on establishing a Discord community where like-minded individuals can gather to share insights and suggestions on additional features that could elevate the success of Polkadot. Together, we can unlock the full potential of ChatG and Polkadot, forging a community-driven ecosystem that empowers creativity, collaboration, and innovation.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to contribute your thoughts to this conversation. I'm here to address any questions or concerns the community may have and thankyou for taking your time to check out the project.  \n  \n\n[My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinseeney/)  \n[ChatG](https://chatg.com/)",

      "content": "**Presentation:**\n\nDear Polkadot Community\nI am Il Marchese del Crypto, an Italian content creator who has been producing cryptocurrency-related content on YouTube for about 4 years. Over time, I have created numerous free content pieces purely out of passion and for studying the Polkadot ecosystem. I believe I have made a significant contribution, albeit small, to spreading knowledge about this fantastic world of Polkadot and its ecosystem.\n\nThrough my YouTube channel [link to your channel], I have crafted various content pieces for Polkadot, directing many individuals to the Italian Telegram group managed by Luca Poggi and many others to relevant groups based on their interests, such as Moonbeam, Acala, Manta Network, Astar, Parallel, and more.\n\nCurrently, I update my followers once or twice a week with Dot chart analysis and cryptocurrency sector news. Furthermore, I have provided detailed instructions on how to participate in crowdloans on Polkadot, explained the basics of Polkadot Js, and introduced the Talisman Wallet.\n\nThrough my public Telegram group, I have assisted several individuals by providing information on various aspects of using the Polkadot blockchain, such as staking Dot, participating in nomination pools, withdrawing auction rewards, and more.\n\nHere are some of the contents I've created on Polkadot:\n\n1. [Funny prediction of Dot's price in 2021](https://youtu.be/N2XqquhT5-Y)\n2. [Explanation of Polkastarter's launchpad operation](https://youtu.be/Y-C1s19hvCA)\n3. [Comparison between Kusama and Polkadot](https://youtu.be/vIV0RxqMufw)\n4. [Using OKX to participate in Dot and Kusama auctions](https://youtu.be/ZNGMzeWKFaY)\n5. [Differences between Polkadot and Cardano](https://youtu.be/ROoqixT1O3s)\n6. [Videos and live streams dedicated to Dot auctions](https://youtube.com/shorts/dHP_LbroBGo)\n7. [Tutorial on participating in crowdloans on Polkadot](https://youtu.be/W0uP4fp4wPE)\n8. [Further exploration of auctions and project investment](https://youtu.be/AVO8QXQvtbs)\n9. [Polkadot parachains FAQ](https://youtu.be/mF_ZjDkGdwk)\n10. [Maximizing profits through Polkadot crowdloans](https://youtu.be/vq2lWt2i-0s)\n11. [Recap of initial auctions and winners](https://youtu.be/o3-mlaufczc)\n12. [Tutorial on the Talisman Wallet](https://youtu.be/g5IbVEaMDnQ)\n13. [Provocative discussion on \"Is Polkadot dead?\" (probably Dot inspiring Dot id DED !?](https://youtu.be/nv1gxH5TiNA)\n14. [Live Q&A sessions on Dot auctions](https://youtube.com/live/O7dsb0cMN40)\n15. [Live discussion with Luca Poggi, Italian Polkadot Admin, on \"Is Polkadot resurrecting? Polkadot 2.0\"](https://youtube.com/live/pvYStfehwXQ)\n\nAll this work has been done from 2020 to 2024, and I will continue to produce content, including updates on Polkadot news and its ecosystem.\n\nWith this request, I ask for compensation in Dot for my contribution to Polkadot's growth and to continue producing useful content. I believe that the time, effort, and study I have invested deserve recognition, but the decision is yours.\n\nfor prove the ownership of this account and Youtube, i insert this note in video description: \n\"Update 24/03/2024: I have just launched a funding request on Polkadot's Open Gov for the work done in the growth of the DOT ecosystem.\"  under this live: https://youtube.com/live/pvYStfehwXQ \n\nThank you for considering my request.\n",

      "title": "This is a tip request for Boosting NFT Education in Latin America with the Polkadot Ecosystem",
      "content": "_______________________________\n\n**PROPONENT**: 16fZxnwnnzArZ7SRhSWUcEhGCFk2XDUxD54VqtaKRmr6FhNR\n\n**DATE:** March 25.\n\n**REQUESTED DOT**: 1.000 DOT\n\n\n\n**SHORT DESCRIPTION**\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/dWKK7Nr/13228-MACZAM-1711129049209.png)\n\n\"This proposal aims to transform the understanding and engagement of Latin America in the world of NFTs through the creation and free distribution of an educational book. The inclusive approach targets schools, universities, social organizations, and street artists, removing economic barriers to democratize knowledge about NFTs. The proposal inspires future creators, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and empowers street artists to explore opportunities in the digital space. Collaboration with social organizations extends the reach to marginalized communities, while measuring local impact and establishing sustainable educational partnerships. The proposal seeks to catalyze a cultural shift towards the adoption and understanding of NFTs in Latin America within the Polkadot ecosystem.\"\n____________________________________________\n\n**1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n**2. PROPOSAL**\n\n\nWe all agree here that the Polkadot ecosystem is the best, and we also agree that we need users, more users. \n\nTypically, efforts are focused on attracting developers from other ecosystems here, and that's fine, but I'm concerned about another group. All the people who are outside of web3. \n\nMy first focus will be Latin America. My work is based on providing knowledge to individuals to facilitate their onboarding to the web3 of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nMy first proposal, which I will detail below, was about DeFi courses and a DeFi book on Polkadot. It has worked very well.\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/xSdDrV2/13228-MACZAM-1711129158976.png)\n\nAdditionally, I have written about other topics such as DeFi on Astar Network and NFTs on Polkadot. Both books are already finalized.\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/VS6j5vJ/13228-MACZAM-1711129145965.png)\n\nThis proposal is about funding to give away the NFT book on Polkadot, in schools, universities, and to artists in Latin America, starting in Chile.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/ZM2TB0y/13228-MACZAM-1711129123911.png)\n\n \nI will visit schools and universities and give away printed books, digital books, and NFT-format books, and I will take the message of the Polkadot ecosystem to the streets, classrooms, and groups of people who are not familiar with Polkadot. Attached are links to the mentioned books.\n\n\n\n•\tHere is an example of a book written about DEFI on Astar Network. https://a.co/d/6dF8Jki\n\n•\tHere the Book Digital. https://a.co/d/3oi92Kw\n\n•\tHere is the index of the book. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XZpwHzWBiTWPh2HJXg6PyuaTzcaFOImI/view?usp=sharing\n\n•\tAttached is a detailed budget for the entire proposal. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_c1pf9tikxZjYDx2-Lj3KOHmNchEuPGA/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114936309332560350563&rtpof=true&sd=true\n\n\n\n\n**3. PROPOSAL OBJECTIVES**\n\n\n•\tUniversal Educational Inclusion: Ensure widespread knowledge dissemination on NFTs in Polkadot by distributing the book in schools, universities, and social organizations.\n•\tAccess Democratization: Gift a substantial number of copies to ensure diverse communities, regardless of resources, have access to key information about NFTs in Polkadot.\n•\tInspiring Future Creators: Motivate young artists and creators to explore the potential of NFTs in Polkadot as a platform to showcase and monetize their art.\n•\tInterdisciplinary Collaborations: Stimulate collaboration across different disciplines by introducing NFTs in Polkadot within academic environments, fostering intersections between art, technology, and business.\n•\tEngaging with Social Organizations: Collaborate with social organizations to bring the book to marginalized communities, promoting educational and economic opportunities through understanding NFTs in Polkadot.\n•\tEmpowering Street Artists: Distribute the book among street artists to offer new perspectives on how they can leverage NFTs in Polkadot to expand their art and generate income.\n•\tPromoting Responsible Digital Culture: Educate students and communities on responsibility and ethics in the digital world, encouraging safe and conscious practices when engaging in the NFT space in Polkadot.\n•\tFacilitating Educational Events and Talks: Organize educational events, talks, and workshops in collaboration with schools, universities, and organizations to delve deeper into the topics presented in the book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**4. WORK REPORT**\n\nA detailed report on the project's outcomes will be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**5. PRESUPUESTO TOTAL**\n\nTOTAL, 9.700 USD , ó 1000 DOT. (9,7 DOT/usd\n\n\n\n\n\n**6. PROJECT LIDER**\n\nMacZam, a Chilean engineer with a master's in Finance and Investments, a Diploma in Cybersecurity, and 20 years of experience in the financial industry in Chile. MacZam has been a professor at various universities in Chile, currently teaching NFT classes in The Valley Chile's Metaverse Diploma, and DEFI classes in Lytryum Academy focusing on the Polkadot ecosystem. MacZam is the creator of the GreenBoard DEFI YouTube channel, part of WAG Media, and author of the first decentralized finance book with examples of DEFI protocols deployed on Astar Network, available on Amazon. \nMacZam is a former ambassador for Darwinia Network and Astar Network in Latin America.Network \n\nFor more information, click\n\nhttps://cl.linkedin.com/in/macariozamoranofuentes\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Criptomaczam1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@CriptoMacZam\n\nhttps://a.co/d/6dF8Jki\n\nhttps://a.co/d/3oi92Kw\n\nhttps://medium.com/@MacarioZamorano/dapp-staking-c26875b2038f\n\n\n**7. ABOUT MY PREVIOUS PROPOSAL**\n\nThe proposal consists of three stages. \n\nThe first stage has concluded. During the months of January, February, and March, the first free course on decentralized finance (DeFi) with a focus on the Polkadot ecosystem was conducted, covering key topics such as staking, liquid staking, swaps, AMM DEX, loans, yield aggregators, and reliable information sources. \n\n\n80 people from 9 countries, including Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Spain,... enrolled, and finally, 15 out of 80 students passed the final exam.\n\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/R0bNPYK/13228-MACZAM-1711132010159.jpg)\n\n\nIt has been a success.

The inclusive approach targets schools, universities, social organizations, and street artists, removing economic barriers to democratize knowledge about NFTs. The proposal inspires future creators, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and empowers street artists to explore opportunities in the digital space. Collaboration with social organizations extends the reach to marginalized communities, while measuring local impact and establishing sustainable educational partnerships. The proposal seeks to catalyze a cultural shift towards the adoption and understanding of NFTs in Latin America within the Polkadot ecosystem.\"\n____________________________________________\n\n**1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n**2. PROPOSAL**\n\n\nWe all agree here that the Polkadot ecosystem is the best, and we also agree that we need users, more users. \n\nTypically, efforts are focused on attracting developers from other ecosystems here, and that's fine, but I'm concerned about another group. All the people who are outside of web3. \n\nMy first focus will be Latin America. My work is based on providing knowledge to individuals to facilitate their onboarding to the web3 of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nMy first proposal, which I will detail below, was about DeFi courses and a DeFi book on Polkadot. It has worked very well.\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/xSdDrV2/13228-MACZAM-1711129158976.png)\n\nAdditionally, I have written about other topics such as DeFi on Astar Network and NFTs on Polkadot. Both books are already finalized.\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/VS6j5vJ/13228-MACZAM-1711129145965.png)\n\nThis proposal is about funding to give away the NFT book on Polkadot, in schools, universities, and to artists in Latin America, starting in Chile.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/ZM2TB0y/13228-MACZAM-1711129123911.png)\n\n \nI will visit schools and universities and give away printed books, digital books, and NFT-format books, and I will take the message of the Polkadot ecosystem to the streets, classrooms, and groups of people who are not familiar with Polkadot.

ABOUT MY PREVIOUS PROPOSAL**\n\nThe proposal consists of three stages. \n\nThe first stage has concluded. During the months of January, February, and March, the first free course on decentralized finance (DeFi) with a focus on the Polkadot ecosystem was conducted, covering key topics such as staking, liquid staking, swaps, AMM DEX, loans, yield aggregators, and reliable information sources. \n\n\n80 people from 9 countries, including Chile, Argentina, Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Spain,... enrolled, and finally, 15 out of 80 students passed the final exam.\n\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/R0bNPYK/13228-MACZAM-1711132010159.jpg)\n\n\nIt has been a success.

The inclusive approach targets schools, universities, social organizations, and street artists, removing economic barriers to democratize knowledge about NFTs. The proposal inspires future creators, fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, and empowers street artists to explore opportunities in the digital space. Collaboration with social organizations extends the reach to marginalized communities, while measuring local impact and establishing sustainable educational partnerships. The proposal seeks to catalyze a cultural shift towards the adoption and understanding of NFTs in Latin America within the Polkadot ecosystem.\"\n____________________________________________\n\n**1. CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n\n\n**2. PROPOSAL**\n\n\nWe all agree here that the Polkadot ecosystem is the best, and we also agree that we need users, more users. \n\nTypically, efforts are focused on attracting developers from other ecosystems here, and that's fine, but I'm concerned about another group. All the people who are outside of web3. \n\nMy first focus will be Latin America. My work is based on providing knowledge to individuals to facilitate their onboarding to the web3 of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nMy first proposal, which I will detail below, was about DeFi courses and a DeFi book on Polkadot. It has worked very well.\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/xSdDrV2/13228-MACZAM-1711129158976.png)\n\nAdditionally, I have written about other topics such as DeFi on Astar Network and NFTs on Polkadot. Both books are already finalized.\n \n![image](https://i.ibb.co/VS6j5vJ/13228-MACZAM-1711129145965.png)\n\nThis proposal is about funding to give away the NFT book on Polkadot, in schools, universities, and to artists in Latin America, starting in Chile.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/ZM2TB0y/13228-MACZAM-1711129123911.png)\n\n \nI will visit schools and universities and give away printed books, digital books, and NFT-format books, and I will take the message of the Polkadot ecosystem to the streets, classrooms, and groups of people who are not familiar with Polkadot.

CONTEXT OF THE PROPOSAL**\n\n\"In the fascinating universe of NFTs, information is the key that unlocks doors of opportunity and creativity. However, in the vast landscape of the Spanish language, the need for educational material on NFTs is more evident than ever. Faced with the growing digital revolution, there is a palpable urgency to provide accessible resources to individuals, schools, and universities taking their first steps on this exciting journey.\nImagine those who, for the first time, delve into the concept of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). How can they comprehend the possibilities offered by these unique digital pieces if information is scarce in their native language? This gap not only limits access to crucial knowledge but also hinders participation in a phenomenon that is redefining how we conceive art, property, and digital culture.\nIn the educational realm, schools and universities are nurseries of knowledge, but how can they cultivate a full understanding of NFTs when resources in Spanish are limited? The lack of educational material in this language creates a learning gap that affects the ability of teachers and students to explore and understand the revolutionary potential of NFTs.\n\nThe shortage of information in Spanish is not simply a linguistic barrier; it is a barrier to active participation in the global digital landscape. Those who wish to immerse themselves in the world of NFTs, whether as creators, collectors, or enthusiasts, deserve resources in their native language that enable them to understand, explore, and harness all the possibilities offered by this technology.\nIt is imperative, then, to fill this educational void. Creating Spanish-language material on NFTs is not just a response to current demand but an investment in building a more diverse, informed, and active community in the digital revolution. Providing these resources is not only an act of inclusion but also an open door to new perspectives, opportunities, and the democratization of knowledge in the vast and diverse Spanish-speaking world.\"\n\n\n**2.

In the past, we applied for a grant from Kusama to retroactively support work that began with a profile of 400 followers in August 2023. We have continued this work on the profile, creating original content and hosting spaces with the Lusophone community, despite limited resources. However, working under such uncertainty, as in the OpenGov democracy where DOT holders decide what gets funded, has been challenging.\n\nOverall, we have observed two patterns in content producer funding. Native creators, often ecosystem ambassadors and enthusiasts, predominantly produce content exclusively for Polkadot. These creators seek retroactive funding for the content delivered in recent weeks/months. Additionally, we have seen creators from outside the ecosystem submitting proposals to the treasury for content that will be created in the future.\n\nThis proposal aims to request both. Retroactive funding for four months of work already completed and assurance for three more months of work ahead. But that's not all!

It's Goku.\n\nFollowing the retroactive tipping culture started by Csaint and others, I’m also stepping up to request a retroactive tip for my contributions to the ecosystem from August 2023 until today.

      "title": "Big Tipper Proposal: ETHDenver Official Afterparty (Bash) Polkadot Airdrop ",
      "content": "Date of the event: 02 March\n\nTreasury requested: 1000 DOT\n\nProponent address: 13EDmaUe89xXocPppFmuoAZaCsckaJy3deAyVyiykk1zKQbF\n\nObjective:\n\n  \nFollowing acceptance and funding of PMEI’s Bounty#17 proposal for [{bash}: an ETHDenver Official Afterparty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ITaXGvd_9_Q7D_0X4z2wo3O2wG_bKtCS0SBxlC-aUTo/edit), the producing team is seeking to onboard attendees to the Polkadot Ecosystem by way of wallet downloads and event airdrops.  \n  \nAn existential deposit is needed in each wallet for this purpose. We therefore propose seeding the new existential 0.1 DOT deposit for all 5k-6k attendees of this official afterparty, totaling 500-600 DOT, with some excess DOT reserved for excess wallet downloads and gas fees. \n\n  \nThe objective of this proposal is to leverage the excitement of {bash} Eth Denver's official afterparty, Bash, to drive significant Polkadot wallet downloads and subsequent engagement within the Polkadot ecosystem. By making wallet download a requirement to attend the event and incentivizing attendees to download the Nova wallet with token drops, we aim to facilitate one of the largest onboarding events for Polkadot wallets downloaded for the purposes of a Polkadot Event.\n\nOur goal is to also educate non-Polkadot native attendees that Polkadot onboarding is not difficult and that there is a thriving ecosystem building incredibly user-friendly products. \n\nFurthermore, by fostering partnerships with Polkadot projects, we intend to encourage attendees to actively utilize their wallets beyond the event, thereby contributing to the growth and vibrancy of the Polkadot ecosystem—in a seamless & frictionless way.  \n  \nPolkadot Projects we have engaged with  \n  \n\nNova\n\nHydra\n\nBifrost\n\nStellaswap\n\nMoonbeam\n\nStrategy:\n\n-   Airdrop Incentive: Allocate 1000 DOT tokens to be distributed as incentives for attendees to download the Nova wallet. To ensure widespread participation, gate entry to {bash} with Nova wallet download. This ensures that attendees actively engage with the Polkadot ecosystem in exchange for access to the event.\n    \n-   Existential Deposit Coverage: A portion of this airdrop will be allocated to cover the existential deposit associated with these new accounts.\n    \n\n-   Transaction Fee Coverage: Utilize a portion of the allocated DOT tokens to cover transaction fees associated with the airdrop. This ensures a seamless and cost-effective distribution process for the attendees.\n    \n-   Post-Event Engagement: Partner with Polkadot projects to promote the utilization of dropped tokens on their platforms. Encourage attendees to explore and utilize the functionalities of their wallets beyond the event experience. This could include participating in decentralized applications (dApps), staking, or trading within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n    \n-   Community Building: Leverage the momentum generated by the airdrop and partnerships to foster a sense of community among attendees and to drive a sense of excitement to explore the Polkadot ecosystem.\n    \n\nImpact:\n\n-   Achieve one of the largest Polkadot wallet downloads event associated with any event, with an estimated target of 4.5K-6K attendees downloading the Nova wallet.\n    \n\n-   Drive excitement and engagement within the Polkadot ecosystem, leading to increased adoption and utilization of Polkadot wallets and associated projects.\n    \n\n-   Foster partnerships and collaborations between Polkadot projects and attendees, thereby expanding the reach and impact of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n    \n\n-   Run a post event email marketing campaign to drive deeper adoption of Polkadot ecosystem projects/dapps where airdrop tokens can be used.\n    \n-   Establish Bash as a leading platform for promoting Polkadot and facilitating community engagement within the blockchain space.\n    \n\nContingent on the success of this campaign we may request additional  DOT funding to drive further engagement with the new wallet holders/attendees in partnership with major Polkadot ecosystem teams. \n\nFor ETH Denver, we are collaborating with the following teams: \n\n-   Distractive - leading the charge on Polkadot’s main marketing efforts\n    \n-   Nova Wallet - for Polkadot accessible mobile experience \n    \n-   Moonbeans - prizes and collectibles \n    \n-   Exiled Racers - engaging gamified, in-person prediction experiences\n    \n-   Underscore Labs - Kenji — developer support with onboarding flows and web3 abstraction\n    \n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Polkadot Airdrop at {bash} presents a unique opportunity to drive significant adoption and engagement within the Polkadot ecosystem. By incentivizing wallet downloads, covering transaction fees, and fostering post-event engagement through partnerships, this proposal aims to leave a lasting impact on attendees and contribute to the continued growth and development of Polkadot and its associated projects.",

      "content": "![](https://i.ibb.co/Pryxcm7/d1.png)\n\nDOT LATAM DAY is a spin-off of Polkadot LATAM DAY, the ecosystem's main in-person event in Latin America. This year Polkadot LATAM DAY had to be postponed to 2024 and this would mean a break with the tradition of always holding a major broadcast on December 15th with the presence of everyone who is making a difference in the development of the ecosystem in Latin America.\n\nDue to this setback, we held this first edition of DOT LATAM DAY as a pre-launch event for Polkadot LATAM DAY itself. Formatted as a return to origins. That is, 100% online and LIVE via streaming.\n\nIt is important to highlight that the entire production of the event took place in less than a month, more precisely between November 26th and December 15th, which required the core team to undertake a radical race against time so that everything took place as planned and without last minute surprises.\n\nAll this effort was worth it because we had an event with impeccable timing and even with schedule adjustments until the last moment, we were able to resolve all the unforeseen situations that occurred without compromising the broadcasts, which took place LIVE.\n\n**DOT LATAM DAY**\n\nDate of completion: December 15th\n\nFrom 9:45 am (UTC -3)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Xtpmtr3/d2.png)\n\n**Event Format.**\n\nIn this edition we use two virtual stages, coordinated simultaneously.

      "content": "Hello Polkadot Community,\n\nI’m Milton, one half of the Crypto Youtube channel, CryptoWise.\n\nI have been a crypto enthusiast since 2017 and in 2020 decided to launch CryptoWise as a way to share everything I’d been learning about in crypto with people beyond my friends and family (who, let's face it were sick of hearing me talk about crypto all the time). Although we cover all crypto on our channel, Polkadot is the chain we have covered most. We affectionately call it our crypto crush.\n\nOver the years we have experimented with various forms of content and have covered Polkadot and its ecosystem in many ways including Informative deep dive project videos, long form interviews with project founders and more fun and accessible degen focused shows.\n\nWe were covering Polkadot so often that we created a separate Polkadot Playlist on our Youtube Page. To date it has 45 videos in it but we have spoken about Dot and the Dot ecosystem on many more of our videos.\n\nHere are a few of our past videos:\n\n[One of my first videos that covered Parachains launching on Kusama and Polkadot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-abL_zqz48U&list=PL2J6KYOwwiIjpi5CwVNL8-Bg7xQ2vw1tO&index=1)\n\n[Our Interview with AStar Founder Sota Watanabe shortly after their Parachain Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GlRHv3lyns&list=PL2J6KYOwwiIjpi5CwVNL8-Bg7xQ2vw1tO&index=20)\n\n[A general video covering the latest Polkadot news from a couple years ago.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXQkzMBbGgE&list=PL2J6KYOwwiIjpi5CwVNL8-Bg7xQ2vw1tO&index=12)\n\nAs you can see, we are not fair weather Polkadot enthusiasts. We have been here through all the ups and downs. We’ve covered many Polkadot projects large and small, some who unfortunately haven’t survived and some who have become mainstays to the ecosystem such as AStar, Manta, Kilt, Unique, Integritee, Moonbeam, Hydra DX, Bifrost and many others.\n\nIn the last bull run our channel peaked with videos often getting over 10k views and a handful going viral and reaching upwards of 300k views. We had a loyal, active community both on Youtube and Twitter where we had over 7000 followers. Unfortunately, due to personal and financial reasons we had to take a break from the channel in 2022. We also saw our original Twitter account banned for no particular reason. In late 2023 we began to slowly publish content again and have started a new Twitter account @cryptowiseguys. We’re beginning to publish more and more content and hope to be full time again in the coming weeks. Of course, as always, much of our content will cover Polkadot and its ecosystem.\n\nWith the recent allocation of treasury funds going to marketing, it has been fun to watch some of the bigger channels talk about Dot. Although also frustrating to hear how clearly ignorant they are about Dot and the ecosystem. Clearly these people have ignored Dot and are now just speaking about it because they were able to access money to do so. But many of them have not put in the time to fully understand the ecosystem. In a bull market, I know that our channel can once again reach the mid tier size we were and be a voice that speaks about Dot with genuine passion and knowledge about what is happening in the ecosystem.\n\nYour support of this proposal will certainly help us speed up the return to our previous audience engagement. But rest assured, our coverage of Dot will happen regardless of whether this proposal is successful or not. We don’t cover Dot because we expect funds from the treasury, we cover it because we see it as an essential part of Web3.\n\nIf you are so inclined to support our channel through this Big Tipper proposal, we are much appreciated. However, regardless of how you vote, we do hope that you will find us on X and say hello. We love interacting with fellow Dot enthusiasts and especially the projects that have chosen to be powered by Polkadot. And since we had to start a new X account we have lost contact with many of our previous Dot network. \n\nThanks for your consideration.\n\nSincerely,  \nMilton  \nCryptoWise is Ded",

      "content": "GM everybody,\n\nTotal Requested: 900 DOT\n\nContact: DM on X [Csaint02](https://twitter.com/csaint02)\n\nIt does seem to be the trend to request tips for yourself these days, but regardless...I am requesting a retroactive tip for content creation. This is somewhat of a litmus test to see what value the community brings to my content creation, reply guy tendencies, and ability to bring more visibility to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nI have been creating content in the Polkadot eco for some time now with almost 3 years experience reading, researching, creating, writing, editing, and fostering new content creators. In the past, I was a member of The Kusamarian team and thoroughly enjoyed my work with Jay, Pnin, Monte, Blacklodge, and the rest of the squad. I had to step away for personal reasons and now create content based on free time, burning passions, and overal zeal for the Polkadot eco. I also have experience in fostering new content creators as they hone their craft previously through WagMedia, many of whom you may interact with on a day to day basis.\n\nI recently put up a poll on X about applying for Polkdaot Head Ambassador, but I do NOT plan on applying for this. I believe there are other very deserving candidates out there, and it is simply not in the cards these days. Regardless, I will continue to create content and would appreciate a tip from the community if you all think it is reasonable. This is for my past individual threads and more recent work as noted below. As a side note, I've never used ads and grew my audience from 0\n\nTotal Impressions from December to now: >600K impressions\n\nKey Followers: Chris Burniske, IvanOnTech, Rob Habermeier, Altcoin Daily, Cagy (gamer), multiple parachain teams, and many >50K accounts with large followings. Frequently liked, occasionally retweeted by these influencers\n\nTop Highlights: \n\n1.  [Apps On Polkadot](https://x.com/csaint02/status/1751968502708391999?s=20) — Reposted and highlighted on IvanOnTech's channel w/ > 500K subscribers\n2.  [Polkadot 2.0 Updates](https://x.com/csaint02/status/1750518974566244701?s=20)\n3.  [HydraDX Breakdown](https://x.com/csaint02/status/1746878541994787307?s=20)\n4.  [PlayMythical Breakdown](https://x.com/csaint02/status/1756317202628964863?s=20)\n5.  Historically, my top thread has been the [first Polkadot 2.0 thread](https://x.com/csaint02/status/1675882495907344385?s=20) with > 230K impressions and almost 600 likes. It is still quoted today\n6.  Multiple replys under large accounts that have started conversations, controversy, or deeper questions\n7.  Many instances where I DM'd with individuals and onboarded them to the eco, some of these interactions are on directly on X as well. [One Example](https://x.com/csaint02/status/1756058188758065355?s=20)\n\nTo see more of my content, check the highlight tab on my X profile.

      "content": "Hello Polkadot community!\n\nClaudio here from the [KryptosChain](https://www.youtube.com/c/kryptoschain) brand. Many of you already know me, but in case you don't, I'm a Content Creator since 2018 on Youtube and have been covering the Polkadot ecosystem since 2020 with some gaps in Polkadot content creation more recently in order to attract an audience outside the bubble.\n\n**Social media channels:**  \nYoutube channel:  https://youtube.com/@kryptoschain  \nX profile: https://twitter.com/KryptosChain\n\nGiven a number of treasury funded creators are already doing News and Interviews from the ecosystem and people told me I would be better suited for tutorials. I would like to propose the following list of tutorials which new users finding out about Polkadot would find them useful. These tutorials will be created in a clear and simple way to help a newbie understand the exact steps that have to be followed.\n\n**1\\. How to perform a cross-chain transfer?** - between Polkadot & Moonbeam and Polkadot and HydraDX with Nova Wallet for mobile & Talisman for desktop.\n\n**2\\. How to transfer USDT from an Exchange to my wallet and then cross-chain transfer to Moonbeam & HydraDX?** - with both Nova and Talisman.\n\n**3\\. How to vote in Open Gov?** - with both Nova (natively) and Talisman (using Polkassembly).\n\n**4\\. How to stake DOT in a nomination pool?** - with both Nova and Talisman.\n\n**5\\. How to set up a multisig wallet?** - with NovaSpektr.\n\n**6\\. How to delegate DOT to another wallet?** - with Nova and either Talisman or Novaspektr\n\n**7\\. How to provision liquidity to a single token on HydraDX?** - with Nova and Talisman\n\n**8\\. How to stake DOT on Bifrost?** - with Nova and Talisman.\n\nThe above tutorials will be uploaded to both Youtube and my X profile natively.\n\n**Total:** 8 videos @ $500 each = $4,000 to deliver them all in about **3 weeks** maximum once payment is received. I'm also requesting roughly $100 per video to pay for X ads for a 2 week campaign on each tutorial to amplify them out to a potential new audience.\n\n**Total amount:** 712.17 DOT worth about $4,800 with today's DOT price of $6.73 at the time of launching this referendum.\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via DM on Telegram @KryptosChain or on X with the same handle.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "content": "Hey all, \n\nIn 2017, I remember watching a video of Gavin Wood explaining Polkadot during its ICO phase; I always liked the idea but never got involved in the ICO due to being in too many at the time. \n\nFast forward to the release. I bought it and started doing content around Polkadot in its early days, bringing people into the ecosystem through awareness videos, educational content and tweets. \n\nI've done videos on Polkadot and its parachains, such as Moonbeam, Bifrost, and HydraDX, mentioning others such as Interlay, Centrifuge and Astar. \n\nThe first video I did on Polkadot was in August 2020. \n\nI've done 44 videos averaging around 8-9K views over the duration, from a small YouTube account sizer to a larger one over the four years. I fully expect my channel to continue growing over the next few years.\n\nI also use X a lot to create awareness around Polkadot. Averaging around 25K-50K views on good posts and reposting other ecosystem news. \n\nMy company admins also set up a Learning Crypto Staking Pool, which has over 100,000 DOT (due to the limits on staking self-custody) \n\nLinks:\n\n[https://twitter.com/MarketMobsterUK](https://twitter.com/MarketMobsterUK)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJ90kZCcv5oTSeqJLlFyqA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJ90kZCcv5oTSeqJLlFyqA)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/928F41t/Screenshot-2024-02-07-T094239-550.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/wwwfBkp/Screenshot-2024-02-07-T094327-854.png)",

I have been creating content for Polkadot since 2022, working as a blockchain analyst for projects like Crypto357 and a moderator for [Mercurius](https://www.youtube.com/@0xmercurius).\n\nTwitter/X —  [https://twitter.com/defiguy22](https://twitter.com/defiguy22)  \n  \nYoutube —  [https://www.youtube.com/@defiguy22](https://www.youtube.com/@defiguy22)  \n  \nTelegram — [https://t.me/+QfslDL\\_epwZlMmUx](https://t.me/+QfslDL_epwZlMmUx)\n\n**You can check the full proposal here — [https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NBBWwgP0OjH3XVF-Sa5fn6hClZZlDZvkRySMec0g5U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15NBBWwgP0OjH3XVF-Sa5fn6hClZZlDZvkRySMec0g5U/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n  \nAlmost a year ago, I launched two YouTube channels: [Degen Radio](https://www.youtube.com/@degenradio), focusing on general crypto content including interviews with notable figures such as Blockworks researchers, prominent fintech analysts, VCs capital analysts; and a channel dedicated to content around the Astar and Polkadot ecosystem, called [Defiguy channel](https://www.youtube.com/@defiguy22) , both channels focusing mainly in Portuguese language, but also English content. Currently, I host two livestreams a week covering various themes, typically structured around:\n\n-   **— Governance analysis**\n-   **— On-chain data (TVL, DAU, smart contract deployments, staking)**\n-   **— Tech updates (featuring Polkadot technologies like Async Backing, XCM, and System chains)**\n-   **— Parachains fundamental analysis (focusing on value propositions and tokenomics)**\n    \n    **— Q&A (talking with the community and taking some questions, helping them on CRM)**\n    \n    **— Interviews with key figures on Polkadot ecosystem (started at Astar Network)**\n\nI've achieved interesting KPIs for a new channel, averaging 40/50 concurrent live viewers with great retention, ranging around 400/500 views per live (competitive number puting aside a very niche content and bear market situation). Compared to other Polkadot channels funded by the treasury, I have above-average interactions and view counts.  \n  \n**— Watch time of 3.3K Hours**  \n**— Total 6 months views — 15K**  \n  \n  \n**Data Visualization around 6/7 months of content (July 2023 — February 2024)**  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/1Qgrhdj/Screen-Shot-2024-02-02-at-18-23-18.png)\n\n  \nAdditionally, my Twitter/X profile (defiguy22) **with 2438 Followers**, where I also share my livestreams and threads about the Polkadot ecosystem, **reaches an average of 60K impressions a month.  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/FqHvh35/Screen-Shot-2024-02-03-at-13-31-59.png)  \n  \nJuly 2023 — September 2023 -

      "content": "Proposer: Polkalytics  \nContact & Beneficiaries: @alice\\_und\\_bob on Twitter / Telegram, @xcjeeper on Twitter  \nRequested DOT: 952 DOT (6,000 EUR at 7-Day EMA of 6.3 EUR/DOT)\n\n**Overview**\n\nThis is a retroactive proposal for creating and publishing educational materials around the state of OpenGov, leading discussions, and introducing how to advance it. Polkadot OpenGov is fairly young and ecosystem participants need more experience in open and collective governance. Our material has contributed to onboarding users into the OpenGov mindset and exposed participants to more structured theories around OpenGov.\n\n**Educational Content**\n\nWe published two educational OpenGov videos of 34 minutes each.\n\n1.  [Coalitions and Opposition](https://youtu.be/C4pecS-MRzc?si=RFnAfdau71paU2ix) reflected on the topic of formulating a strategic mindset around governance strategies and explained the model of Giotto’s “Autonomous Marketing Initiative” (AMI). The philosophy behind, as well as the strategic and tactical components of AMI, are summarized, mental frameworks on how to make decisions and formulate personal decision criteria are reflected. The video concludes with a discussion about how coalitions and opposition might form in the future.\n2.  [The Future of OpenGov](https://youtu.be/5Mz5gB-DBHg?si=3tS9Fd1RBfVtltYo) presents a framework on how to evolve OpenGov. We introduce a differentiation of legislative (”What should we do?”, expressed as on-chain voting) and executive (”How do we do it?”, expressed by the implementation of funded participants) and flesh out how each existing and some future components of OpenGov can be considered under this view. We show how OpenGov as practiced today works and where participants can join the process. We introduce additional mental models that help participants understand Governance.\n\n**Leading Discussions**\n\nWe pushed users to reflect on the presented materials in several discussions\n\n-   We presented a semi-formal [Governance Framework](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-governance-framework-v2023-09/4014) as Polkadot Forum post and pushed the discussion [with a presentation](https://twitter.com/TheKusamarian/status/1710033776741351697) on AAG.\n-   To highlight how current discussions can lead to governance action, we opened the discussion on one of the main issues in the Polkadot ecosystem: [Developer Experience must be our #1 priority](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/developer-experience-must-be-our-1-priority/3957) is among the top engaged threads on Polkadot Forums. Strategically published before Sub0, it spawned many discussions on-site and led ecosystem agents to contribute to a [shared list of perceived issues](../264b338f38184248acbf630879f8386f?pvs=25) that can be picked up for future initiatives and bounties\n\n**Impact**\n\n-   We reflected on Giotto’s current governance discourse and embedded our educational materials into the conversation ([example](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob/status/1739613884955119936)). The public discourse with Giotto ([here](https://twitter.com/giottodf/status/1739683755768287293)) was interweaved with his formulation of the current expert groups.\n-   The general direction in the written and video content provided governance participants with varying perspectives on the establishment of different coalitions and initiatives within the socio-political sphere of Polkadot OpenGov. We also think that the [The Future of OpenGov](https://youtu.be/C4pecS-MRzc?si=PPmWLeaZ2skvCBpw) in this proposal greatly helped the Polkadot community to understand the efforts of the Autonomous Marketing Initiative and enabled further community engagement around the ideas of reforming the marketing efforts of the Polkadot brand in general.\n\nCost Breakdown\n\n| Cost Components | Amount (EUR) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Preliminary Research, Discussions, and Planning | 500 |\n| Production of Educational Content | 4000 |\n| Leading Follow-Up discussions & Providing Summaries | 500 |\n| SUM | 5000 |\n| VAT | 1000 |\n| TOTAL | 6000 |\n\n**About Polkalytics**\n\n**[Polkalytics](https://www.polkalytics.io/)** is an analytics boutique that offers data-driven reporting and consulting for Polkadot. Polkalytics builds a Google-scale analytics service for Polkadot.

Included are the Treasury Report, accompanying tables, and an open-sourced Python Jupyter Notebook to reproduce the results. The Treasury Report was picked up by several news outlets, including Binance, Coinmarketcap, BigGet Exchange, and others.\n\n**The Report**\n\nOur report provides a structural perspective on the management of treasury funds and paving the way for a more proactive approach to future spending proposals.

With the great changes taking place in the world, the interest in blockchain technology ended up becoming the current focus in my professional development, having recently joined the team of content creators at WAG Media, Equilibrium and Polimec (Ambassadors Programs on Polkadot Ecosystem) and started an experimental channel on Youtube called Medo de Ficar de Fora (which is the translation of Fear of Missing Out in portuguese), also a contributor to the Youtube channel Verbo da Sabedoria and The Kusamarian.\n\nOur Portfolio:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186R9xgXZbGvsKT1\\_GYgR4ir1lc7Dnr\\_JnCdI3nbgeUE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186R9xgXZbGvsKT1_GYgR4ir1lc7Dnr_JnCdI3nbgeUE/edit?usp=sharing) - This portfolio got funded by Wagmedia\n\n2 - The motivation for this proposal:\n\nCommunication through digital media channels has become one of the most effective ways to reach and influence vast audiences in the modern era. Our channel, Verbo da Sabedoria, has made its mark by producing high-quality, impactful content for the Portuguese community in Polkadot. However, to continue expanding and enhancing our reach, we require funding. Here are the reasons why investing in our channel is pivotal.\n\nEducational: If our channel has an educational bent, funding will allow us to produce content that not only entertains, but also educates and informs audiences, making a positive contribution to Polkadot beginners and enthusiasts alike.\n\nTechnical Improvement: Funding will allow us to purchase better quality equipment, more advanced editing tools and animation software, thus ensuring a superior visual and sound experience for our audience.\n\nExpand Polkadot Contents: With adequate funding, we will be able to diversify and expand our content portfolio, covering more varied topics and innovative formats, thus reaching an even larger and more diverse audience.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion: Through effective advertising campaigns, we can expand our reach and attract new followers. Promotion is vital for any channel that wants to grow and stand out in a saturated market.\n\nConsistency and Frequency: Funding will ensure we have the resources we need to consistently produce content, keeping our audience engaged and expanding our impact in Brazil.\n\n3 - Payment conditions:\n\nWhat is the amount requested? 673 DOT\n\nWhat is the address of the fund recipient? 14iWWjHr2VLTNW2p5ZzmqNeD1ox2udjsU9VsP5k3murqeNiJ\n\nHow can we contact the manager of the funds?\n\nName: John Rhodel Bartolome Email: [johnrhodelbartolome@gmail.com](mailto:johnrhodelbartolome@gmail.com) Telegram: @parachainboy Discord: johnrhodel\n\nName: Gabriel Bonugli Email: [gabrielbonuglii@gmail.com](mailto:gabrielbonuglii@gmail.com) Telegram: @gabekoin Discord: gabekoin\n\nName: Carlos Sawaki Email: [carlosawaki@gmail.com](mailto:carlosawaki@gmail.com) Telegram: @carlosawaki Discord: cejota\n\nIf you have any doubts, please contact us, we are open to suggestions, thank you very much.",

      "content": "**Proponent:** 12WQMLv8itdKJ83R4y3qNGYCRrsU6bFjyd4ZvcE4tmJoSiPv\n\nHello everyone, this is John Rhodel (parachainboy) writing. I am here to request retroactive funding from the treasury, **Requested DOT: 282** dot price = 6,45 USD  \n\nfor the Multichain MEETUP event that I organized in my city of Curitiba, Brazil, which took place on December 13, 2023.\n\nThis was the first multichain event organized in the city to integrate and inform everyone about Polkadot and the invited networks.\n\n**Check the full proposal here:** [Proposal Multichain MeetUP - Curitiba](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D2gcxivKDvx1DHtrvvItt5eVQyBBhkfX2jNjm7llI_U/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/KxL8vPH/br-multi.png)\n\n**This event was publicized by various media outlets and communities:**\n\n**Cointelegraph Brasil:**\n\n[https://br.cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-news-binance-will-give-free-cryptocurrency-mb-launches-challenge-chiliz-grows-on-web3-and-other-news](https://br.cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-news-binance-will-give-free-cryptocurrency-mb-launches-challenge-chiliz-grows-on-web3-and-other-news)\n\n**Brazil Crypto Report:**\n\n[https://twitter.com/BrazilCrypto\\_/status/1735302597777485977](https://twitter.com/BrazilCrypto_/status/1735302597777485977)\n\n[https://newsletter.brazilcrypto.io/p/121-itau-launches-crypto-platform#:~:text=Quick%20programming%20note%3A%20I’ll%20be%20in%20Curitiba%20this%20week%20for%20the%20Multichains%20Brasil%20meetup%2C%20which%20will%20happen%20on%20Wednesday%2C%20December%2013](https://newsletter.brazilcrypto.io/p/121-itau-launches-crypto-platform#:~:text=Quick%20programming%20note%3A%20I%E2%80%99ll%20be%20in%20Curitiba%20this%20week%20for%20the%20Multichains%20Brasil%20meetup%2C%20which%20will%20happen%20on%20Wednesday%2C%20December%2013)\n\n**Bankless Brasil:**\n\n[https://twitter.com/BanklessBR/status/1735126480332485063](https://twitter.com/BanklessBR/status/1735126480332485063)\n\n**Short description:**\n\nCuritiba is exploring Web3 technologies such as decentralized finance, digital identity, smart contracts, supply chain transparency, civic engagement, and NFTs. Embracing these technologies can enhance financial inclusion, privacy, governance, economic growth, and support the local art scene.\n\nCuritiba's tech-savvy community makes it well-suited to adopt and benefit from Web3 advancements. Hosting the Multichain Meetup party in Curitiba would promote awareness, collaboration, education, networking, and community building within the local blockchain ecosystem.\n\nIt would contribute to the growth and adoption of Polkadot and blockchain technology in the region, positioning Curitiba as a hub for innovation in this field.\n\n**The motivation for this proposal:**\n\nThis proposal aims to offer a Multichain Meetup in Curitiba, Brazil to gather the local community to experience the event all together. Hosting this event in Curitiba offers access to cutting-edge insights, networking opportunities, community building, learning experiences, and helps promote the city as a tech hub.\n\nThe Multichain MEET UP will be held in a coworking space in a well-known neighborhood in Curitiba Batel, close to universities UTFPR and with easy access to public transport and easy transit.\n\nWhy didn't I go through the event bounty? The event bounty is not yet operational, so I decided to try for the funds through Treasury and Governance.\n\nAll costs and expenses were transparently spreadsheeted with receipts so the community can be fully aware of what was spent, maintaining truth and transparency above all with the Token Holders.\n\n**Costs, budget and Receipts:**\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ENGLISH |     |\n| Budgets | Cost in USD |\n| Venue Rental: | 650 |\n| Photographer | 600 |\n| T-shirts | 375 |\n| Stickers | 95  |\n| Brochure | 50  |\n| total bid cost USD | 1.770,00 |\n\n**Budget:**\n\n|     |\n| --- |\n| Venue Rental [Budget Nex - Resumido.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-lEFYGS2V-RaF1KRS2jeHBWc5xDgra8-/view?usp=sharing) |\n| Photographer [PHOTO Budget.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bjxHGoZ6KpO4d5oAmP9gmfnwEG5S5O9-/view?usp=sharing) |\n| T-shirts [Tshirts Budget POLKADOT.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iG45ojnjm2aVciOBi9z1gyTKr6uZAov_/view?usp=drive_link) |\n| Stickers [Stickers Polkadot.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b9NVXAzdj9BWWvHmvZA4yEVjurDzZEAs/view?usp=sharing) / [Stickers kusama.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wJE4IKkqq-84hfdBm6-Kx4R5DnzvlagH/view?usp=sharing) |\n| Brochure [BROCHURE - MULTICHAIN MEETUP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qdqPR5b8yOe91O5ezd-Mo48cffBg-A59IanVyjiHPm8/edit?usp=sharing) |\n\n**Receipts:** \n\n|     |     |     |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| RECEIPTS | Cost in USD | Cost in BRL |\n| [Receipt - Nex.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J_jFxtosnv1-fhBPd0sm6kDSt_n_9bzd/view?usp=drive_link) - Venue | 650 | 3215,00 BRL |\n| Photographer - [Receipt - Son Creativa.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXyA1qbpY87KFyUofGRe8RmXAr2l2XA4/view?usp=sharing) | 600 | Payed in USDT |\n| T-shirts - [Receipt Shirts BRL.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXNhm-1nMgQBAUJom5yn0U3cIm3zRm4D/view?usp=sharing) | 375 | 1875,00 BRL |\n| Stickers - [Receipt Qualigraff - stickers.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJOnGf-p0RuTxb-kMN2ymnOoWqEOf6JN/view?usp=sharing) | 95  | 470,00 BRL |\n| Brochure - [Receipt - 360 grafica (brochure).pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ym4rgtlGru_T1kjlAEIuQD_5P0_3pmAg/view?usp=sharing) | 50  | 247,00 BRL |\n\n**Shirts - 50 - [FINAL DESIGN POLKADOT.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MuY3UWvzuhz2V6KpJC9NrC58YDgbvNVG/view?usp=sharing)**\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/m2TfDwYqynwiCN4CqJKlhdTA4Ze6EU0YSZe8wDVJZknrv77Zh867FP_UGOwzoIxWE-Ie-0Gs6y7k1h9VuXycVAHD7NIX7XA-T9RQeJDASe3Kzjy_oASinXQgRA86jZaqN6UJYnT_HLgZBCSDbCVWtMU)\n\n**Stickers (50 Kusama and 50 Polkadot 7cmx7cm)**\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/sofDau5Oxw19NALDf9MKIqDht9QhwKq3tPZFxHDI3Dd7l-QQ_qUPc7Hn3mHv4PoSlONZFt-P7EQ0yGlA__QQBdaNzNloCeQOYeDa8wdOpnPj9RhjSx2uZU5L0T4bKpgyFj2if3O1JyzX3UaY9-oOxtM)\n\n**Brochure (100):**\n\n**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/psG-GhE0TNq5z-7lN1hZQr-HdT4u97tHbxhrtEY0vLhzCxIJOfTGGSHZdHbPZUpq2kVpYB92vkILrqdwGGWt6938rmrHyinBzvX75-2CM6umKpxxoNfDKy4Cd29cHVd-nwAOXS3a3dTVra6GgFrQ828)**\n\n**![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/VAYQCpn9Hh3YeduT91ITBc0TyhsHwOUiTKBG1aK3JbFkPFPyUFnbVYdahXWmBuMqgSoYsLzNajYdbov_AY3MTEQCLHrUyiYIqQWEGKuyh-mMxMkmkYcqNbqykYW5Ufp-FYzWbN66E0LUwwTplyUhPZE)**\n\n**Why Curitiba?**\n\nCuritiba is a city that has always anticipated future demands and directed its planning policies with a focus on human beings. Since 1970, urban planning has made the city a model of urban management, public transportation, and environmental preservation.\n\nThese policies have earned Curitiba a high quality of life, as evidenced by indicators measuring city development. The Municipal Human Development Index (IDHM) for the capital is 0.856, the Living Condition Index (ICV) is 0.808, and the Synthetic Quality of Life Satisfaction Index is 81.75%. The literacy rate in the city reaches 96.86%.\n\nThe capital of Paraná is part of the group of five Brazilian municipalities that concentrate 27% of the country's total wealth. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), in 2017, Curitiba's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was R$ 84.7 billion, ranking it fifth nationally. Curitiba's per capita GDP is R$ 44.4 thousand (2017). The Services sector accounts for 84.7% of the total GDP, Industry accounts for 15.28%, and Agriculture for less than 1%.\n\nCuritiba was chosen as the most inspiring city for green areas preservation by the American magazine Wired. The ranking was posted on the magazine's Instagram profile, which has 1.6 million followers. The other cities in the ranking include Seoul (South Korea), Copenhagen (Denmark), New York City (United States), and Singapore (city-state in Asia).\n\nCuritiba also stands out in education. It has the highest literacy rate (96.86%) and, for the third consecutive time, the best performance among Brazilian capitals in the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB). It is home to the first university in Brazil, the Federal University of Paraná, founded in 1912. The city also hosts the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR), the first university of its kind in Brazil.\n\nCuritiba has been internationally recognized and is considered a reference as a city. Curitiba is considered the 2nd Technological Innovation Hub in Brazil, according to a survey by the Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA). It has received titles such as the 2nd Best City for Business in Brazil and the 5th Best City in Latin America for Business, according to América Economia magazine in 2005 and 2006, respectively. It was also named the Best Business Destination by Veja magazine in 2007 and ranked 3rd among Infrastructure Champions by Exame magazine in 2006. In addition, it was recognized as the 2nd Best City in Southern Brazil to work in, according to Você S.A. magazine in 2005, and as the city with the Best Quality of Life in Brazil, according to the Firjan Development Index (IFDM) in 2005 and 2007.\n\nCuritiba unanimously won the 2010 Globe Award for Sustainable City, organized by the Globe Forum in Sweden, which elects the most sustainable city in the world each year.\n\nAccording to the 2020 Tech Report, Curitiba is the Brazilian capital with the highest productivity and efficiency in the technology sector. The capital is also a standout among national smart cities, ranking 3rd nationwide, behind São Paulo and Florianópolis.\n\nIn 2021, Curitiba was among the seven most intelligent cities in the world and a finalist for the international Intelligent Community of the Year award, promoted by the Intelligent Community Forum (ICF). Among all the finalist cities in South America, Curitiba is a pioneer.\n\n**How was the event from your perspective?

A total of 39 people attended the event. We distributed gifts to the participants, including t-shirts and stickers. We also talked about Polkadot to the general public and had a good time discussing with other networks like Filecoin, Algorand, Near, Hedera, and Zcash.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone stayed until the end for the final Photo because the presentations went on until 10:30 PM. However, I have posted the list of confirmed attendees, and you can look at the files for all photos and testimonials from randomly selected participants here:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/YLNQTcP/participantes.png)\n\n[Video Feedbacks and Testimonials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ihRp5LoVyts1s9aV2IQ9VVtJXt81jkLu?usp=drive_link)\n\n[Photos from event](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xYVclERTYpRPRnALtKL8N8D-hdgiyw7F?usp=sharing)\n\nHow to contact me?\n\nName: John Rhodel Bartolome\n\nEmail: [johnrhodelbartolome@gmail.com](mailto:johnrhodelbartolome@gmail.com)\n\nTelegram: @parachainboy \n\n**Discord: johnrhodel**\n\nAbout me:**  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/N2JKfJG/john.jpg)**\n\n**My name is John Rhodel Bartolomé, I am an Senior ambassador for Polkadot, founder and creator of educational content for Portuguese on the youtube channel and blog \"Verbo Dotsama\" and also a translator and co-founder of content for the blog in Filipino, \"Tagalog Dotsama\", I'm a polkadot ecosystem enthusiast since 2020, I am a software engineer learning Rust to try the POLKADOT ACADEMY in the future, I am an ambassador for some parachains of the ecosystem and very active on twitter @parachainboy, I want to develop a web3 and teaching hub here in the south of the country of Brazil and I believe that the region is an excellent place for growth and knowledge about POLKADOT**",

Key speakers from the Polkadot ecosystem (excluding myself) included:\n\n- **Emi Z** (@metricaez on Twitter) - Parity Tech & PBA alumni\n- **Gabo** - Protofire & PBA alumni\n- **Luca** (@0xLucca on Twitter) - Protofire & PBA alumni\n- **Emma M.** (@MuranoEmmanuel on Twitter) - Zondax\n- **Brian Sasbon** (@briansasbon on Twitter) / Milstein - NeoPower\n- **Augusto C** (@augustechie on Twitter) - Tanssi Network & PBA alumni\n\nOverall, my impression about the event was positive and allowed the local community to meet and listen to great talks and workshops. KodaDot provided POAP NFTs for the event.\n\nMerchandise (stickers, T-shirts, bags) was gone quickly. At the end of the event there was a pizza party with beer, and during the event coffee and tea were always available.\n\nA well-organised small-scale event that in my opinion deserves this retroactive funding to make sure Pepe's expenses are covered and that he will continue to be motivated to organize future events.\n",

      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nI am Mario Andrade, a legal professional and self-taught smart contract developer, expanding my expertise in Rust and Substrate.\n\nI am requesting financial support as I have been accepted into the Founders Track of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA) in Honk Kong, and I need assistance covering my travel expenses.\n\n\\*\\*About soft.law and rotamDAO: \\*\\*\n\nI am the proud founder of soft.law, a legaltech lab dedicated to create innovative solutions for the Polkadot ecosystem. As part of our initiatives, we have established [rotamDAO](https://www.rotam.io/ \"rotam\") a project that garnered recognition in the Polkadot Relayers Incubator organized by Angel Hack. For a detailed overview, you can watch the interview on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTrrYmeRKZY;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTrrYmeRKZY;)\n\nCurrently, we are testing the vehicle tokenization in Mexico. Also you can see our progress via our X account [@rotamDAO](https://twitter.com/rotamDAO \"twitter rotam\")\n\n**The Vision for Polkadot Blockchain Academy:**\n\nThis invaluable experience has inspired our team at soft.law to develop a pallet to provide developers within the ecosystem with legal validations for real-world assets. I am eager to present and refine this concept at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy, emphasizing the critical need for robust legal backing.\n\n**Funding Request:**\n\nUnfortunately, at this moment, I am unable to cover the expenses associated with attending the Polkadot Blockchain Academy in Hong Kong. Therefore, I am requesting 450 DOT, to cover round-trip plane tickets from Mexico and other associated expenses.\n\n**Why Support This Request:**\n\n-   Innovative LegalTech: The proposed pallet addresses the tokenization of real-world assets with a robust legal foundation, showcasing the innovation that soft.law brings to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n    \n-   Proven Track Record: Our participation in the Polkadot Relayers Incubator and the ongoing development of rotamDAO demonstrate our commitment and capability to contribute to the Polkadot community meaningfully.\n    \n-   Community Impact: By supporting this request, you are actively contributing to the advancement of LegalTech and the tokenization of real-world assets within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n    \n\nI kindly ask for your consideration and support in this endeavor. The success of this project not only aligns with my passion and expertise but has the potential to enrich the Polkadot ecosystem as a whole.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely,\n\nMario Andrade\n\nFounder, soft.law\n\n---\n\nUpdate 14/12/2023 19:30 hrs CST\n\nHi community, based on the results I'm seeing, I would appreciate if you could provide feedback and comments. It's my first time proposing to the treasury, and it has been a valuable learning experience. However, I'd like to better understand the community's perspective on areas for improvement.\n\n1.

We had people create not only their first Rust projects, but also their first blockchains with Substrate.\n\nUnfortunately, due to timing constraints (holiday season mostly), we had to host the workshop the weekend before finals, which obviously affected turnout. That being said, this will def not be the last time we try this.",

      "content": "Good day, community. I am Edgar Salinas, founder and CEO of Peranto, an identity platform built on the KILT Protocol. We have won two hackathons throughout the year; however, personally, I have been working on Peranto for 2 and a half years, enduring and embracing the challenges of being a founder.\n\nThe community that knows me is aware that I have not had any other source of income apart from the prizes from hackathons. We have invested these resources in continuous development, operational expenses, living costs, legal matters, equipment upgrades, and everything required to bring Peranto to your computers.\n\nI am making this request because I have been accepted into the Founders track of the Polkadot Blockchain Academy. If I use Peranto's resources to attend, we would be sacrificing two months of operations and development, which are crucial for advancing this dApp.\n\nAs the community knows, the Polkadot treasury has been a general target for proposals related to marketing or projects aiming to promote the Polkadot name in other areas. However, that is not my focus. I will explain my reasons for requesting 4,000 USD.\n\nI started Peranto with the following hypothesis: If internet users can control their digital identity, we can also control the digital identity of the objects we use and own. If this is possible, we can start developing businesses around the circular economy.\n\nMy goals for participating in the PBA are as follows:\n\n- Researching a token economy focused on the circular economy and laying the groundwork for building a parachain.\n- Building a parachain based on the circular economy using our current development of Peranto with KILT as a Decentralized Identity Provider, which can help build these circular businesses and possibly a Universal Basic Income based on these two constants.\n- As a tech-focused founder, my strengths lie in Mexico and Europe. Attending the Academy in Hong Kong will allow me to expand my knowledge regarding regulations and how they relate to the token economy I aim to research and develop.\n- Peranto is a strong team, and meeting other founders and developers can be very beneficial for the ecosystem as a whole, not just for Peranto. My experience can be valuable to someone else, just as their experience can be valuable to me.\n- The founders' track is specially designed to complete a project fundable in 4 weeks. Working with digital identities, I believe this is a great opportunity to tackle that 4-week challenge and propose beyond our implementation with the KILT Protocol.\n- Attending implies expanding my network of contacts, including founders, developers, investors, and mentors like Dr. Gavin Wood. These are contacts that would otherwise take me several months, and as the community knows, in web3, a month is a significant amount of time.\n- Finally, as a Mexican founder, I aim to make the ecosystem turn its attention to Latin America as a window of opportunities, especially in Mexico, where crypto regulations have a high likelihood of being adopted in the next 5 years.\n\nUndoubtedly, going to the PBA aims to continue developing a Peranto vertical that I consider necessary for our world, not just in web3.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Peranto, visit [https://peranto.xyz](url), and if you are in Mexico, you can join the beta through this link [https://forms.gle/PuY72ugGAxDaNhDb8](url), starting on December 15, 2023.\n\nExpense Breakdown:\n\n- $2000: Roundtrip Flight\n- $500: Traveler's Insurance\n- $1000: Emergency Fund, which, if unused, will support the stay in Hong Kong or future flight expenses\n- $500: Miscellaneous and Weekend Expenses",

      "title": "Bring Adoption for Companies: Empowering BlockSpace with PolkadotSDK as the Core Infrastructure",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nI am providing a link to my previous proposal regarding the presentations and descriptions of my work over the years: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/194\n\nI have successfully completed the first two demos (as well as successfully completing all the milestones of the grant), and the third is scheduled for next week, concluding my engagements for this year.\n\nBased on the feedback collected, I have observed that some companies are concerned about unpredictable costs related to GAS/Token Price. \nThis apprehension has limited the feasibility of offering blockchain-based products. \nAs a response, I have categorized corporate clients into two groups: those requiring few transactions, suitable for parachains supporting EVM or Pallet Contracts, and those needing to input large amounts of data, necessitating infrastructure tailored to their needs. \nThe challenge arises because Web2 companies have minimal knowledge of Web3 concepts, making Gas/Token Price difficult to grasp. Consequently, objections arise in favor of using Parachains compared to \"blockchains\" where there are no gas or other unpredictable costs (referring to cloud projects or private blockchains). \nStarting January 2024, my goal is to educate these companies on the differences between leveraging Polkadot's security and other \"blockchains,\" demonstrating how to create a personalized parachain using Substrate (Polkadot SDK). \nCreating a personal parachain for clients with high transaction volumes will overcome Gas/Token-related challenges and allow them to benefit from Polkadot's security. \nAll of this aligns with the upcoming introduction of CoreTime.\n\nFor 2024, I have already identified three companies in Italy eager to delve into blockchain for their specific use cases. I will conduct demos with their Marketing and R&D teams between January and February, building on my existing collaborations. Currently, I am extending this program to other companies I have already worked with, planning additional sessions from March to June.\n\nThe proposed agenda for the training sessions is as follows:\n\n- Day 1 (Onsite with PM & Marketing): Introduction to blockchain and Web3, emphasizing the advantages of choosing Polkadot and Parachains. This day will establish a technical foundation with a focus on Web3 marketing.\n \n- Day 2 (Onsite with PM & Developer): In-depth exploration of the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem.\n \n- Days 3-5 (Remote with Developer): Brief introduction to the Ink! language, followed by https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/build-a-parachain/ a practical guide using Substrate tutorials to create a personalized parachain and seamlessly integrate customer data on-chain, leveraging previous work with TrackingChain.\n \n- Other Days (Remote): Answer and any doubts and other questions to look for company onboarding on PolkadotSDK. \n\n\nI am writing to request a financial contribution of TIPS to cover part of the expenses associated with ongoing and upcoming demonstration initiatives (includes those that I will be able to do until June), the rest of the expenses will be covered by me as if I manage to bring at least one company onto PolkadotSDK I will have benefits as a consultant on this project and I think it is a Win & Win for me and for the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\nFederico Cicciarella",

But I would really like to have one more shot to try and regain my reputation after all that's happened and show love to the Polkadot community by continuing to produce content.\n\nInstead of going for a Small Spender proposal, I think it's better if I show you what I can achieve with less and if you're unhappy, you can reject any future proposals from me and I'll respect your decision.\n\nIf you don't know me, I'm Claudio, Polkadot Ambassador and Crypto Content Creator covering Polkadot under the [KryptosChain](https://www.youtube.com/c/kryptoschain) since the end of 2020 with the very first video in August 2020, you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUL90XgIbCg&ab_channel=KryptosChain) I haven't only done Polkadot content, but also content from other ecosystems from time to time. However, my true love is for the Polkadot ecosystem or I wouldn't have been around for so long!\n\n**My brands:** Youtube - [KryptosChain](https://www.youtube.com/c/kryptoschain)\n\nX - [@KryptosChain](https://twitter.com/KryptosChain)\n\nWithout going into too much detail and to get straight to the point, here is what I propose to do in order to show you that I can achieve good results for the ecosystem:\n\n**Video Content:** **8 videos** @ **$600** each including a professional Video Editor's cost published on both Youtube and X Totalling: **$4,800**\n\n**Ads on X:** Approximately $300 (depending on DOT's price at the time of receiving the payment if successful) will be spent on X ads for each of these videos in a campaign running for a couple of days for each of the 8 videos for around ~$37.5 per video.\n\n**What videos will I do?**\n\n1.  Tutorial on how to use Polkadot's XCM and cross-chain transfer from one Parachain to another to show the benefits of doing it.\n2.  Tutorial of AssetHub and how someone can create assets on there.\n3.  Explain what is Moonbeam Network (including coverage of their open governance).\n4.  Explain what is Astar Network - Also how it became popular in Japan.\n5.  Explain what is Subsocial and showcase the only social media platform of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n6.  Explain HydraDX and all the benefits it offers the Polkadot ecosystem.\n7.  Explain Polkadot's Open Governance and why delegation is important when you stake but don't vote!\n8.  Explain EnergyWebX and how it can support enterprise energy-sector applications using Polkadot's tech!\n\nThanks for your vote and if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me either here on Polkassembly, on X or on Telegram with the username @KryptosChain\n\nP.S - I really hope ShadowGavin 😀 will support this time (fingers crossed) 🤞",

It is our hope that with the support this tip receives it would push Adam to pursue his own ventures and ideas. The amount of $400 per episode was selected as it was the asking amount per episode in KryptosChain's proposal that would have passed if it weren't for KryptosChain's repeated self-harm. We're proposing to give the full cost per episode directly to Adam. You can see all 12 episodes of Dot Take here: https://www.youtube.com/@KryptosChain/streams",

      "content": "**Proposer:** DECENTRALISEDCHAIN\n\n**Address:** 14rQMB1XA8RAK7hhAung8wDBG5LV7ebwkQXtCVD6WQFBnYaZ\n\n**Contact:** @Decentralised\\_C on X (This account has been verified and is mapped to the official X account to prove legitimacy)\n\n**Duration:** ~ 3 weeks after payment is received (estimated on Nov 24th)\n\n**Amount:** $1,650 (310.02 DOT with DOT price at $5.322 EMA7)\n\n**Team:** Firoz\n\n**About:** In January 2018, Firoz launched his cryptocurrency YouTube channel, DecentralisedChain. Employing a blend of educational and news-oriented content, Firoz takes a straightforward approach in his videos. He distills the latest crypto news and market trends, offering insights into potential market movements based on input from professional crypto traders. However, the growth of his channel has been somewhat constrained due to a reduction in video production during the recent bear market. Given this trajectory, we identify him as a low impact content creator on Youtube for Polkadot's marketing initiative.\n\nYoutube channel: [DecentralisedChain](https://www.youtube.com/c/decentralisedchain) 8,456 subscribers\n\nX profile: [@Decentralised\\_C](https://twitter.com/Decentralised_C) 2,743 followers\n\nDecentralisedChain has amassed 2.7k views in the past 28 days, with an impressive average watch time of 5 minutes and 50 seconds, reflecting a robust audience retention rate exceeding 50%. These statistics, visible in the screenshot below, are considered valuable for sustaining audience engagement. The standout video for DecentralisedChain is the \"Staking Solana for Best Returns,\" created two years ago, which has garnered an impressive 46,000 views. Recognizing the potential, PolkaMarketing believes that a similarly structured video explaining how Nova Wallet operates on Polkadot could attract more users to stake their DOT, leveraging the wallet's user-friendly features.  \n  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/Wc2zsWC/Decentralised-Chain-Stats.jpg)\n\n**Description:**\n\nI am pursuing funding to produce three videos that I anticipate will provide significant value to my audience and effectively showcase Polkadot, ultimately generating a substantial impact within the current Polkadot community and enhancing the brand's visibility. After all, what is a brand with exceptional technology if it lacks a thriving user base?\n\nThe videos I will create are (titles may be subject to change):\n\n**1\\. What is Polkadot?** - In this video, we will delve into Polkadot as a brand, exploring its offerings and accomplishments since 2020. Additionally, we will discuss the features of Polkadot 2.0, focusing on its coretime functionalities. Cardano's recent announcement expressing the intention to develop on Polkadot's framework, Substrate, will also be highlighted, showcasing its technological capabilities.\n\n**2\\. Top 3 Parachains on Polkadot** - In this video, we'll elucidate how the impressive technology of Polkadot has inspired the formation of the top three teams, leading them to construct innovative layer 1 blockchains (parachains) with exceptional products. We'll explore how these endeavors contribute to advancing the Polkadot narrative, drawing in users and new builders, thereby fostering the ecosystem's growth.\n\n**3\\. Best Polkadot mobile wallet** - In this tutorial, we'll explore Nova wallet, which we consider the current premier mobile wallet for the Polkadot ecosystem. This user-friendly wallet facilitates seamless transactions, staking, and interaction with other dApps within the ecosystem established by both layer 1 blockchains and layer 2 dApps. The wallet's efficiency has already attracted a substantial user base, and our video aims to further contribute to its popularity.\n\nThe overall expense for the outlined tasks amounts to $1,500, and my objective is to finish this work within approximately three weeks upon receiving the payment. I plan to deliver an average of one video every week during this timeframe.\n\n**Disclaimer:** Under the recent guidelines established by Giotto, the PolkaMarketing agency is entitled to a 10% fee for successfully onboarding the DecentralisedChain brand to promote Polkadot. The agency's role includes advancing the Polkadot marketing narrative and overseeing the entire process on behalf of DecentralisedChain. While DecentralisedChain is dedicated to delivering the content promptly upon receiving payment, it's essential to note that no formal contract has been officially executed between the two brands. PolkaMarketing are currently operating in good faith with the expectation that the content delivery will proceed as planned. If this proposal was to be rejected, PolkaMarketing would respect the community's decision and would not be receiving any fee and thus the onboarding work was for free and as a community service.",

      "content": "**Event date:** 5-6. October, 2023\n\n**Requested budget:** 1,500 USD\n\n**Description:**  This year marked the 20th jubilee edition, and a group of Polkadot ambassadors, namely Six, Gabo, and Viktor, managed to attend and represent Polkadot with a booth at the two-day-long event.\n\n#HACKTIVITY is the biggest information security event of its kind in Central & Eastern Europe. About 1300+ visitors come from all around the globe every year to learn more about the latest trends of cybersecurity, get inspired by people with similar interests and develop themselves via presentations and comprehensive workshop sessions. Many rust developers, hackers and ethusiasts are present on each event. This is why we decided to bring Polkadot there, as the Web3 flagship project.\n\n\n**Our achievements**\n\n- We engaged in lengthy conversations with all the individuals who visited our booth, and as a result, many of them expressed interest in the Polkadot Ambassador program. Additionally, we shared fundamental information about web3 as a whole and explained how Polkadot aligns with this vision.\nFrom the web3 space, only Polkadot Hungary and ETH Hungary were represent at the event.\n\n- We prepared and decorated the dedicated space with roll-ups and also t-shirts from DOTPrague, which we had the chance to bring home to our community with the approval of the Czech Polkadot team, along with some other \"leftover\" merchandise from our previous events. The KODA team was delighted to see their swag distributed to people, which helped raise awareness for Polkadot and their project as well.\nOn the first day, Six conducted a workshop titled \"Web3 Hacking Through CCTF Workshop,\" which had a full room with 15 attendees.\n\n- We set up a QR code linked to a Cognito Form page where we included 7 simple questions, including inquiries about the Polkadot Ambassador program and the Developer Hero Program. We also engaged in conversations with everyone who visited us at the booth, discussing Polkadot in general. The crowd was predominantly tech-savvy, but what stood out was that most of them had never heard of Polkadot and were barely familiar with web3. This presented a great opportunity to promote the web3 space, with a particular focus on Polkadot.\n\n- We successfully promoted our upcoming Hackathon in December and garnered interest from potential participants.\n\n- Additionally, we successfully showcased a brief Polkadot related video between presentations. You can also access this video with the Google Drive link.\n\n\n**Budget**\n\n- We calculated our expenses based solely on our dedicated time for attending and representing Polkadot. Our hourly rate matched what we had at the DOTPrague event, which was $20 USD per hour, which covers our transportation as well.\n\n- We did not incur any additional costs for the provided decorations and swag items.\n\n- Furthermore, we were able to secure the booth for free due to our positive relationship with the event organizers.\n\n\n**We dedicated a total of 25 hours per ambassador to this two-day event, including preparation, which amounts to $500 USD per person, resulting in a combined total of $1,500 USD.**\n\nYou can find pictures from the booth and results/feedback from attendees in the xls: [Polkadot Booth](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G-Zk90rmewrQ4htoz0KTYjavRL25ai_c)\n\nYou can find official pictures from the event at the following link: [Hacktivity 2023](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XKcI8jaQ2cvWzKpv9OI2k02_dI6mYtmu)\n\nYou can find the aftermovie from the event: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TdK3ZGMZb0",

      "content": "Hey, everyone!\n\nPhunky here. Although I doubt there is anyone who does not know Leemo, I hope that you don't mind while I enumerate the reasons he is deserving of this tip from our entire community:\n\n1) Virtually anyone within the walls of ChaosDAO will attest that Leemo was the impetus and driving force for our strong pivot toward OpenGov. He quickly realized its promise and began attempting to educate others about the new system before it launched on Kusama. This was his first \"[long-winded explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcqOTNzmGr0)\". You can also see additional videos demystifying concepts such as the decision period.\n\n2) He has been a long time educator about our entire ecosystem, as it was many of his videos (along with Tommi's and Jay's) that I was watching in the early part of 2021. This adds to the credibility of my position that this reward is long overdue.\n\n3) Beyond his role as Chief Nice Officer for Novasama Technologies, anyone who knows Leemo personally knows he is a true gem, always willing to help others and constantly encouraging people to get involved in our ecosystem and its novel OpenGov mechanism for on-chain decisions\n\nOn a final note, I will admit that I consider Leemo a very good friend and thereby my judgment is biased. But I believe he has consistently demonstrated his capacity for leadership in our ecosystem. In my mind, he is the epitome of what it means to be an \"Ecosystem Agent\" and it is for these reasons, as well as those above, that I hope you consider a vote of AYE to offer this small token of recognition for an all around gigachad.\n\nGratefully,\n\nPhunky",

We'll request funds every 4 videos. Thus always keeping the delivery in the first place and ordering after reaching the goals.\nOur Links:\n\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/vdscripto \n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@vdscripto\n\nMedium: https://medium.com/@verbodasabedoria\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/verbodasabedoria\n\n**Why portuguese speakers and Brazil?**\n\nBrazil has stood as one of the world's leading economies, and in 2022, the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amounted to a staggering BRL 9.9 trillion. This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil's importance on the global economic stage.\n\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil's GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/198/original/photo1696953973_%282%29.jpeg?1697562431)\n\n**Brazil and Crypto:**\n\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\n\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\n\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November..\n\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership.Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/199/original/photo1696953973_%283%29.jpeg?1697562479)\n\n**Context of the proposal:**\n\nRetroactive funding for 11 videos made between the periods of July 26th to October 10th 2023, the amount requested for this big tips would be 700 DOT for the 11 videos, every 4 videos we intend to bring a retroactive request for delivery, with statistical and informative data.\n\n\n1- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj4CaDy_GEk - [REPOST] Teddy DAO\n\n2- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rpNI_Bq0A - [REPOST] Golpes X Projetos\n\n3- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmiLm_0tb9o - [REPOST] ⭐️ Formando os\n\n4- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3xLWuDD_u0 - [REPOST] Onde Encontrar\n\n5- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veXEyDni18w - RMRK: Desafios e Potencial\n\n6- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp_G3wmPwZQ - Temporada de Eventos\n\n7- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wedw3CFueXc - Tokens Destravados\n\n8- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eriQUjnN8WU - Robert Habermeier\n\n9- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgw8H6cHAeQ - VdS Dubs: Fundador\n\n10- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwy3Q38pIA0 - VdS Dubs: 3 Coisas Hydra\n\n11- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YidvjMR-4SY - VdS Dubs: Caos na Kusama\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/201/original/photo1696953956_%281%29.jpeg?1697562512)\n\n**You can check the entire detailed proposal here:**\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvZysX0dI0AfHi1ZROtfb0m6UAkHVLbCf6GefEbpDLc/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**Metrics and statistics Youtube (26 July - 10 October):**\n\n**Followers (4.177):**\n\n![](https://example.com/your-image.png)\n**Video Statistics:**\nThose are the real views after we reposted the 4 videos.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/82q0qvq/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697214868385.png)\n\n**The metrics below are not 100% accurate, since Youtube provides only the total including the deleted videos we reposted.**\n\n**Views Country Target Top 5:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/203/original/photo1696964600_%281%29.jpeg?1697562594)\n\n**Views Followers/Not Followers:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/205/original/photo1696964853_%281%29.jpeg?1697562630)\n\n**Where Subscribers Come From:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/206/original/photo1696965121_%281%29.jpeg?1697562690)\n\n**Age range of viewers:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/209/original/photo1696965209_%281%29.jpeg?1697562711)\n\n**Gender:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/210/original/photo1696965276_%281%29.jpeg?1697562734)\n\n**Devices:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/214/original/photo1696965784_%281%29.jpeg?1697562801)\n\n**We have a strong community in Telegram ~500 msg’s per day:**\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/cXJSJXN/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215065969.png)\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/qdvYKSf/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215083059.png)\n\n**Twitter Impressions:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/207/full/Analytics-X.png?1697562699)\n\n**About US:**\n\nJohn Rhodel Bartolome - AKA \"Parachainboy\" - Founder Verbo da Sabedoria, Polkadot Senior Ambassador for Brazil, Ambassador of parachains such as: Phala, Oak, Bifrost, Moonbeam, Integritee, Nodle, Crust and Aleph Zero, Content creator, rookie member Polkadot Heroes, director of the Filipino unit at Wagmedia, software engineer, and also with experience producing Polkadot events in Brazil, Blockchain SP, View Party Decoded Curitiba and Blockchain Rio.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/VYGn3fg/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215167493.png)\n\nGabriel Bonugli - AKA \"Gabekoin\" - Polkadot/Kusama Senior Ambassador / Ambassador: Phala, OAK and Polimec also have been contributing as Community Manager, Content Creator, Writer, Translator, member of Kusamigos, marketing specialist and also with experience producing Polkadot events in Brazil, View Party Decoded Curitiba and Blockchain Rio and Curitiba Crypto Day.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/kgcsRDm/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215178018.png)\n\nCarlos Sawaki (CJ)  - I've been studying the markets for 5 years and crypto for almost 3, with some courses also taken in the area.

Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/199/original/photo1696953973_%283%29.jpeg?1697562479)\n\n**Context of the proposal:**\n\nRetroactive funding for 11 videos made between the periods of July 26th to October 10th 2023, the amount requested for this big tips would be 700 DOT for the 11 videos, every 4 videos we intend to bring a retroactive request for delivery, with statistical and informative data.\n\n\n1- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj4CaDy_GEk - [REPOST] Teddy DAO\n\n2- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5rpNI_Bq0A - [REPOST] Golpes X Projetos\n\n3- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmiLm_0tb9o - [REPOST] ⭐️ Formando os\n\n4- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3xLWuDD_u0 - [REPOST] Onde Encontrar\n\n5- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veXEyDni18w - RMRK: Desafios e Potencial\n\n6- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp_G3wmPwZQ - Temporada de Eventos\n\n7- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wedw3CFueXc - Tokens Destravados\n\n8- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eriQUjnN8WU - Robert Habermeier\n\n9- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tgw8H6cHAeQ - VdS Dubs: Fundador\n\n10- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwy3Q38pIA0 - VdS Dubs: 3 Coisas Hydra\n\n11- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YidvjMR-4SY - VdS Dubs: Caos na Kusama\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/201/original/photo1696953956_%281%29.jpeg?1697562512)\n\n**You can check the entire detailed proposal here:**\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvZysX0dI0AfHi1ZROtfb0m6UAkHVLbCf6GefEbpDLc/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**Metrics and statistics Youtube (26 July - 10 October):**\n\n**Followers (4.177):**\n\n![](https://example.com/your-image.png)\n**Video Statistics:**\nThose are the real views after we reposted the 4 videos.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/82q0qvq/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697214868385.png)\n\n**The metrics below are not 100% accurate, since Youtube provides only the total including the deleted videos we reposted.**\n\n**Views Country Target Top 5:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/203/original/photo1696964600_%281%29.jpeg?1697562594)\n\n**Views Followers/Not Followers:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/205/original/photo1696964853_%281%29.jpeg?1697562630)\n\n**Where Subscribers Come From:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/206/original/photo1696965121_%281%29.jpeg?1697562690)\n\n**Age range of viewers:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/209/original/photo1696965209_%281%29.jpeg?1697562711)\n\n**Gender:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/210/original/photo1696965276_%281%29.jpeg?1697562734)\n\n**Devices:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/214/original/photo1696965784_%281%29.jpeg?1697562801)\n\n**We have a strong community in Telegram ~500 msg’s per day:**\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/cXJSJXN/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215065969.png)\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/qdvYKSf/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215083059.png)\n\n**Twitter Impressions:**\n\n![](https://uploaddeimagens.com.br/images/004/639/207/full/Analytics-X.png?1697562699)\n\n**About US:**\n\nJohn Rhodel Bartolome - AKA \"Parachainboy\" - Founder Verbo da Sabedoria, Polkadot Senior Ambassador for Brazil, Ambassador of parachains such as: Phala, Oak, Bifrost, Moonbeam, Integritee, Nodle, Crust and Aleph Zero, Content creator, rookie member Polkadot Heroes, director of the Filipino unit at Wagmedia, software engineer, and also with experience producing Polkadot events in Brazil, Blockchain SP, View Party Decoded Curitiba and Blockchain Rio.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/VYGn3fg/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215167493.png)\n\nGabriel Bonugli - AKA \"Gabekoin\" - Polkadot/Kusama Senior Ambassador / Ambassador: Phala, OAK and Polimec also have been contributing as Community Manager, Content Creator, Writer, Translator, member of Kusamigos, marketing specialist and also with experience producing Polkadot events in Brazil, View Party Decoded Curitiba and Blockchain Rio and Curitiba Crypto Day.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/kgcsRDm/11875-53ade4f2672f47b4beecf868e-1697215178018.png)\n\nCarlos Sawaki (CJ)  - I've been studying the markets for 5 years and crypto for almost 3, with some courses also taken in the area.

Currently, on my YouTube channel you can find two main playlists, one for [Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAPR14k1-zSpznR-HSNYHaqa) and one for [Kusama](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAP3PysUxiwYGW7aHsC60TnN).\n\nIn addition to creating educational content, I have been contributing to the community in different ways: supporting the community by answering questions on the Telegram channels and YouTube; through participation in different events (both as a speaker and as a member of the organizational team); with the creation of events, such as the Decoded 2022 viewing party in Valencia; and the creation of a Nomination Pool on both Polkadot ([Pool #61](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/staking/pools), in the top 5 pools with more staked DOT) and Kusama, among other things.\n\nThe following proposal seeks funding for the production of the next educational content about the Polkadot ecosystem. This proposal is born as an extension in order to continue creating content and offering support to the community. The objective of this proposal is to create an informed, educated and valuable community that knows how to make real use of the network. Given the market situation and the general state of the community, we have decided to reduce both the number of videos to be produced and the budget per video compared to previous proposals.\n\n**What return will the network get with this proposal?**\n1. Truthful and high-quality tutorial videos not made so far in Spanish.\n2. Support to users through social networks and, if the situation requires it, video calls.\n3. More than 100,000 additional DOT staked.\n\n**How will these actions be demonstrated?**\n1. The tutorial videos can be seen on the Cryptonitas YouTube channel, will be freely accessible and can be shared on platforms such as Polkadot Hub and the Polkadot and Kusama groups. We consider that views are not the most important thing about a video, but rather the number of users who use the network thanks to that content. Therefore, its usefulness will be evaluated through a form that will demonstrate the number of wallets that are using the network through our content.\n2. Users who are supported will fill out a form where they can see the quality of care and the effectiveness of the ecosystem's query resolution.\n3. The amount of staked DOT can be verified in the increase in staked DOT of the Cryponitas pool (Pool #61). Additionally, users who have been introduced to staking by Cryptonitas, have been supported, and do not stake through a pool, will send a small amount of DOT to the Cryptonitas wallet which will then be returned to them, simply for the purpose of prove this metric.\n\nWhat do we base on to reach the 100,000 DOT metric?\nThis is approximately the amount obtained in the last 6 months in the Cryptonitas pool.\n\nThe requested amount is divided in 3 installments.\n\nYou can read the discussion post [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1924).\n\n**You can see the full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gdjk6TH4nl6OA0MJe93Ok4uw6NcVVh8RXFfg8Gam2CE/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "[TrackingChain] Bring Adoption for Companies: Building Infrastructure for Web2 Integration (Big Tipper Discussion)",
      "content": "Hello,  \n\nMy name is Federico Cicciarella (https://www.linkedin.com/in/federicocicciarella/), and I have been a Microsoft .Net (C#) developer for about 20 years. In recent years, my passion has shifted towards blockchain technology, specifically focusing on the Polkadot ecosystem. (you can find more information about me in the link below).  \n  \nRecently, I received a grant https://grants.web3.foundation/applications/tracking_chain  and this is a wiki https://github.com/TrackingChains/TrackingChain/wiki\n  \n\n**Amount:**  1000 DOT Around $4,500 (4,5$ for Dot is average of the last 3 months)  \n  \n**Description:**  \nHaving successfully completed the basic functionality of software development for \"Tracking Chain,\" (Milestone 1-2-3 completed and last milestone 4 is in progress) I’m at a crucial phase where I aim to directly introduce our solution to potential clients. I want to demonstrate the tangible value it can bring to their operations. Currently, my target clientele primarily consists of companies in the supply chain and data/document certification sectors.  \n  \nI have already scheduled a demonstration involving three Italian companies, one of which is in the final stages of agreement. This demo is scheduled to take place between October and December. Additionally, I am actively planning more demos with other Web2 companies that I have worked with over the past few years, with hopes of conducting them in early 2024. Moreover, I am exploring opportunities for participation in prominent blockchain and IT events that are regularly held in Italy.  \n  \n\nThe funds will be allocated to cover three essential aspects:  \n\n1. **Travel and Meetings with Potential Clients:** Establishing personal connections with these companies is vital. Travel is necessary to meet with representatives from these businesses, understand their specific needs, and demonstrate how Tracking Chain, through the use of Parachains, can effectively address their challenges. While the companies for which I have planned demos are all located in Italy, some of them are substantial organizations with a presence spanning across Europe. Their engagement has the potential to significantly boost the visibility of the Dot ecosystem and provide practical blockchain technology implementations for various business requirements.\n2. **Server Costs for Demos:** To provide effective and convincing demonstrations of our software, we require a stable and scalable test environment accessible to each individual client throughout the demo phase. The funds will be used to cover server costs and the necessary infrastructure to execute these demonstrations seamlessly.\n3. **Customization of the software to integrate it with the customer's software:** This includes planning and implementing changes in the customer's software to interface with Parachains, deployment, smart contract configuration, wallets, and nodes on the client's chosen blockchain. Tracking Chain is designed to support any EVM-compatible parachains or those that integrate the Contract Pallet. This allows each client to choose the most suitable parachains based on their specific needs. With Tracking Chain, our goal is to guide clients in taking their initial steps within parachains, potentially expanding their use for other purposes in the future (as detailed in the grant link).  \n  \nTo provide an estimate, each demo is expected to require a minimum of six working days, encompassing travel, on-site client presentations, configuration, assistance, and software integration. This equates to approximately $1,500 per demo, based on a daily rate of $250 ($31.25 per hour, assuming an eight-hour workday). Please note that this calculation excludes travel expenses and server costs.  \n  \n- Day 1: (Onsite with Customer) Introduction to blockchain and Web3, highlighting the advantages of choosing Polkadot and Parachains. This day will provide a technical foundation with a focus on Web3 marketing.\n- Day 2: (Onsite with Customer) In-depth exploration of the Polkadot ecosystem, offering a detailed overview of Parachains tailored for technical audiences.\n- Day 3-4: (Onsite with Customer or Remote) A comprehensive case study demonstrating how to integrate company management software with Tracking Chain and Polkadot/Parachains.\n- Day 5: (Onsite with Customer or Remote) Environment setup for the demo.\n- Day 6 until stop the Demo: (Remote) Software modifications/features to commence the demo, ongoing maintenance and monitoring of the demo, and Q&A sessions.  \n  \n  \nPS: These costs cannot be covered by a grant because: \"The Web3 Foundation's Grants Program aims to fund software development and research activities that are beneficial for the ecosystem as a whole. As such, we don't usually fund tangential costs such as business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach, and—for non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits.\"\nFor those interested in delving into the architecture to be implemented or any other questions related to the demo or the Tracking Chain project, I am available to provide further clarification.\n\nThank you.  \nSincerely, Federico Cicciarella\n\n\n",

Youtube channel: 18,745 subscribers Twitter profile: 5,672 followers\n\nYou can find more info about me & my past proposals by checking out the previous treasury proposals: [Ref.37](../referenda/37) (Approved & Delivered) & on Kusama #[Ref.46](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/46) (Approved & Delivered) , #[Ref.38](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/38) (Rejected), #[Ref.201](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/201) (Rejected)\n\n**Description:** KryptosChain ethos has always been to simplify explanations, therefore I have decided to simplify this proposal by adding all the necessary info in this Polkassembly post rather than a separate proposal so as not to bore you.\n\nThis proposal asks the Polkadot Treasury for funding of a total of **15 educational videos** covering Polkadot Open Governance & Polkadot News, all uploaded to the [KryptosChain](https://www.youtube.com/c/kryptoschain) Youtube channel & [KryptosChain](https://twitter.com/KryptosChain) Twitter profile during September & partially October.  \nThe video content will be split as following: \n\n_**$250 per video — 10 Open Governance videos**_ (Polkadot Open Gov only, including early discussions and newly active referendums), all summarized without spending a lot of time with the details, mostly serving existing DOT holders but also new users wanting to learn what Open Gov is about.\n\n_**$200 per video — 5 Polkadot News videos**_ (ecosystem announcements)\n\nPrices have been slightly adjusted to reflect the reality in terms of effort required to produce these videos & the current market conditions. Open Gov being more complex and requiring more effort while news simpler to produce.\n\nHere you can find the live report of where each video will be publicly shared as it's completed or as there's work in progress --> [Live Reporting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/189gHre9D2IfLS6IBUd-Z_nfAWtb_KwlQyV1G9OLBmMI)\n\nThis is a continuation / extension of Ref.37 on Polkadot with more focus towards Open Governance & News rather than interviews & product comparisons, in order to serve the Polkadot community.  \nIf this referendum passes, the plan is to continue on a month to month basis until the community will stop supporting, rather than request funding for a longer period of time at once, therefore the pressure on the Treasury being abolutely minimal from a media perspective.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to drop a comment below as the discussion will be open for 7 days for feedback.\n\nClaudio",

      "content": "Dear Polkadot community,\n\nCollators on System Parachains are provided with minimal rewards for block production and small incentives in terms of transaction fees. This reduces incentives for Collators to act in a favorable manner and they may also be inclined to under-resourcing their hosts to save costs. Collators should receive funding for the provision of their services. Ultimately, this should be provided by the chain in a preferably sustainable manner. Implementation of such a system is a long-term solution. In the medium term, funding for collators can be provided by the respective Treasuries in the form of a bounty. This allows funding to be pre-allocated and independently managed.\n\nBased on [Kusama System Parachains Collator Bounty,](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/20) and [RFC-0007: System Collator Selection](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/7eb2193a1a82818c83be4501c4b2a1e6d343dedb/text/0007-system-collator-selection.md), this proposal is a short-term solution aiming to post-pay monthly operating costs of service providers until a more suitable solution (Bounty) is established.\n\n[Full Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KjThkBTp3nJBF4CAV-Jn8fA0PUrd2Lbhy7DOrVHISX0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe proposal aims to secure 6,075.79 DOT for Collators on the Polkadot System Parachains network for services delivered for the period of 2 months - 08-09/2023.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/SxYzWvZ/Screenshot-2023-09-11-at-10-25-19.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/t2pJHWM/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-12-53-37.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NN0c7zG/Screenshot-2023-09-15-at-12-52-13.png)\n\nThis discussion will be open for a period of one week before submitting the proposal onchain. We encourage the Polkadot community to review this proposal and provide any feedback or suggestions.\n\nThank you!\n\n\\*Update 11/09: Parity Collators excluded from the funding proposal. Updated the document with new verified identities.",

      "content": "I have proposed [RFC14 - Improve locking mechanism for parachains](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/14) and it has been accepted by the Fellowship. I have also completed the [implementation for RFC14.](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1290)\n\n**Summary for RFC 14:**\n\nThis RFC proposes a set of changes to the parachain lock mechanism. The goal is to allow a parachain manager to self-service the parachain without root track governance action.\n\nThis is achieved by remove existing lock conditions and only lock a parachain when:\n\n— A parachain manager explicitly lock the parachain\n\n— OR a parachain block is produced successfully\n\n**Motivation for RFC14**\n\nThe manager of a parachain has permission to manage the parachain when the parachain is unlocked. Parachains are by default locked when onboarded to a slot. This requires the parachain wasm/genesis must be valid, otherwise a root track governance action on relaychain is required to update the parachain.\n\nThe current reliance on root track governance actions for managing parachains can be time-consuming and burdensome. This RFC aims to address this technical difficulty by allowing parachain managers to take self-service actions, rather than relying on general public voting.\n\nThe key scenarios this RFC seeks to improve are:\n\n1\\. Rescue a parachain with invalid wasm/genesis.\n\nWhile we have various resources and templates to build a new parachain, it is still not a trivial task. It is very easy to make a mistake and resulting an invalid wasm/genesis. With lack of tools to help detect those issues1, it is very likely that the issues are only discovered after the parachain is onboarded on a slot. In this case, the parachain is locked and the parachain team has to go through a lengthy governance process to rescue the parachain.\n\n2\\. Perform lease renewal for an existing parachain.\n\nOne way to perform lease renewal for a parachain is by doing a least swap with another parachain with a longer lease. This requires the other parachain must be operational and able to perform XCM transact call into relaychain to dispatch the swap call. Combined with the overhead of setting up a new parachain, this is an time consuming and expensive process. Ideally, the parachain manager should be able to perform the lease swap call without having a running parachain2.",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nThank you for your assistance with helping to close and refund deposits associated with governance 1.0 proposals. When [the proposal](73) was initiated there were already four (4) proposals already seeking reimbursement, to avoid double spends these refunds were excluded from the batch.\n\nNow that these referenda have concluded without success I am inclined to also request refunds for their deposits to be equitable.\n\nThis proposal seeks to refund **RADIUMBLOCK.COM** (13GtCixw3EZARj52CVbKLrsAzyc7dmmYhDV6quS5yeVCfnh1) with 500 DOT for their [original proposal](../treasury/284). The rejected proposal can be found [here](34).\n\n**Disclaimer & Context**: This particular effort to refund participants is limited in scope to those who had proposals on the spend queue at the onset of Open Gov on Polkadot. A coordinated effort was required to avoid potential duplicate returns of deposits. If you feel aggrieved due to a proposal outside the scope of this exercise I suggest that you open an independent referenda.",

I am asking for the grant to compensate for the efforts to develop the Russian Speaking community, administrate the community, inviting dozens of new ambassadors and senior ambassadors, talented developers and activists, translating and delivering the key messages and do all needed for Polkadot success.\n\n**About my work and contributions, that I am part of:**\n\nSome of our key milestones for the whole period:\n\nPolkadot related articles published on Medium 10+ In collaboration with PromoTeam\n\nI hosted online event - 22+ [https://www.crowdcast.io/promoteam](https://www.crowdcast.io/promoteam) as well as Telegram voice sessions, Twitter voice sessions and Clubhouse rooms\n\nOffline events hosted or helped to organize - 3 big events in Moscow , 3 events in Tashkent (Uzbekistan), 2 in Belgrade (Serbia).\n\nI participate as a producer and scenarist of PromoTeam YouTube Channel - 40+ videos including Hot Dot News, interviews with 7 founders, Parachain News and DOT Features.\n\n**Social media**\n\nTelegram PromoTeam RU 1800+ [https://t.me/PromoTeamRus](https://t.me/PromoTeamRus)\n\nTelegram PromoTeam announcements 1300+ [https://t.me/promoteam\\_ann](https://t.me/promoteam_ann)\n\nTelegram PolkadotRU 2400+ [https://t.me/PolkadotRu](https://t.me/PolkadotRu)\n\nMedium Polkadot 900+ [https://medium.com/polkadot-network-russia](https://medium.com/polkadot-network-russia)\n\nMedium PromoTeamPD 525 [https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/settings/followers](https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/settings/followers)\n\nT**otal russian speaking audience 7k+ (icreased from 0,3k in 2019 to 7k+ in 2023 )**\n\n**Medium**\n\n[https://medium.com/polkadot-network-russia](https://medium.com/polkadot-network-russia) - members of PromoTeam and other Polkadot Ambassadors translating the articles to this blog on monthly basis\n\nPolkadot Ecosystem PromoTeam 516 subs [https://alexpromoteam.medium.com/](https://alexpromoteam.medium.com/) Alex PromoTeam 197 subs\n\nMy most viewed article on Medium - [What is Polkadot Parachain Auction and how it will reveal the hidden power of the Polkadot… - 14,5k views](https://medium.com/polkadot-ecosystem-promoteam/what-is-polkadot-parachain-auction-and-how-it-will-reveal-the-hidden-power-of-the-polkadot-f4fc5edc3d20)\n\n**Crowdcast**\n\n[https://www.crowdcast.io/promoteam](https://www.crowdcast.io/promoteam)\n\n**Ambassadors activity & other activities** \n\nInterviews hosted with ambassadors candidates New candidates and ambassadors, senior ambassadors onboarded  55+\n\n**Russian Meetup.com and Developers community**\n\nThe biggest Russian Blockchain on Meetup by PromoTeam [Meetup.com community](https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/russian-blockchain-community/) 2,3k members\n\n[Ru developers in the Dotsama](https://t.me/substrate_dev_ru) (increased 2-3x last years) Total Russian Speaking developers 600+\n\n**I am not only helping the Polkadot itself but help to develop the whole ecosystem, that's why we also support:**\n\nUnique Network RU - 1700+ subs\n\nAstar Network RU - 2000+ subs\n\nBifrost RU - 500+ subs\n\n**I am the validator of Polkadot / Astar / Kusama and other networks. I** help new nominators and validators to get into the ecosystem.\n\n**Let’s break down the numbers**\n\nI am asking 2500 DOT for the 3+ years of previous contributions in different ways to the Polkadot and to create a new options to motivate new candidates and ambassadors to get quik tips for their little contributions. In the following estimated calculations, I average the price of 30$ USD per hour, as it’s hard to calculate the exact price for each piece of work, and I cover the cost of all steps of production and activities myself. I spend at least 1-2 hours of my time every day  (estimate 500-700h + per year ) to help and consulate people in the Russian speaking community, produce some content, or administrate the chats . I do it because I am a fan and I like Polkadot and what we are doing. But with this grant I can increase the quality and spend more resources to execute these activities, pay for some assistance and so on. So I will really appreciate it if the community will support my 3,5+ years of work with this grant. It will help me operate more effectively. I am asking this grant also to have some resources to quickly tip talented ambassadors and candidates and inspire them to research the Polkadot.\n\n“Support those who already contribute!”",

I'm an ex-Database Developer who developed a passion for content creation in Web3 and have started a Youtube channel in April of 2018 with the scope to share my research with other crypto enthusiasts as well as use my tech knowledge to do tutorials and try and explain users something techier in a non tech way.\n\nAs Polkadot launched in 2020, I started doing media coverage about the ecosystem and have since been doing mostly that.\n\nI had previously raised a proposal (not for my main KryptosChain channel) in January 2023 which had passed public voting and which is [#Ref.46](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/46) and has since been delivered. You can find the final delivery report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12kPiNeT9Zpc5xn3HXWgsaeM7YGRJV5dEL-97Uohf3_4). This was an initiative to grow a Romanian community who didn't have any content available about Polkadot.\n\nWhile delivering the proposal for #Ref.46 I had continued to produce content on my main channel, KryptosChain including interviews with Founders from the Polkadot ecosystem without requesting additional funding from the Treasury and had been managed within that budget as the KSM price had performed very well between referendum start date and receiving the funds and I felt it was only normal to do that for the community.\n\nThis new proposal is to request treasury funding for continued support of the ecosystem through media marketing.\n\nTo produce a total of 25 videos over a period of 2 months of the following types:\n\n5 x Comparison videos between the Cosmos & Polkadot ecosystems\n(Compare products such as DEFI dApps, wallets and NFT marketplaces from the above ecosystem to those on Polkadot and talk about the pros & cons)\n\nGeneral Polkadot ecosystem news x 5 videos\n\nOpen Governance news regarding treasury spends x 5 videos (on Polkadot only)\n\nInterviews with Founders / Co-Founders or other team members x 10 videos\n\nYou can find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZYLw9M9LIb3H0t8caqY5cRRD5bjxMAgrVGPNhutTPiM/edit)\n\nThere has been no discussion opened as this is a Big Tipper request and not a Spender, thus it's for a short period of time.\n\nThe requested amount is **932.45 DOT** , worth approximately **$4,625 @ $4.96** per **DOT** at today's market price. Should the price of DOT appreciate within the 7 days + the additional days before the payment from the treasury is sent, I will be transferring the extra DOT back to the Treasury. Should the price drop, I will work with what I got and should it drop by a lot, I will be requesting an additional top-up to make up for it in a separate proposal (Let's hope it won't be needed).\n\nI look forward to your feedback over these next 7 days of the referendum.\n\nRegards,\n\nClaudio\n\n",
