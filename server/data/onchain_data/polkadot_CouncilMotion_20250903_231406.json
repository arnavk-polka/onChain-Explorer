      "content": "> This is a follow up proposal to what we submitted before:\n[#151 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot & Westend & Rococo Networks](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/151)\n\n\n**Overview**\n\nSubscan is an essential block explorer and analytics tool for the Polkadot network, providing valuable insights to the Polkadot community. However, the maintenance and operation of Subscan requires a significant investment of resources, including server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Therefore, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fee for Subscan from July to December 2022 from the Polkadot treasury to ensure its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\n**Total**\n\nWe believe that this reimbursement proposal will help to ensure the continuous operation and maintenance of Subscan, and benefit the growth and development of the Polkadot network. This time, we plan to apply for a total of 190,244 USD in Polkadot, the amount of DOT will be converted based on the EMA7 price on the day of the official submission.\n\nBilling details can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13whK83g_MXYCfQ4WyJmQuM_aTclCGsB9Ww9Pq3lP6dY/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n",

      "content": "Polkadot Decoded’s Flagship event will be held at the end of June 2023 at the Øksnehallen in Copenhagen. This is the biggest yearly conference focused on all things Polkadot. It brings together the Polkadot community, web3 enthusiasts, new/curious DOT holders, and builders to hear about developments in the Polkadot ecosystem. To align with the global Flagship event and continue the excitement with the regional focus at the strategic local markets of the Polkadot community, a grand satellite event covering the Asian region ( China, Japan, Korea, Singapore and the rest of SEA) will be held on July 15th and July 16th at Shanghai/China (exact location is TBD and the dates will align with the rest of the regional satellite events).\n\nThe 2023 Decoded China event will therefore create pivotal experience to the fast growing Polkadot China community and the nearby markets such as Korea, Japan, Singapore, Vietnam and the rest of SEA. The China satellite event will feature presentations, panels, workshops, demos and aligned regional events (i.e. regional hackathon), delivered in the language of Chinese or English. The latest update and news of the Polkadot ecosystem teams, Parity, the Web3 Foundation and the community KOLs from Asia will be shared. The event is focusing on the content curated for a higher-level and border audience, as well as for decision makers, investors, entrepreneurs and Web3 Medias.\n\nThe target audience will be crossing over all six of our target personas: Business Decision Maker, Technical Decision Maker, both from startups and Enterprises interested in Polkadot, Builders from teams in the Polkadot ecosystem, DOT Holders, Developer, Polkadot enthusiasts and supporters. Polkadot Decoded China aims to be a general assembly for all things Polkadot/Kusama happening in Asia with a main focus of the China market.\n\nAlong with one main stage with the presentations, demos, panels and flagship event (Decoded Copenhagen) highlight playbacks, 2023 Decoded China satellite event will have networking areas, private meeting areas, exhibition areas (for parachain and ecosystem teams) and one after-party to celebrate with the community. The China satellite event aims to have between 300-500 attendees, 25 speaking slots (presentations, demos, panels and Copenhagen highlight session playbacks are all included), 20 exhibition booths (for selected parachain teams and the Substrate-based ecosystem projects), and one Substrate job fair.\n\nThe 2023 Polkadot Decoded China satellite event will be facilitated and hosted by Aitijia’er, an event agency based in China, who produced the 2020 Web3 Form @ Shanghai (Web3 rebranded towards China due to the regulation concern) and 2022 Decoded China @ Hangzhou.\n\nMore details of the proposal, please see this link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gn64J66dlZLheQxNa1R19AOqdkyboxn1vHyUOD1rmPw/edit#)",

USD$104,000 ~ 19,866.2846 DOT\n\n**Proponent:** EasyA 5FQqvRHgBEUZG17qs9cNFH6ZSSVyAwhb7D6dKjGWb8xgKFkP\n\n\nHey Everyone!\n\nWe’re delighted to give a full update on our progress so far!\n\n**Progress Summary**\n\nIn summary, we have now successfully achieved Milestone 1 and Milestone 2! We started by opening this educational opportunity to more parachains/projects and preparing the full content framework. We have now collected key feedback from developers and parachain/project teams and utilised it to create the content for the challenges. We have also created a totally new design and UX for the Polkadot challenges to make them stand out. We are in the very final stages of approving all the content to go live in the app for release. \n\nWe’re super excited that on the IRL hackathons side, we have also finalised the hackathon dates and locations. We have been inviting key developer groups and Polkadot parachains to attend the hackathon and will be leveraging our connections with core blockchain clubs to ensure a brilliant pipeline of builders at the hackathons!\n\nOur next step is to make a huge push to get everyone building on Polkadot in the run-up to the IRL hackathons. We’re currently working with the participating parachains/projects on a detailed social media and activations strategy!\n\n**Full Progress Report**\n\nWe have written up the fully comprehensive progress report for Milestones 1 and 2 [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tvSCM9w8fSKxUBgTIuXNbhrdNWZUzpQHtORZxtyVAKE/edit?usp=sharing) for the community!\n\n**Milestone 2 Requested Allocation Breakdown**\n\nWe would therefore like to request our Milestone 2 allocation so that we can proceed to Milestone 3 (hosting the 2 hackathons). \n\nDetails for this milestone were discussed in our original discussion post [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1585), with the precise milestone and allocation breakdown [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyip_eVdevsjijQQSkL_GPOE5YF-AEGgE_xhwCFLnt0/edit#bookmark=id.x3kscjjklocs). Our first milestone was approved (and second milestone request discussed) [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/353).\n\nWe're already seeing huge excitement around #60DaysOfPolkadot and can’t wait to see what everyone builds at the hackathons! See you there!",

This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing reliable infrastructure services\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how nodes are running, what calls are causing errors, and where traffic is originating from\n\nService Details\n===============\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, we've made a large number of stability improvements to our Ultimate API service to allow us to add a large number of new parachains over the last quarter as well as support for multiple chains outside of Polkadot.\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we've been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. Geolocation insights provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now automatically upsize the storage on nodes to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they've all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Polkadot chains.\n\nBetween 2023-01-01 and 2023-03-31 our Polkadot API service has:\n\n-   Served a total of 4.3 billion responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 50,000 GB of data egress \n\n-   The highest daily total was 62 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Polkadot only\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 49 million responses each day\n\n-   Westend had over 110 million API responses in the period\n\n-   Statemint had over 102 million API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Polkadot is 97,192,546,788 (97 Billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Polkadot, Statemint, Westend, Encointer and Collectives was 99.98%, 99.99%, 99.96%, 99.74%, 99.95% respectively\n\nEnhancements\n------------\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [Auto Expand Storage](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-developer-update-auto-expand-storage-for-dedicated-nodes/) - When the node's storage reaches 85% utilisation, the storage size will be automatically increased by 10%. Saves developers and devOps time on having to constantly check on and manually upgrade their node storage size\n\n-   [Partnership with POKT network](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-partners-with-pocket-network-to-unlock-access-to-unstoppable-infrastructure/) to bring in more external developers into the Polkadot ecosystem\n\n-   [Geographical Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) - API key owners can view statistics about where in the world your community are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives\n\n-   [Clarify our IP address handling](https://blog.onfinality.io/how-does-onfinality-deal-with-personal-information/) - OnFinality does not, and will never, correlate or link specific wallet addresses to the IP address or request origin making the RPC request\n\n-   We're testing access to various unsafe methods like traceBlock and subscribeStorage that will help developers create applications that utilise XCM - contact us if you would like to be part of the beta\n\n-   Reduced our exposure to any single cloud provider - Progressively migrated resources away from AWS to other cloud providers for lower cost and exposure.\n\n-   Expanded our OnFinality for Startups Programme to support teams from the Substrate Builders Programme and Scytale Ventures\n\n-   Added support for a number of new networks, including Ajuna, Unique, Clover, SORA, Composable Finance, Collectives, xx network, as well as Polygon, BNB, Fantom, Gnosis and Evmos from outside the ecosystem. OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/) and [network analytics page](https://onfinality.io/networks).\n\n**Full report can be read here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9LnHNap-81QswfQ2yur80rISJAPcHkVzQfc0U54PNM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9LnHNap-81QswfQ2yur80rISJAPcHkVzQfc0U54PNM/edit?usp=sharing)",

Missing Link has a track record of providing high-quality recruiting services to the blockchain industry, as you can see from the full proposal linked below.\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem continues to expand, it is critical that there are enough skilled developers to support the growth. **We propose to place a total of 15 Rust developers to different companies and projects within the Polkadot ecosystem through three milestones.** Companies who qualify and are in the Polkadot ecosystem can utilize the funds from this treasury proposal to receive recruitment services for Rust developers for their project.\n\nIn total, we are requesting three tranches of $120k USD for a total of $360k USD from the Polkadot treasury to fund this project, with each tranche being awarded before each milestone. We believe that this investment will have a significant impact on the Polkadot ecosystem, by ensuring that there are enough skilled developers to support the growth of the network.\n\nThank you for your consideration of this proposal and we have incorporated the community’s feedback before submitting this proposal on-chain.\n\n[Here is the link to the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zON3bX38D1MXLjaIIdc0aioosxmbQ2IDlMSouM2TLHo) with all the relevant details, processes and qualifiers.",

      "content": "**Proponent:** 12wWLUd5qMzLFGqBsMnHLVFeTuYJwuo5ygMAxuSywrBX1XSF\n\n**Date:** 2023.03.30\n\n**Requested DOT:**  74,785 DOT ($495,000)\n\n**Contact:** William Freudenberger (william@k-f.co)\n\n**Discussion Post:** [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1754](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1754)\n\n---\n\nThe [ongoing discussion](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-update-roadmap/1200/) about automated market makers (AMMs) in the Statemint roadmap is mainly focused on improving the user and custodian experience by allowing small atomic swaps natively and making Statemint a central hub for asset deposits. This addresses important pain points by enabling transaction fees to be paid in non-native tokens and facilitating interaction with the entire asset variety of the ecosystem without requiring to run custom nodes or infrastructure.\n\nHowever, we believe that one aspect has been overlooked: the slow swaps of large volumes, which can be easily front-run or sandwiched. This is particularly relevant in the context of trades proposed through governance for use cases such as\n1. Paying out treasury grants, bounties or even [salaries](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13378) in less volatile currencies (ie. stablecoins).\n2. Enabling parachains to build a DOT reserve which can be used to acquire a parachain lease, pay XCM fees, or [increase availability cores](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/parachain-scaling-by-parablock-splitting/341) during times of high demand (once supported).\n3. Governance deciding to invest part of the treasury into a token to diversify their treasury\n\nWhat we need is the opposite of what a traditional AMM provides: atomic swaps with immediate execution, even in relatively illiquid assets. A governance vote is unable to time the market and is highly predictable. Therefore, executing such a transaction as a market order on an AMM is problematic, as it will be guaranteed to be front-run. A better solution is to \"dollar-cost-average\" over a long period of time making it harder for price manipulation to affect the purchase.\n\nAt Centrifuge, we have researched distinct approaches of how to achieve hard-to-front-run slower transactions. In our opinion, the most elegant solution is [TWAMM (Time Weighted Automated Market Maker](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/07/twamm). We are of the firm conviction that the implementation of this model represents the most efficacious approach for executing token swaps in the context of slower and passive procedures, such as governance.\n\nTWAMM (Time Weighted Automated Market Maker) eliminates front-running vulnerabilities of traditional AMMs when executing large orders, especially in the context of passive procedures, such as governance. The proposed solution will be executed as a seamless extension to [pallet-asset-conversion](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/statemint-e-swap-discussion), thereby enhancing its capabilities as an embedded AMM.\n\nThe deliverables of the proposal contain the TWAMM-pallet,  associated runtime APIs, associated research for further optimizing and extending the pallet, a security audit of the pallet and a frontend.\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://centrifuge.hackmd.io/Q4AZOW2WRPq7Q0Ti3ee8Og?view).\n\n**EDIT**\n* Link discussion post",

      "title": "Proposal: A Survey of the Polkadot Data Ecosystem",
      "content": "**Short description: To create a comprehensive overview of the current state of all things data in the Polkadot ecosystem. Funding includes the research, a Github repo, and a Website.**\n\nHi everyone. This is Tommi, aka Alice und Bob. You might know me from my YouTube channel [Alice und Bob](https://www.youtube.com/@alice_und_bob/videos), where I educate on the edge of edutainment and technology within Polkadot, or from [publicly talking about DeFi in Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGnD3LhpHEI) (and specifically [Mangata Finance](https://www.mangata.finance/), where I lead Growth) or from my [occasional tweets](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob) on the bird app.\n\nEarly last year I did my taxes and started building [Subscrape](https://github.com/ChaosDAO-org/subscrape), a Python scraper for Substrate chain, to help me in the process. Over time, things became more serious and I started building [Polkalytics](https://polkaverse.com/10716/polkalytics-a-google-scale-analytics-service-for-polkadot-37079), a Google-scale analytics service for Polkadot. I have built an indexer for Polkadot that writes the complete chain into Google BigQuery and later derives additional tasks to create account reports for the purpose of filing taxes.\n\nDuring my work, I discovered that there are A LOT of data-related projects in Polkadot, it's just hard to find them at first glance. I had great conversations with people from the Parity Data Team, Apexti, Subwallet, and Apillon, and think that all the people working on data in the ecosystem deserve to be much better connected so that we can make everyone's life easier.\n\nTherefore this submission is a proposal to create a Github repository that contains a survey of the Polkadot Data Ecosystem and an accompanying website. A complete overview of everything that exists in terms of data in Polkadot.\n\nIn preparation for this proposal I opened a [discussion](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1726) and had conversations with the Parity data team, a Polkadot Wiki maintainer and a member from the Subwallet team. There were two primary requests: To publish the work as structured data and to publish the work as website. Therefore I have decided to follow both approaches, disseminate the data in a repo with structured data and then publish a website that embeds the structured data (which will also work as a proof of concept)\n\nI am still open to any feedback and will work to integrate it if it is in line with the intention of this proposal.\n\n[Polkadot Treasury Proposal - A Survey of the Polkadot Data Ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MNxSf6rWOt_z6D884K_QvQpxpwahavHwarA7M79JLmE/edit#)\n\nA companion video for this proposal can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYlpLdnZ8gY).\n\nBest,\nTommi",

In addition to creating educational content, I have been contributing to the community in different ways: supporting the community by answering questions on the Telegram channels and YouTube; through participation in different events (both as a speaker and as a member of the organizational team); with the creation of events, such as the Decoded 2022 viewing party in Valencia; and the creation of a Nomination Pool on both Polkadot and Kusama, among other things.\n\nThis proposal intends to continue the content creation of the [previous proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/213), which includes the production of 85+ pieces of content. The main objective of this proposal is to have an informed, educated and valuable community that knows how to make real and appropriate use of the network.

In addition to the migrations mentioned above, all the migrations included in runtimes since v9380 have been included in this release, allowing to jump over a few runtimes. \n\n- Call Hash: `0x0352127d49a9cb7794251a4caeb9c6b729444f1f40a9ebd2284dfbc168319363`\n- Preimage is submitted.\n\n### Relay Chain\n\nAmong other things, this proposal includes the inclusion of OpenGov on Polkadot. Note that, in order for OpenGov to be fully operational, [the proposal upgrading collectives parachain](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/403) needs to be approved and enacted (this is ongoing). If this happens, Fellowship will be created in the Collectives parachain.

For one, it includes XCM v3.\n\nOn Statemint, this does not include NFT 2.0 or Foreign Assets as the Statemine release does, although with the audits completed these will be in an upcoming release. It does include the new runtime API to [query account balances](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/2455), which will return all the fungible assets (under the Balances pallet and both instances of the Assets pallet) that an account owns in a single RPC call. This should be particularly useful for front end developers.\n\n### External Motion\n\nPlease note this proposal is submitted as an external motion: meaning after/if Council approves, this submission will be up for vote in referenda queue for the community to have the final decision. It is a general expectation, given the size of the upgrade, for the community to vote on this for a complete launch period (28 days). \n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

This release contains the changes from v0.9.41 to v0.9.42. Please note there are 4 runtime migrations for relay chain on this release (details below), in addition to the migrations mentioned above, all the migrations included in runtimes since v9380 have been included in this release, allowing to jump over a few runtimes. Preimage is submitted:\n\n`0x89902130dbc0b878d643e0367f5b9cc85c1b8ac80c4f6cceed9013491177da15`\n\nThis Polkadot system parachain upgrade includes changes since v9370, which has several major updates. For one, it includes XCM v3.\n\nOn Collectives specifically, this update includes the [Technical Fellowship](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/2186). It corresponds to the launch of Open Gov on Polkadot, which is included in the Relay Chain runtime. The Fellowship will manage its membership and referenda voting on the Collectives chain, while sending its decisions (e.g. to whitelist a call for the `WhitelistedCaller` track) in an XCM message to the Relay Chain.\n\nFor specific PRs included on this release, please visit: [https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v9420](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v9420). \n\nThis proposal is submitted as an external motion: meaning if/after Council approves, the community will have the final decision via referenda queue. \n\nMake sure to review and vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "Acala Foundation have registered para id 3336 and won a parachain slot auction by bidding with the intention to use the new lease to renew Acala para lease.\n\nHowever, due to [bug in Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7202), parachain 3336 can never produce valid block and therefore unable to perform lease swap action.\n\nThis proposal aims to perform lease swap between 2000 (Acala) and 3336 (parachain bid by Acala Foundation).\n\n---\n\n## Technical Details\n\nIn order to participate parachain auction, we need to register a parathread, which requires a genesis state and geensis wasm. However, it is time consuming to prepare those as the provided template project is not suitable for production usage and therefore we used a dummy wasm during registration.\n\nOnce we won the auction, we have created a new valid parachain wasm and use [`register.schedule_code_upgrade`](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/15425400-2) and[ `register.set_current_head`](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/15425407-2) to update the genesis wasm and genesis state for para 3336.\n\nThe state and wasm is correctly updated. However, there is an unexpected side effect. Due to bug [polkadot#7202](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7202), this set the upgrade go ahead signal. \n\nWhen the parachain is onboarded, the collator for para 3336 starts try to produce block but it failed with error:\n\n`[Parachain] panicked at 'No new validation function found in storage, GoAhead signal is not expected', /home/build/.cargo/git/checkouts/cumulus-59522f43471fa161/a3d6cd4/pallets/parachain-system/src/lib.rs:396:21`\n\nThis is because parachain received the upgrade go ahead signal and expecting it is during the runtime upgrade process, which is not the case. This caused the inherent to panic.\n\nIt is not possible to rescue the parachain from this state without intervene from relaychain and therefore we proposed this propsoal.",

      "title": "Grabber, a tool that incentivizes experts and leaders within the community to boost governance engagement and voter activity.",
      "content": "Dear Polkadot Community! \nWe are submitting a proposal for a governance incentivization tool, that helps incentivize experts and leaders within the community to boost governance engagement and voter activity.\n\n**[Get the detailed Proposal here >>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit)**\n\n### **Overview**\nWhile the concept of cryptocurrencies can be considered validated, the concept of cryptocurrency governance is still evolving. The objective of “basic” cryptocurrency governance (as a decentralized management system for that particular cryptocurrency ecosystem) is to perform decentralized control over the process, support developments, and manage the ecosystem's existence. The main goal is to ensure the long-term sustainability, security, and adaptability of a network while increasing the wealth locked in the ecosystem and the holdings of its participants, which are directly connected to the ecosystem's overall wealth. “Basic” cryptocurrency governance refers to the “tactical” decision-making processes. It helps address critical issues such as protocol upgrades, funding for development, conflict resolution, and network security. Even at this level, governance encounters numerous issues and opportunistic behavior from users, such as fraud, Sybil attacks, vote borrowing, voting manipulation, and participants' opportunism, among others. \n\nPolkadot's governance model is designed to prioritize the growth and development of the platform's ecosystem, rather than focusing solely on partnerships or marketing. This strategic approach stems from Polkadot's L0 vision as a foundation for future Layer 1 (L1) blockchains and its Substrate framework, which simplifies the process of building and deploying customized blockchains (also platform).\nWe can refer to Polkadot governance as \"builders\" governance, which emphasizes the platform's commitment to nurturing and supporting the creation of a robust ecosystem. This type of governance fosters collaboration and innovation within the community by allocating resources from the treasury to projects that contribute to the platform's growth, enhance its functionality, or expand its capabilities. In essence, \"builders\" governance concentrates on strategic objectives rather than tactical ones, prioritizing the development and evolution of the ecosystem over merely maintaining its current state. This approach ensures that Polkadot continues to evolve and adapt, making it a more resilient and future-proof platform that can support a diverse range of blockchain applications and use cases.\n\nPolkadot's governance requires voters to have deep expertise and take on significantly higher risks, both within the large ecosystem and the market as a whole. Additionally, due to the break in cause-and-effect relationships, voters must make decisions without the possibility of receiving feedback or personal benefits. Furthermore, voters must also lock up their funds in the process. This is an important aspect of the system, as it helps to ensure voters' commitment and alignment with the long-term interests of the ecosystem. \n[You can learn more about \"builder\" governance in our proposal >>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit#)\n\nHowever, it can be confidently said that one of the biggest challenges of this type of DAO is the enormous amount of time that needs to be spent collectively on studying community proposals. If we assume that each proposal takes 5.5 hours for adequate study (the average time spent on studying a scientific paper by an expert), then 1000 voters will spend 5,500 hours on a single proposal (excluding those who could not handle it, did not study it, or did not vote).\nThen 20 proposals will take up 110,000 hours. That is 68+ full-time experts working on this exclusively.\nHence, an obvious task is to reduce the time it takes for a community member to study one proposal. The organization and simplification, preferably with added interest, can be improved in the scheme of such governance.\n\nThere are several ways to lower the barrier to entry for studying proposals and increase the chances of engaging a voter:\n- Train the required number of voters  \n- Delegate votes to the most motivated members, who are ready to do deep research \n- Add formal proposal compliance analyses\n- Provide volunteer analyses and reports.\n\n[Each of these solutions has its pros and cons, and you can learn more about them by following the link >>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit#)\n\n\n### **The ideal concept proposes the following solution**\nDrawing from existing experience, we can create a decentralized group of competing experts who can generate reviews of proposals. Their work will significantly reduce the need for ordinary voters to deeply engage with proposals, as they will be able to prepare reports that allow for direct insight. Decentralization and competition will facilitate the formation of diverse opinions and prevent an unconstructive approach. Moreover, these experts can become vote delegates who are also in competition. This work should be minimally incentivized, as reviewers provide a public good.\n\n### **Grabber incentivization challenge concept.**\nTo implement commitment, user reputation, and actual actions and delegation of allocations and payments, have a reputation system within the system. It will be able to collect and analyze experts in the system and commitment. Based on this reputational tool, collective incentivization can work: bounties will be allocated, for which different experts will compete. Users will be able to vote on whose impact was more useful to them, thereby distributing the bounty. The results of their voting will again generate on-chain events that will enrich the participants' reputations.\nThe general scheme of work will be as follows:\n\n1. For each proposal, a research budget is allocated, which allows compensation for researchers' expenses (bounty). For this, an event with conditions is created in the system.\n2. Researchers can register in the system and conduct research, uploading links to them in the interface. Research is done within a specific timeframe.\n3. After that, the proposed posts are reviewed, and points are assigned. Together with the relevance of their experience, they receive accruals from the allocated fund. When considering the researcher's relevance, it is visible how often they vote/voted/parachain auctions/funds in the system, etc.\n4. The experience of researchers improves with the number of payments they receive (this is also collected on-chain and displayed).\n5. The result is deep, non-formal research from multiple authors, which significantly reduces the workload for the community.\n\n\n\n### **Grabber: A tool with an experienced team and Polkadot traction.**\n\nTeam:\nDev: Experienced with RUST, WASM/EVM (DOT) smart-contracts, Polkadot.js, and Polkadot features.\nCommunity: Well-connected in the Polkadot community, with existing DOT/eco communities event traction and a large existing community.\n\n### **Battle-tested flow**\n\nWe already have:\n1.

And it's back for its fourth edition on June 28th and 29th, 2023, with a fully hybrid experience of online and in-person events. Decoded aims to evolve into a general assembly for all things Polkadot/Kusama.\n\nIn 2023 we will come to Copenhagen, Denmark with an increased capacity and there will be simultaneous satellite events hosted regionally in the USA, Europe, LatAm and China in July. These satellite events are aimed to be regionally focused. Whereas the Flagship event will be globally focused.\n\nThe program line up will be featuring presentations, panels, workshops, demos, fireside and barcamp chats. We are focusing on curating content that is more high-level for a broader audience as well as attracting decision makers and enterprises into the room. The target audience will be crossing over all six of our target personas: Business Decision Maker, Technical Decision Maker, both from startups and Enterprises interested in Polkadot, Builders from teams in the Polkadot ecosystem, DOT Holders, Developer, Polkadot enthusiasts and supporters. Polkadot Decoded aims to be a general assembly for all things Polkadot/Kusama. However, we are mainly focusing on decision makers and enterprises.\n\nFurther information on the proposal, including milestones, budget, agenda, participants and more can be found under this [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OgE-hsNGepFpN-xgLDG1x5cHWJ55ltYroMGHaQnYQM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis is the 2nd tranche request.

      "content": "After the submission of [referendum 112](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/democracy/referendum/112), seeking to increase the validator active set to 500, the community discussed the possibility and the need of Polkadot increasing the validators set. \n\nFeedback from the proposals indicates two points:\n\n- There's interest with increasing the number of validators of the active set **but with increments**;\n\n- There needs to be some analysis on the effects of the increase to ensure there's no security concerns.\n\nThe results indicate that participating members would like to increase the active set to 400 with increments of 5 per era. They believe that this increase would not compromise the security of the chain and allow for natural (opportunistic) leveling as the set increases. Core developers have also agreed on similar increases by value: \n\n“With increasing to 500, the amount of DOT needed to acquire a validator will sharply reduce from 1.7 mDOT now, to just around 370 kDOT. We think this is overall unavoidable, but we would personally suggest first increasing to 400 and re-evaluate”\n\nThis proposal aims to increase the active set of validators by 5 per era, for 20 eras. The call also executes a one-time increase by 3 to reach 400 validators by the end of the 20 eras. Note that this initiative is submitted on behalf of a coalition of 1kvP validators.\n\n- Preimage Hash: `0xbacad43f5467717cb1edfba6317524dc1d24fe3246afbe6a8cea7ed5fae1ba5f`\n- Call data: [HERE](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/extrinsics/decode/0x1a0408070a0c010401000000014038000014000000fe070a14)\n\nPlease note this proposal is submitted as an external motion: meaning if/after Council approves, the community will vote in referenda queue for the final decision. \n\nMake sure to review and vote!",

      "title": " Treasury Proposal by Centrifuge: Support Axelar General Message Passing in the Polkadot ecosystem (via BridgeHub)",
      "content": "**Proponent:** 12wWLUd5qMzLFGqBsMnHLVFeTuYJwuo5ygMAxuSywrBX1XSF\n\n**Date:** 2023.04.07\n\n**Requested DOT:** 43,913 DOT (277,000 USD)\n\n**Contact:**  jeroen@k-f.co & frederik@k-f.co\n\n---\n\nCurrently, the only bridges available to users of the Polkadot ecosystem have some limitations, including:\n\n1. Being EVM-specific and not Substrate native, e.g. several bridges (including Axelar) have been deployed on Moonbeam EVM. While this is great for bootstrapping liquidity in those EVM networks, it complicates integrations with other parachains through XCM and adds significant overhead.\n\n2. Centralized bridges which are reliant on multisigs, which is incompatible with the Web3 vision of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n3. Bridges that only go to Ethereum mainnet, and don’t support message passing.\n\nWe believe Axelar is an ideal option for solving those problems, as it’s a decentralized protocol based on delegated proof-of-stake, with support for general message passing across all its target domains. It’s currently connected to 32 blockchains, including Ethereum, Avalanche, Celo, Arbitrum, Cosmos, and Polygon.\n\nAxelar’s any-to-any connectivity is crucial to the success of any ecosystem. Within Cosmos, where Axelar is the most widely used interoperability platform, historically only a minority of users onboard from Ethereum mainnet, with [Polygon being the most popular option](https://axelarscan.io/transfers?sourceChain=polygon&destinationChain=osmosis). By enabling people to onboard from any ecosystem, we expand the user base of Polkadot, Centrifuge and the ecoystem. Axelar network supports General Message Passing across chains and delivers any-to-any connectivity. Most people are familiar with cross-chain activity via bridges, which can only transport wrapped representations of assets. General Message Passing goes beyond: Axelar can transport any payload. This enables more sophisticated cross-chain operations, like buying an NFT representing a RWA on Centrifuge, with an asset held on Arbitrum. [Axelar is working with Circle](https://www.circle.com/blog/composable-usdc-seamless-multichain-ux-by-axelar) to compose this functionality with CCTP, so that users can perform those operations with 0-slippage.\n\nCentrifuge and Axelar have been discussing the need for this with the ecosystem and the following parachains have also expressed an interest in using a Substrate-native Axelar integration:\n* Astar\n* Acala\n* Oak Network\n* Parallel\n* Gear\n* Manta\n* Clover\n* Composable\n* Equilibrium\n* Interlay\n* Peaq network\n* Unique\n* Watr\n* OmniBTC\n\nThe deliverable for this proposal contains an Axelar-Gateway-Pallet compatible with XCM to be integrated in the BridgeHub common good parachain, an Audit of the given pallet and all work around maintenance. The given Axelar-Gateway-Pallet will also be usable for a \"local\" deployment so that it will help all Substrate based parachains to connect to Axelar.\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ijCKnuFh4CNOLmObysNTyOa1WW10Ou0bWuf5wxMxetg/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThe discussion post can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1755)",

      "title": "RockX Public RPC Node Support Q4 2022 & New Development Q2 & Q3 2023",
      "content": "**Proponent:** RockX Official\n\n**DOT Account:** 14tm4js6PgrDGZttNzyy7CM4pnYiPu3LxxZDb1zhJWUc5Wpj\n\n**Date:** 28/04/2023\n\n**Requested allocation:** USD $93,063 (15,485 DOT)\n\n**Proposal Summary:** Provide free RPC service for the community in 2023 across multiple parachains to encourage growth and development.\n\n### **Project Summary**\n\nRockX currently provides free APIs on Polkadot and Kusama up to 100,000 requests per day. However, we would like to accelerate the ecosystem’s growth by expanding our offering to eventually include free packages for more parachains.\n\nWith the Treasury’s support, we plan to add 3 Parachains every Quarter from the start of 2023 until mid-2023 for a total of 6, where we will evaluate the current ecosystem status and adjust our processes accordingly. After the initial 6 chains have been onboarded, we aim to conduct an open call with other parachains to understand levels of interest before submitting a new proposal to add more parachains. We will also expand our Polkadot node offering to include a free archive node solution.\n\nIn addition to free API requests, RockX also provides a developer-friendly portal that allows users to set up APIs across all supported chains with just a few clicks, reducing the complexity and set-up time drastically. Last but not least, developers can also subscribe to our blockchain maintenance dashboard so that they will be able to receive the latest blockchain update information about Polkadot and its ecosystem.\n\nTo support the development of the Polkadot ecosystem, RockX will be offering free plans for developers that include 100K requests per day (or 3 million requests per month) for each blockchain supported above. This will be sufficient for most developers and users. Developers can access this free API service by creating their own API Key on the RockX portal and using the provided tools to optimize their development efforts. Up to 10 API keys can be generated for free for each blockchain. If any customization is needed, RockX can also assist with setting up custom archive nodes or full nodes. Every quarter, RockX strives to improve and enhance our product offerings and infrastructure for developers in the Polkadot ecosystem, including front-end UI, connectivity, security, and reliability. New product releases can be found on RockX’s Twitter page.\n\nIn summary, we’re here to take on all the complexities of node operations and utilize economies of scale and scope to lower the developers’ barriers (time and money) to adoption.\n\n**History & Reliability**\n\nRockX has been providing RPCs for Polkadot and Kusama since Oct 2021 and has achieved service reliability of 99.9% for Q4 2022 ([Link](https://access.rockx.com/product/polkadot-blockchain-api-for-web3-builders)).\n\nThe duplicate Polkadot nodes setup and the automatic failover system ensure the stability of the Polkadot node. In case of a node failure incident or during the Polkadot mainnet upgrade period, the automatic failover system directs users' requests to a backup node, ensuring continuous network operation.\n\n**Notable Recent Enhancements & Support:**\n\nQ3/22\n\nUpgraded analytics dashboard to provide users more visibility on API usage\nUploaded videos about \"How to build on a blockchain with Access Node\"\nLaunched IP whitelist, and origin whitelist feature to enhance user’s security when using the RPC services\n\nQ4/22\n\nWrote blog post to introduce Polkadot staking. In this post, RockX delves into the details of how staking Polkadot works, and why it's important for the success and growth of the Polkadot network. RockX will continue to -create new and educational content across the Polkadot ecosystem\nLaunched maintenance notification dashboard to keep users informed as soon as possible on any blockchain upgrades\nLaunched an incognito mode that will not store user’s IP address or browser information to further protect user's privacy\n\nOur full report including data and links can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QTP7xPki6CAar-X2Uey-yGOYprAIaru83mibcSlen5g/edit).\n\nOur previous community post with feedback on this proposal can be viewed [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1630).",

The header was overwritten via [inherent transaction](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/transaction-types/#inherent-transactions) from the collator. This transaction was supposed to be rejected. Still, it was not rejected due to a Substrate bug: [https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9210](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9210)\nThe issue now needs to be fixed by re-executing one of two extrinsics from the previously executed referendum to set the correct header of the parachain.\n###\n**Impact**\n###\nThe network runtime is in the correct state after the execution of the previous proposal to reset the parachain. Still, due to the incorrect head, the parachain cannot produce blocks.\n###\n**Remedy**\n###\nThe execution of one of the extrinsic to set the Watr’s parachain (2,058) head from the previously executed governance proposal will fix the issue.\n###\n**Proof of Authencity**\n###\n`We confirm the intention to reset the head of the Watr parachain (id: 2058) to 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a3a2baafaa9623dbeab06759b78f4bce878d0fbfeef992a546bce6670131e6103170a2e7597b7b7e3d84c05391d139a62b157e78786d8c082f29dcf4c11131400 to resolve the issue caused by a bug in the enactment of referendum 113`\n###\nSignature\n\n`0x9618272c953c90b67973d2525bead280ea74f71d0104b267767b9312f7785f28ec683f269d565d6faf4927faa4262730b4939e71fea292be50be7e5b1f9bb987`\n###\t\nBelow is the preimage:\n\n- Hash: `0xac9ff5733f194470235d78f67d56e656a0d8ee8a908dda7782d22ed2dfb9f9eb`\n\n- Extrinsic: `paras.forceSetCurrentHead`(2058, [newHead](https://github.com/Watr-Protocol/seedling/blob/main/watr-head-data))",

The device is envisioned as flat card mostly consisting of e-paper screen and few controls (and it allows keys to stay safely in depth).\n\nKampela is a hardware version of Parity Signer. It is a small card-shaped device (ideally comparable to a credit card form factor, to be carried in a wallet when needed) that accepts data through unidirectional NFC port and shows output on a monochrome electronic paper screen. It has cryptographic strongbox with elliptic curves supported by Substrate — which only stores private keys (after initial import) and performs all signing operations on-chip.\n\nKampela is designed to be a comparatively low-cost (below €100, in contrast to €500+ for a Signer-compatible smartphone) single-purpose device, which would only support a single seed phrase per unit, operated via a drastically simplified user interface. However, it would have all the security features of Parity Signer: a full-featured SURI account derivation system, transactions preview, metadata updates, logging.\n\nAs something that supports the same QR code output formats as Signer, it would be able to drop-in replace Signer when providing signatures back to a mobile/desktop wallet. The only challenge would be in transforming the current QR-driven input format of Signer into a suitable NFC payload. Alongside with native support in some apps (which would require software modification) this can also be achieved with a tiny “translator” app for a regular (online, not necessary trusted — one’s usual daily driver) mobile phone: it would snap a QR code with the transaction details and (statelessly, without any extra features or complicated UI) transform that into an NFC payload.\n\nKampela is a natural (and long-discussed) extension of Parity Signer to leverage the most out of modern hardware-based crypto chips and drastically reduce Signer’s attack surface: no mobile OS, not extra platform features, no unexpected communication methods or airplane mode to take care of.\n\nKampela is not a wallet! It is a signing tool, it is not able to track on-chain balances, validate things over chain-provided information or generate transactions on itself.\n\nThe scope of this proposal does not include actual production, but does result in all preliminary development required for production. Hopefully, many assembly shops would rush in to compete with us and each other!\n\nAs these last milestones were listed out long time ago, it makes sense to clarify them now with more details on planned work and deliverables:\n\n# Milestone 5\n\n- Fabricate another iteration of the casing (test mechanical integrity of device, usability, etc)\n- Test end-of-life secure self-destruct feature: it's trigger circuit (can we rely on broken screen as self-destruct indicator? Is trigger easy to activate? Is indication clear?) and success (does the chip indeed understand wipe command and use small enough power to perform it?)\n- Power circuit (test whether it supports various phones budgets and withstands some instability; make sure device can safely burn off residual power and reboot on power loss)\n- User input (make sure touch pad input on E-Ink is not too frustrating)\n- Test secure element powered key management (encrypt key, decrypt, check attempt counter and self-destruct features)\n- NFC reception of large signed payloads\n\nWe have decided to leave RNG analysis out of scope, as that component of chip is indeed certified and tested upstream; implementing extra hashing over existing certified secure RNG device in an airgapped cold device with single baremetal app running does not seem feasible, as implementation error risks greatly outweigh probability of hardware attacks, as there is no path to pass exploit trigger event for an attacker; deploying simpler exploits that would make SE accessible to an attacker or make snapshots of onboard RAM, would be simpler for manufacturer to embed into hardware.\n\n# Milestone 6\n\n- Final specifications for NFC communication protocol\n- Full manufacturing schematics for the device, including \"hacker\" edition with programming interface exposed for enthusiasts and hackers to play with, that we intend to manufacture and distribute to order right after completion of the project, as it obviously does not require any audit\n- Prepare documentation on analysis of device, for community to study and for auditors to facilitate manufacturing security audit procedure\n- Demonstration of fully assembled and operational device with basic functionality and interface\n- Decision on whether active NFC tag dummy could be used as second factor with sufficiently secure signing of NFC responses at current level of technology without too high impact on power system of the Kampela device",

      "title": "Motif: Web3 user research platform",
      "content": "Hello DOT builders, developers, independent researchers, and community!\nWe would like to present to you a user behavior research product that will help improve the effectiveness of application development in the ecosystem and identify possible synergistic partnerships. Our goal is to study user behavior based on the ALREADY existing onchain information on the blockchain. \n\n[Original discussion post >>](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1679)\n\n### Context of the proposal\nWe propose web3 user-research tool for the Polkadot ecosystem that enables developers to analyze and score user behavior on-chain, providing a deeper understanding of the current state of the ecosystem at the user, dApp, and parachain level.\n\nWith real-time detailed snapshots of the existing Polkadot community, developers can improve their products, create stronger communities, and effectively incentivize newcomers using Motif's insights. \n\n### Reference/experience\nOur team has conducted and is actively engaged in multiple research projects to battle-test our event-based extraction method. Examples of completed and ongoing studies include:\n- dYdX (complete)\n- Astar (complete)\n- Lido (in progress)\n\nWe have made an effort to provide a comprehensive explanation in a [full proposal >>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEhn-kQQjYxpWD8hC05Nc4VK9oPYROFl/edit)\n\nIn the following sections, we will present the results of these studies and demonstrate that the event-based method is sufficient for the purposes of research within the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\n### Problem statement\nThe operation of P2P systems is based on the P - peers (or people)  themselves. Due to the nature of independent economic systems with internal accounting units, users not only generate revenue but also directly influence the economic parameters of the system. It is the behavior of users that is the main lifeblood and success factor of that kind of economic systems. To operate successfully within such ecosystems, the creators of both the ecosystems themselves and the services and applications within the ecosystem must have a good understanding of user behavior, tools to influence it, and effectively track results.\n- How can we identify the users who effectively and consistently use the dApps?\n- How can we identify the users who fraud actions and try to deceive the system to obtain a reward?\n- What motivates users to provide liquidity and how does the ecosystem incentivize them to continue doing so?\n- How can we track the last actions of users who have transitioned from one ecosystem to another?\n- How can we motivate average users to engage more actively with the system?\n- How can we retain existing profitable users?\n\nAnswering these simple questions or finding relevant information within Polkadot is practically impossible. The main reasons for this are:\n- Blockchain user data reality itself: a huge, interconnected and decentralized mess which is difficult to explore. \n- The modular multilevel structure of Polkadot is hard to overview.\n- The limited number of functioning dApps and zero-to-none smart-contracts as a source of customer behavior leads to a lack of information.\n\n### How is this problem being solved today?\n\nOne of the current solutions is one-by-one research. However, \"wallet-by-wallet\" research is extremely difficult. Researchers have to go to different wallets, look at the experience of interactions, compare similar wrapped/transferred tokens/coins/portfolios, actions, etc. Comparing users, let alone profiling them is almost impossible. It leaves no chance for factually understanding users' behavior and providing targeted incentivization to wallets with relevant experience. \n\nDue to this complexity, analysis often boils down to two simple metrics: the number of tokens on the relay chain or the number of wallets (for example, how many came and performed some action). This leads to a distortion of reality and inefficiency in analysis and results: prioritizing “big balance” leads to the dominance of \"whales\" behavior, while “big numbers” lead to the domination of \"bot farms.\" However, these cases do not lead to growing the numbers of the active users, and such metrics do not allow the application to improve its efficiency. On the contrary, they provide an opportunity for potential fraud from such participants.\nEven for the whole ecosystem itself these \"bot farms\" and \"whales\" can create a centralization effect, exposing the ecosystem to potential manipulation by centralized third parties. \nTherefore, a significant portion of tools based on user behavior aimed at incentivizing them, such as airdrops, retrodrops, quests, whitelists, and others, do not produce the desired results.\n\n\n### Motif’s solution\n\nMotif provides 3 main tools: \n\n**1. Parachain and Relay Chain Overview User State (B2B)**\nThis tool provides an overview of the current holders, including their profiles, assets, and level of activity. It can help identify the most active and engaged users in the ecosystem and their holding patterns. \n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVyzQMfwgt2veQQuS7GmstE7XSHwyhTrBPqS6p23oGwXM?_gl=1*5q5xpv*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\n**2. Individual Wallet Cross-Parachain Traction Analytics for Personal Use (B2C)**\nAny user can input an existing native wallet address and receive comprehensive information about the user's activity, presented in an easy-to-use format. This includes details on the assets the user currently holds or has held in the past, the specific assets they have traded, and the most active protocols or parachains the user has interacted with.\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPNUF5NUWu3GvCuJtdRiCCJzCcYXSNt8bUjYRtxi3PPLk?_gl=1*1s9z1iz*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\n**3. Batch Scoring of User Sets (B2B)**\nMotif provides the opportunity to score a set of users in a batch, allowing for research and analysis of user sets. This helps to identify the best users for DeFi, which users will hold long-term, and which users are most active members of the Polkadot community.\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVMTw3JordrdZjrcjYXhpC9hxN3TzKbrkRvQmsuexU3Ps?_gl=1*1s9z1iz*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\nThe goal of Motif is to help developers improve the user experience of their dApps and incentivize the most active and engaged users. Our core concept is to research and connect the most valuable users with the most suitable dApps to accelerate the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n\n### Research method \n\nOur research method at Motif is event-based, focusing on events within transactions and associated data.\nWe generally work in two major steps: Extraction and Calculation (or orchestration). The extraction step involves collecting and organizing data from various sources, while the calculation step involves analyzing and interpreting the data to gain insights and produce results.\n\nYou can learn more about our methodology in the [full proposal >>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEhn-kQQjYxpWD8hC05Nc4VK9oPYROFl/edit#heading=h.3dy6vkm)\n\nHere we will provide an overview of the main capabilities of our proven methodologies.\n\n**Event-based extraction method can produce enough data for the web3 research**\n\nFurthermore, the discovered clusters can be statistically described, which can aid in making predictions about the performance of future users and their actions \n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmdF7CKBzpjgCbmwjih38oQvhY4tcmXCG1V4JWdjbdBUMa?_gl=1*7jddbl*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmPNxxdmdPfPJZhUFzxE7BojRNM8xbJrqpSA9W9KdohbSr?_gl=1*twtwv8*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\n\n**Users can be profiled by their activity or assets**\n\nUsers can be profiled based on their activity or assets. This is known as user profiling, which involves dividing users into groups based on their interests.\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmVmCqXYve9QypMMPKiXw542L8jSusC4sjzPcBtvEra2ZC?_gl=1*4fhpby*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\n\n**Motif can be used for dynamic research too.**\n\nThis is how the clusterization looks after event-based extraction and aggregate recombination \n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmT1Cx4RGnfUa53a7ASc7N7EnqFkgzCbnbqMCVty1faTj1?_gl=1*dz7fmg*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\nAdditionally, we can use other hypotheses to define clusters, such as the economic value of the user being proportional to the amount of gas spent. The more gas a user spends, the more money they spend. This can be used to further define and analyze the clusters.\n\n![](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmWH7ggYDw4i6hRXW5y84hyMbeFyjo3rzfEchCZaSoLyHX?_gl=1*17w0ipi*_ga*MTc4ODEzODIxNy4xNjc4MTIzMTc1*_ga_5RMPXG14TE*MTY3ODEyMzE3NC4xLjEuMTY3ODEyMzI0MC41Ny4wLjA.)\n\n**Event-based Method battle-test results**\n\n- Wallets with at least 10 transactions can be studied using transaction data, which provides a variety of features (such as type, timestamp, gas spent, and method) that are suitable for statistical and machine learning analysis.\n- A daily average of 80 unique active wallets (UAW) is sufficient to uncover correlations and create user profiles.\n- Wallet profiles can be predicted using research data and on-chain metrics such as minimum token levels, chains, or key actions.\n\nYou can learn more about our methodology in the [full proposal >>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEhn-kQQjYxpWD8hC05Nc4VK9oPYROFl/edit#heading=h.3dy6vkm)\n\n\n### Stakeholders benefits\n**DApps**\nOur goal is to improve the efficiency of dApp onboarding and operation by providing opportunities for researching users, rival dApps, and the parachain itself. This allows dApps to easily navigate different ecosystems and onboard the most relevant communities. Additionally, dApps can better understand user needs and experiences, and reward the best users for their on-chain activity and holding without fear of flipping. This can streamline dApp development and operations and save on marketing and liquidity costs.\nFor example, dApps can incentivize users with different profiles (Top degens, Strong Holders, Early Adopters, etc.) using modern mechanics such as retrodrops, airdrops, and claims.\n\n**Ecosystems (parachains)**\nEcosystems will have the opportunity to onboard relevant dApps (if they want to work on top of parachains), which can increase the use of native coins and grow the user base organically. This will lead to rewards for user loyalty and experience. Additionally, ecosystems can incentivize users to explore new experiences without the risk of losing funds to bot farms or flippers.\n\n**Polkadot community**\nPolkadot community members, whether experienced or new, will have the ability to be recognized for their loyalty and experience, and will be able to receive benefits for their engagement with the ecosystem. This can include rewards for on-chain activity, holding native tokens, or participating in research and development of the ecosystem.\n\n### New use cases for the Polkadot\n\n**Updatable/dynamic Web3 id.** Motif offers an updatable and dynamic Web3 ID that can meet the demands of on-chain user recognition, scoring, and profiling systems. This ID can be integrated into smart-contracts or routing systems, providing enhanced security for users and customization options for dApp developers.\nThe general idea is to enable blockchain applications to provide personalized conditions based on a user's real on-chain experience, without using any information from outside the blockchain (off-chain can be easily manipulated). The existing \"HYPE concept\" of soulbound tokens does not seem suitable, as the verification should occur at the moment of interaction (there can be a gap between the emission of the SBT token and the interaction).This case can be solved by implementing a scoring smart contract standalone or within the routing circuit (as part of it or as part of the route when conditions occur). Such a \"smart contract factory\" can work based on the solution we propose.\n\n**DID.** Motif can also provide a decentralized digital ID based on the user's fingerprint (user trace in one wallet types) and predicted level of on-chain activity.. \nCurrent solutions for user address unification based solely on public addresses are not viable as they can be easily falsified. In our view, a usable digital fingerprint is only possible with transactions that have internal economic value. This combination of transaction patterns with economic significance and related information increases the chances of a real human subject managing the given address. Again, thresholds and identification of such transactions are possible on the proposed platform.\n\n**Web2 scoring** where Web3 data can be used by Web2 apps for various purposes.\n\n**Web3 scoring interfaces** for the Polkadot. \n\n**Web3 scoring backend** for Polkadot, such as Nansen/debank look-alike dApps that currently do not exist in the ecosystem.\n\nThese use-cases can provide opportunities to onboard new dApps to the Polkadot ecosystem, increasing its potential for growth and usage.\n\n\nYou can learn more about our Motif in the [full proposal >>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WEhn-kQQjYxpWD8hC05Nc4VK9oPYROFl/edit#heading=h.3dy6vkm)\n\n\nWe would greatly appreciate your feedback and ideas for improvement. We thank the participants of the Polkadot ecosystem and colleagues from Parity for their intensive work on this proposal.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy name is Chris Veselinov, CTO of LimeChain, and I’m writing this thread to propose the development (and funding) of a Parachain Validation Conformance Testing.\n\nWith this proposal, we’re looking to identify test cases and implement conformance tests for the execution of the parachain verification function across different node implementations and wasm engines. \n\nThis project is inspired by the currently open RFP for **[Parachain Validation Conformance Testing](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Open/parachain_validation_conformance_testing.md)**\n\nThe ultimate/end goal is to define the baseline for the execution of parachain validation functions within a reasonable limits across different implementations. This will ensure that updating wasm engines, introducing new node implementations etc. can be done in a sane way without hoping for the best.\n\n**Please see the official proposal document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C44lIlpoQMDaGlni9XT-SXJUtT-Ei3Et1osFoa-1W-g). Any feedback or comments are highly appreciated.**\n\nAbout us: LimeChain is a blockchain development company founded in 2017 with a focus on building core blockchain infrastructure, developer tooling and dapps. We dove into the Polkadot ecosystem about 2 years ago with [Subsembly](https://github.com/LimeChain/subsembly) - a framework used to design and implement Substrate runtimes in AssemblyScript, again funded by the W3F. \nSome of the ecosystem work we’ve done involves the creation of Runtime from scratch and evolving it into fully capable frameworks for building Substrate Runtimes. Since the end of 2022, we are also actively working on [gosemble](https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble) which is a framework for developing Substrate compatible Runtimes.\n\nLimeChain is also leading the initiative for Polkadot Java host implementation and [research](https://github.com/LimeChain/java-host-research). This will further extend our knowledge of the PVFs and the specifics of their execution.\n\n[Link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1683) to the discussion.\n\nThanks on behalf of the whole LimeChain team!",

      "title": "Talisman Proposal: Portal Web Application supporting Nomination Pools and more - Milestone 1",
      "content": "Talisman (talisman.xyz) is a community-owned wallet and web application that enables users to “traverse the Paraverse” with ease. We believe in a future where everyone has freedom via true agency over their intentions and finances, and we believe that DotSama will bring this to fruition. \n\nFor more on Talisman’s mission and approach, please see Agyle’s talk at Polkadot Decoded: [Polkadot Decoded 2022: Traverse the Paraverse: How Talisman is bringing multi-chain to the masses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tZjVv70Jk)\n\nAnd Jonathan’s talk about wallet UX at the Sub0 developer conference:\n[Talisman: The UX Chronicles: How To Deliver A Substrate Experience To The Masses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_xiMaDAEiQ)\n\nToday, because of its early stage of development and complex multi-chain architecture, both Polkadot and Kusama are changing rapidly and the user experience (UX) can be confusing for end users. It’s our goal to solve that using design, storytelling, and engineering. We abstract away the complexity of underlying implementation and provide a friendly user experience when using DotSama and a way to discover new applications and services available to end users, while keeping them safe and educated about the actions they are taking.\n\nIn this proposal, we are seeking to fund improvements to Talisman Portal, Talisman’s “one stop shop” web application that enables users to discover and access Polkadot ecosystem activities with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. This is an open source dapp that supports multiple Polkadot Ecosystem wallets, including: Polkadot.js (500,000+ users), Talisman (20,000+ users), SubWallet (20,000+ users), and Enkrypt (20,000+ users).\n\nThe Talisman Portal is an open source dapp hosted at [https://app.talisman.xyz](https://app.talisman.xyz). It targets the Polkadot Adventurer, a crypto user who believes in the Polkadot vision and spends a large chunk of time exploring and participating in ecosystem activities, including:\n\n- Viewing, managing and organizing multi-chain assets (tokens, NFTs) and accounts\n- Generating a return on investment for their portfolio (we do not provide financial advice, but rather allow users to better understand their positions and opportunities)\n- Discovering and participating new dapps and services available in the ecosystem, such as crowdloans (live) and governance (targeted for later in 2023)\n- Education and learning about Polkadot, the ecosystem and dapps and services that are available\n\nDirectly enabled by the work in this proposal, includes the UX work around Talisman’s nomination pools, which has led to Talisman's nomination pool garnering the largest amount of DOT since launch (>1 million DOT). This is a testament to the simplicity of the staking experience provided by Portal, combined with our trusted brand for new and experienced users. We hope to continue to enable users to stake easily no matter how much or little DOT they have in their accounts.\n\nMore than just providing a feature set, Portal is designed with the user first, because UX and design are incredibly hard problems in a multi-chain and quickly-evolving environment. Polkadot Adventurers are committed to being in Polkadot, but they need trusted tools that simplify the experience and enable them to become evangelists that ultimately bring new users into the ecosystem.\n\nThe following feedback is from a recent user survey in Feb 2023 about Talisman Portal:\n\n- “Being easy to use is why I recommend it to my normie frens”\n- “I consider the strength to be viewing cross-chain assets all in one place”\n- “Definitely better UI/UX and easier to use than Polkadot.js”\n- “Awesome design and an essential tool for day to day use of Polkadot”\n- “The super simple interface gives me peace of mind when dealing with my money”\n- 90% consider staking easier to use than Polkadot.js or the most convenient way to stake DOT\n\n\n\n\nThe full proposal is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OlJB4a2kcgWe-TZTC4ZR5cU9ZEIk8IoC85IJv2_2rdc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis submission follows from the following forum discussion: [link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1699)\n",

We will re-submit this Proposal later.\n\nHey Polkadot Community!\n\nMy name is Alex, and I am super excited to have the opportunity to finally put a lot of thought, planning and strategy into motion and execute a set of development initiatives in order to help build Polkadot ecosystem with MVP Workshop, one of the Europe's pioneers in Web3 & Blockchain, and with my responsibility as a Web3 Founder & Business Developer.\n\nThe first step is for our team at MVP Workshop to build a UI & Front-End for DotSwap, a UniSwap V1-based DEX on Statemint.\n\nA bit more information about MVPW:\n\n[MVP Workshop](https://mvpworkshop.co) is a Blockchain Product Research & Development Studio, and one of the pioneers of Web3 in Europe.\n\nWe are an innovative team of 50+ engineers, developers, designers, consultants and marketers who are head-over-heels in love with the wide range of possible applications of blockchain technology. Our experience counts 70+ developed Blockchain products, and we are proud to say that our biggest accomplishments are:\n\n- Polygon’s official implementation partner (built Polygon Edge, Nightfall Block Explorer and 5+ more products during a 3-year partnership). We are also very proud to say that Mihailo Bijelic, Co-Founder of Polygon, came from our research facility named 3327 and that we proposed the name ‘Polygon’ when it was still MATIC Network. 🙂\n\n- Parity’s Substrate Delivery partners: 2 years ago we got in touch with Parity to build a variety of products for the Polkadot ecosystem, including Substrate Starter Kit. Although we’ve hold off scaling the Rust team, we’re now dedicated towards creating a dedicated department (and maybe even a venture) that would focus on new projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, as we’ve been in touch with Parity regarding building Parachain SDK, as well as the UI for DEX on Statemint, that we’re currently writing a Proposal for.\n\n- Complete technology solution for Celsius Network: Although we all know what happened with Celsius, we are still proud with what we’ve accomplished, as we didn’t have anything to do with the Business or Management side, and even our company funds and my personal funds are still stuck.\n\nAlso, we’re proud to say that 3 weeks ago, we’ve managed to get into top 12 finalists out of 250+ companies on ETHGlobal’s Hackathon on building dApps on top of FVM (Filecoin Virtual Machine).\n\nThe list goes on and on, as we’ve been working closely with more recognizable industry names such as Moonbeam, Bitcoin.com, yearn.finance, created different products on Cardano, and many more.\n\nOur DEX experience: \n\nAlready mentioned, we have a significant experience developing Celsius, a UniSwap fork for a big CeFi product, a DEX for Bitcoin.com built on Moonbeam, Tesseract finance (supported by yearn.finance), Revuto (a DEX on Cardano) and more.\n\nYou'll find UI samples in [the full Proposal found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xPFwfqGrbU2B_9h_RB8SfU6ya7gDRvGKGLUrO_NMjMg/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nSo far, MVPW Studio has been engaged in Polkadot ecosystem by:\n\n- Creating a [Substrate-Starter-Kit](https://mvpworkshop.co/blog/proudly-presenting-substrate-blockchain-starter-kit/) (which is a tool that brings the simplicity of creating a substrate-based blockchain by simple drag and drop pallets to a codebase.\n\n- Developed a DEX on Moonbeam as a part of cooperation with Bitcoin.com (was never launched).\n\nToday, we’re in close contact with Parity representatives in two big initiatives:\n\n- Parachain SDK (a tool that will offer a set of shortcuts to easily deploy Parachains in a more affordable and quick way)\n\n- UI & Front-end for a DEX on Statemint (a project we’re writing this proposal for)\n\nWith our serious plans to dive in the Polkadot ecosystem and give our full experience and expertise into empowering it, we are planning to submit a proposal for the UI & Front-End development of DotSwap, a DEX built on top of Statemint, a generic assets parachain and the first common good project, which provides functionality for deploying and transferring assets.\n\nIn the full Proposal document, you'll find a following structure/outline of topics:\n\n1. Requirements & Funding\n2. Introduction\n3. About us (Company background)\n4. Context of the proposal (Our principles on building on Polkadot, Statemint challenge, MVP Workshop's solution by contributing to build a UI & Front-End for the DEX 'DotSwap', etc.)\n5. Scope of Work + Project Estimates\n\nHaving lots of experience in infrastructure and enterprise business solutions, we wanted to share our input on Polkadot, in terms of what we will focus on in order to contribute to the massive adoption of the technology amongst the industry.\n\nWe've found out about this initiative from talking internally with Parity team who onboarded us fully with the project requirements and description, which only made us thrilled to scope and estimate the UI & FE development and start with MVPW's contribution to the ecosystem.\n\nFor this development initiative, we’re asking for $80,960 or 13,500 DOT on the date and time (6-March) that 1 DOT = $5,97\n\nThank you Stefan, Rich, Vi, Alex, Gilles and many more who contributed in the continuous support on this initiative. 🙏🏼",

      "content": "**EXTRA NOTE ON THE REJECTION SUGGESTION:**\n###\nWhile the proposal moved to external queue to be voted by the community after Council approval, the Acala team noticed an issue with the runtime release: The XCM weight isn't benchmarked for Polkadot and the base weight is used, which assumes each XCM instruction takes 64k proof size. For XCM message with 1D weight, a default proof size of 64k is used. This means xcm buy weight with limited 1D weight will fail on [this line](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/f1a45b39db6dbb7610c80b82d7cfca45a807619d/xcm/xcm-builder/src/barriers.rs#L96): this only impacts XCM V2 instructions using limited weight. Unlimited weight is fine.\n\nThe teams are now studying on what appropriate value should be put into the proof size weight component for BaseXcmWeight: once this is decided, a new release will be cut and the proposal will be submitted for vote again. \n\nFor now, this proposal can be cancelled/rejected.\n###\n__________________________________________________________\n###\nThis proposal aims upgrade Polkadot relay chain to runtime [v9381](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.38-rc12) and Polkadot System Parachains (Statemint/Collectives) to runtime [v9382](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v9382): the specific details on this upgrade please check the release notes. This release contains the changes from v0.9.39-1 to v0.9.38-rc12. **Among other things, this upgrade includes XCMv3 on Polkadot**. Please note that two calls for the System parachains upgrade are `xcm.send` extrinsics that send `authorize_upgrade` messages to Statemint and the Collectives, while for the relay chain upgrade is `setCode`\n###\n- Call Hash: `0x1f099c751e66ce10f619564a25f2c6d7b6cbc4fdc29baa2ea991762f1a782bcf`\n\n- Preimage is submitted and can be reviewed [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/preimages).\n\n\n**Relay chain Runtime**\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#13065](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13065) Low - Allow duplicate topics in smart contract events\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#13105](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13105) Low - Scheduler is already at v4\n\n- [P] [#4097](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/4097) Low - Xcm v3\n\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6490](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6490) Low - Enable treasury.spend by root origin for polkadot network before gov2\n\n- [P] ⏳ pending non-critical audit [#6573](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6573) Low - Allow auctionadmin to use scheduler\n\n- [S] ✅ audited [#13214](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13214) ❗️ Medium - [fix] countedmap::set now takes counter into account\n\n- [S] ✅ audited [#13204](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13204) Low - Contracts: deprecate random interface\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#13194](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13194) Low - Correct arithmetical semantic of perdispatchclass\n\n- [S] ⏳ pending non-critical audit [#11637](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11637) Low - Add proof size to weight output\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#13235](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13235) Low - Migrate new benchmarking syntax from frame_support::benchmarking to frame_benchmarking::v2\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#13216](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/13216) Low - Remove uncles related code\n###\nThis proposal is submitted as an external motion: meaning if/after Council approves the motion, the community will have the final say in referenda queue.  \n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "**Proponent:** 5D5TJ7cNZWuRgXYe4oxizBqWG31eJ1iFpY24JU2jzDccEiwY\n\n**Date:** 10 April 2023\n\n**Requested DOT:** 4201.0828\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for 2022, for the running of public-good SubQuery Dictionary Projects which serve pre-computed indexes of each block for most Polkadot and Kusama parachains. These public projects enable the parachain teams and teams within their ecosystem to increase the data indexing speed of their SubQuery projects by up to 10 times.\n\n**Full Proposa:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SjoBgDzX-fJmVWLXQPhQlpy29oimRbHD42tQjGdqgdY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SjoBgDzX-fJmVWLXQPhQlpy29oimRbHD42tQjGdqgdY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Raw Data:** <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17829KgXp5aXKXkaPw7A7oCgjMBB8vEuCg2Pyk1MGQnY/edit#gid=0>\n\nOriginal Motivation\n===================================\n\nSubQuery is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Kusama, and other layer-1 chains in Substrate, Avalanche, Algorand, Terra, NEAR, and Cosmos projects, we provide data for developers to use for a wide array of projects (wallets, explorers, custom chains, or any other decentralised app). In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.\n\nThroughout the whole of 2022 (01/01/2022 - 31/12/2022) we've provided public SubQuery Projects, termed Dictionaries, for most parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem to dramatically increase indexing performance (up to 10x faster) and so far these dictionaries have served over 1 billion requests.\n\nA SubQuery dictionary is a special SubQuery Project which scans over the network, and records metadata of every event and extrinsic on each block. When other SubQuery projects index data on any of these chains, they can ask the dictionary what blocks a filtered list of events/intrinsics appear on. Rather than having to search through each block, dictionaries reduce the amount of data that the indexer obtains from the chain, reduces load on free RPC endpoints across the ecosystem, and reduces the number of \"unwanted\" blocks stored in the local buffer. For example, instead of SubQuery inspecting each block of Polkadot's massive chain (600GB of unstructured data on over 12 million blocks) which can take many hours, dictionaries skip through to the exact right blocks.\n\nAdding the dictionary  to optimise indexing performance is as easy as adding the relevant network dictionary endpoint to your SubQuery Project. This has been added by default to all of our starter projects to make it default to use.\n\nHere you can find detailed documentation on how dictionaries work: <https://academy.subquery.network/academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.html#>\n\nSubQuery Dictionaries have been created for most parachains to the public here <https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary> and have been deployed to our Managed Service. If any other team would like a dictionary created - we are more than happy to help out.\n\nFuture Targets for Our Dictionaries\n===================================\n\n-   We're proud of our record on stability and reliability. One of our core values is to be blockchain's most reliable indexer, and we don't intend to lose sight of this as we onboard more chains and expand the number of customers relying on our hosted service for their production applications. Our goal for 2023 is 99.99% uptime, we're starting off strong with 100% so far as seen [here](https://status.subquery.network/uptime/f3j5qtmn4rhd).\n\n-   Through 2022 we ran 24 dictionaries for the in-demand parachains that we believed would add most value to the dApp developers in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Moving forward we want to be able to offer the increased indexing performance to all active block-producing parachains, our goal will be to add 20 more dictionaries to our suite of tools in 2023.\n\n-   Being on the cusp of 1 billion requests to our dictionaries in 2022 has left us hungry to smash records in 2023. This year, with the launch of our decentralised SubQuery Network and ongoing Business Development efforts, we are looking to hit (and surpass) a target of 10 billion requests to our dictionaries.\n\n-   Github Contributors. Our [dictionaries are completely open source](https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary), and SubQuery is a community project with a goal of complete decentralisation. Already last year, we welcomed contributions to our dictionaries from developers at Nodle and Subscan. We are working on making it easier for new parachains to assist us with creating dictionaries.\n\nService Details (Polkadot)\n==========================\n\nBetween 2022-01-01 and 2022-12-31 our Polkadot Dictionaries have:\n\n-   Served an extraordinary total of 733,069,683 (over 700 million) requests\n\n-   The Polkadot Dictionary alone served 630,818,299 (over 630 million) requests\n\n-   The highest daily total of the Polkadot Dictionary was 19,219,650 requests in a single 24 hour period occurring on 22nd July 2022\n\nMaintained availability at >99% uptime via our SubQuery Managed Service ([see uptime monitoring here](https://status.subquery.network/))\n\n\n**Full proposal found here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SjoBgDzX-fJmVWLXQPhQlpy29oimRbHD42tQjGdqgdY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SjoBgDzX-fJmVWLXQPhQlpy29oimRbHD42tQjGdqgdY/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "The proposal aims to seek support from the Polkadot Treasury for the 2023/3-2023/8 operating cost for the Chinese non-profit organization Polkadot Ecology Research Institute, in order to create more original and quality Chinese content, and to relay the otherwise boring technical language to Chinese users in a colloquial way, so that Chinese users can have a real knowledge of Polkadot and increase the breadth of Polkadot in the Chinese market. On the other hand, we will also follow up on the outstanding projects of the Polkadot ecology to keep everyone informed of the latest developments of the Polkadot ecology.\n\nPolkadot's success cannot be separated from the prosperity of the Polkadot Ecological Projects. Our goal is to make more people aware of Polkadot and also to make more people aware of the development of Polkadot ecology, which in turn will lead them to join in the participation and construction of Polkadot ecology, so that Polkadot and Polkadot ecology can flourish.\n\nSince September 2022, [we have established a Polkadot Treasury proposal for our 2022/9-2023/2 operation cost, and get funding from the Polkadot Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-b_DQXHVyRuAoYubCtL9dk0R6a_ev7xbwYMV518ONpo/edit?usp=sharing). Here is our [report for the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTIn83LJ9qcq4jPfZDHM-6-xA9Me1JyQ_pCxgPFXYO0/edit). Please check our report to learn more.\n\nSo this is a proposal for our six months operation cost. We apply approx 104,760.00 USD total allocation for 2023/3-2023/8 and [you can get all details here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJjtkZD8mgv5vRpBh_aoGmWqWlLK9tomGhP8M9esMng/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "content": "Polkadot Decoded is the Flagship conference and the the biggest yearly event focused on all things Polkadot. And it's back for its fourth edition on June 28th and 29th, 2023, with a fully hybrid experience of online and in-person events. Decoded aims to evolve into a general assembly for all things Polkadot/Kusama.\n\nIn 2023 we will come to Copenhagen, Denmark with an increased capacity  and there will be simultaneous satellite events hosted regionally in the USA, Europe, LatAm and China in July. These satellite events are aimed to be regionally focused. Whereas the Flagship event will be globally focused. \n\nThe program line up will be featuring presentations, panels, workshops, demos, fireside and barcamp chats. We are focusing on curating content that is more high-level for a broader audience as well as attracting decision makers and enterprises into the room. The target audience will be crossing over all six of our target personas: Business Decision Maker, Technical Decision Maker, both from startups and Enterprises interested in Polkadot, Builders from teams in the Polkadot ecosystem, DOT Holders,  Developer, Polkadot enthusiasts and supporters. Polkadot Decoded aims to be a general assembly for all things Polkadot/Kusama. However, we are mainly focusing on decision makers and enterprises. \n\nFurther information on the proposal, including milestones, budget, agenda, participants and more can be found under this [LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15OgE-hsNGepFpN-xgLDG1x5cHWJ55ltYroMGHaQnYQM/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Polkadot Bridge Hub Genesis",
      "content": "This is a proposal to add a Bridge Hub (BH) parachain to Polkadot. All technical details can be found in the [Bridge Hub Genesis release](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-bridge-hub-polkadot-v9382). The runtime is taken from the v9382 parachains release.\n\nThe BH will be the gateway between Polkadot and other networks, like Kusama and Ethereum. For now, the BH only contains some basic logic, and none of the bridge-specific pallets. Those will get added in future runtime upgrades; the goal of this proposal is to get approval from Polkadot stakeholders and launch a \"shell\" such that bridge teams can focus on releasing their bridge logic, not launching a parachain.\n\nThe BH will primarily act as a message routing system within the network and between others. For example, parachains can configure their XCMP routing to interpret `parents: 2` (indicating, \"go to another consensus system\") as something to send to the BH to handle. Likewise, the BH can handle incoming messages and route them to the correct parachain within Polkadot.\n\nOnce operational, a Polkadot<>Kusama bridge will allow more interaction between the networks. For example, from the Polkadot Collectives parachains, the Technical Fellowship can serve both Polkadot and Kusama; or the Kusama network (as a unit body) could join the Polkadot Alliance.",

Information remains siloed and difficult to access for users depending on their purpose. The “hub” sites that do exist fall victim to Polkadot’s achilles heel: technical heavy, data repository interfaces that don't focus on the user experience. Polkadot has some of the best tech in the world and we want to help make this beautiful technology accessible to masses. \n\nThe end result of this: Polkadot is being held back from its full potential. The average new user does not know where to begin or gets scared off when they’re asked to interact with developer style interfaces. We can see this across a broad depth of market data. Polkadot always leads in developer activity, and yet gets nowhere near the activity and traction as many ecosystems that are less developed and less impressive technically. \n\n**The Solution** \n\nOur overarching objective is to help participants better navigate the Polkadot ecosystem: increasing exposure and understanding by aggregating “everything Polkadot” and presenting digestible, key information in a simple user interface (“UI”). We will accomplish this by collecting and gathering information via a variety of sources, maintaining a community database, and building a user-friendly front end website. \n\nOur project will always focus on the end user. Whether the user is new to crypto or a seasoned veteran of the industry. Being a one-stop-shop can be daunting, so we will start with two smaller goals:\n\n1. Be the best, intuitive onboarding tool for new users\n\n2. Connect with teams, collaborators, investment teams, foundations, etc to define and curate the proper direction on where the ecosystem is headed\n\nWe do not want to present data merely because we collected it. Rather, we want to synthesize the disparate data and present it in a way that users can easily interact with in a simple manner. \n\nCollectively, this encompasses our main objective: making the Polkadot ecosystem easy to understand and navigate regardless of who you are.\n\n**The Results**\n\nAs part of our process, we will be focusing on specific results in order to determine if our efforts are paying off. The first result will be general traffic to our website. Every visit that goes to a website that focuses on Polkadot and the surrounding ecosystem will help drive awareness and adoption. The more eyeballs and clicks we can get, the broader the reach becomes.\n\nThe second result will be to drive traffic to DApps of teams. Onboarding users is where everyone must start, but from there we want to help users take full advantage of the ecosystem. By helping explain what DApps can accomplish, curating different ways in which they can be used, and providing links to DApps themselves as well as helpful content from around the internet, we will be able to leverage our user reach to help benefit all DApps across the ecosystem.

      "content": "Contextual Information from the team, below:\n\n**Proposal**\n\nA proposal requested by the Watr team to reset the blockchain back to seedling. Contextual information can be found below.\n\n**Context**\n\nWe tried to reset a technical genesis (pre-commercial deployment of runtime) of Watr. The current parachain model doesn't allow privileged operations such as a reset without either tokens in the sudo account, on-chain governance accounts or relay chain governance. However the tokens generated in this genesis block are locked and unusable. So we are unable to perform the reset and progress to commercial deployment. As such the network is locked and unusable without intervention from relay chain governance.\n\n**Impact**\n\nThe network is locked and cannot be used or reset without intervention from relay chain governance. Whilst Devnet is active, the reset will be purely a technical rollback since our Parachain has not gone live to user transactions or funds yet. There is no risk to other applications, other Parachains or the relay chain.\n\n**Remedy**\n\nWe have explored all other solutions and after discussion and advice from Parity experts, have created this proposal to reset the Parachain to seedling state so we can progress to commercial deployment of the Watr Parachain.\n\n**Proof of Authenticity**\n\nWe submit the following proof of authenticity, signed by the registrar of the Watr Parachain (id: 2058) `13DgtSygjb8UeF41B5H25khiczEw2sHXeuWUgzVWrFjfwcUH`,\n\n- Text: This proposal has been submitted to Polkadot governance by the Watr Team with pre-image hash `0x2929e149de9d487466fed4093f721f68cfcdce1600e8d44e4b5b5c725efebcc3`.

      "title": "Anagolay proposal: enabling community contributions for verified creators",
      "content": "UPDATE: please reject.\nThe deposit was returned to the team via a Tip approved with OpenGov Referenda #28\nMotion 377 was a proposal submitted with the goal of funding the development of cross-platform tip-as-you-go functionality by Anagolay to streamline community support for verified creators and builders. The motion didn't reach majority vote, with little feedback provided by the Council. After careful consideration, the team has decided to not pursue Treasury funding at this time and concentrate our time and efforts on a different route.\n\nUPDATE: We ask the Council to reject this proposal, and endorse the tip for the reimbursement of the deposit: [500 DOT](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/tip/0x8fb68b374450ee4780db4770a44194d1fc0cc0ad6402c36d18d89ec5987e7783)\n\nHi everyone, Daniel of Anagolay is here. \n\nWe believe monetizing and supporting creative work should be simpler, work across platforms, and be equally accessible to everyone. And we can make it happen with the web3 infrastructure developed on top of an excellent Substrate framework while adding value to the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nThroughout 2022 and early 2023, the Anagolay team has been building the foundation to make our vision possible. \n\nIncluding, most recently: \n\n- [public identity Verification](https://anagolay.dev/blog/multi-token-community-contributions-for-verified-creators/milestone-1/) and [Tipping](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/708) Pallets delivered under the [W3F grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/anagolay-project-idiyanale-multi-token-community-contributions-for-verified-creators.md)\n- [verification strategy and UI](https://bafybeiai2abe5y2nbgydjopuxhg6sdicim22gu4zgkpmcvu7apurpdlguq.ipfs.anagolay.network/verify-your-domain/) for web-domains verifications\n- [Anagolay browser extension](https://anagolay.dev/blog/chrome_extension/installation-and-step-by-step-tutorial/), for sending tips to verified web domains.\n\nFor more details on what we accomplished last year, feel free to check [this post](https://anagolay.dev/blog/2022-retrospective/).\n\n# Current Proposal Scope & Objectives\n\nOur goal is to empower and support ***independent content creators*** and ***open-source developers***. \n\nWith Anagolay, any verified online identity, like a web (sub)domain, a social media account (Twitter, YouTube, GitHub, etc.), or any Mastodon federated identity, can be used to send and receive funds: as community contributions to support a *verified creator* or their particular project (a repository or even a specific post).\n\nWe’ll start with bringing tip-as-you-go functionality to the ecosystem, making supporting quality work much easier: both from a personal account or by suggesting a tip from the Treasury. By doing so, we are creating additional incentives to contribute to the Polkadot community growth: for the existing members and for all the creators & builders in the digital space. \n\nFrom the get-go, in the current implementation, the tips can be sent in IDI (our native token). Eventually, our goal is to enable tips & recurring contributions in any DotSama token, scale Anagolay solution, and streamline creative workflow from publishing to monetization for all independent creators.\n\n## Value\n\nThe value of Anagolay's solution is three-fold:\n\n- Firstly, it provides content creators and open-source contributors with additional monetization tools.\n- Secondly, it creates an additional incentive for the communities within Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to make and encourage contributions. Tips from the community become a more accessible way to show appreciation for someone's work and can even serve as an alternative to treasury spending.\n- Lastly, by bringing new users into the ecosystem, the solution enhances the ecosystem's overall value.\n\nThe range of communities benefitting from Anagolay will gradually expand as we develop and implement new features: \n\n![Anagolay_audience_map.png](https://ipfs.anagolay.network/ipfs/bafybeigsabemad2cctftxteqhogi44blnaxjyztemd7m376qu7xmnya6dy?anagolay_audience_map.png)\n\nInitially, we aim to put community support & incentivization functionality to the test while adding value within the context of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. This will allow us to collect valuable feedback and prepare for scaling: to onboard wider creative audiences and become their gateway to the ecosystem.\n\nPlease see the [FULL PROPOSAL HERE](https://kelp.notion.site/Anagolay-community-contributions-for-verified-creators-892fef98694b401c87ee2cb72bc885e7) for more details.",

      "content": "Contextual Information by the team, below:\n###\nETH Denver, the flagship event of the Ethereum community draws in a lot of the active community as well as newcomers to the space. By showing up at ETHDenver awareness and builder and developer leads with high interest in blockchain are generated - newbies looking to build their first project and/or contribute to the tech stack, as well as teams already building in the Ethereum community and looking for new project opportunities. In addition to new leads, the event is a great opportunity to connect with those already familiar with Polkadot, and grow the relationship.\n\nPolkadot successfully participated in last year’s edition as a Diamond sponsor, and organized several ETH Denver BUIDLWeek talk sessions. For this year’s event, the goal is to give Polkadot and the ecosystem teams even more visibility and to book a higher-level sponsorship package. The participation would encompass a Cypher sponsorship package, and a mini summit during BUIDLWeek.\n\nThe following teams have confirmed their participation at ETHDenver activities: **Astar, Unique Network, Phala Network, Zeitgeist, Gear, RMRK, OAK Network, Pendulum, Moonbeam, InvArch, Apillon, Crust, Acurast, Manta, Solang, DAM Finance.**\n\nFurther information on the proposal, including milestones, budget, agenda, participants and more can be found on [**THIS LINK!**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WUawdiqvX08wG-BNf0Jc2pYQROfGv7Xj2XZA5x-ofGY/edit)",

We launched our MVP in June 2021 and have been providing free RPC services to the Polkadot ecosystem’s participants since Q3 2021. Our mission is to aid the Polkadot protocol in achieving its vision of a multi-chain future by providing easy-to-use, reliable, and scalable infrastructure services which remove an entire layer of complexities for developers to start building on Polkadot/Substrate.\n\nEcosystem participants can access our free API service by creating their own API Key on Pinknode Portal or using our public endpoints (listed at https://polkadot.js.org/apps). In a bid to reduce barriers to entry and attract more developers to the ecosystem, our premium plan, which includes archival data and higher rate limits, is also free for all builders and participants of Polkadot to utilize.

With a focus on training and support, this program is designed to help developers in India, the second-largest developer community in the world, become proficient in the Polkadot ecosystem. Blockchained India has a proven track record of working with leading blockchain protocols, including Polygon, Cosmos, Zilliqa, ConsenSys, Binance, and is well-suited to guide developers on their journey into the world of Polkadot.\n\n**Recognition of Successful Programs Conducted by Blockchained India**\n\n[100 Days of Code with Zilliqa](https://koinpost.com/2020/09/02/want-to-become-a-blockchain-developer-in-100-days-check-out-100-days-of-code-by-indian-blockchain-community/)\n\n[India’s Largest Dapp Fest](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/india-dapp-fest-2019-first-global-blockchain-meet-up-bengaluru/article27762404.ece)\n\n[ConsenSys India Launch by Blockchained India](https://archive.factordaily.com/ethereum-joseph-lubin-interview-india/)\n\n**Goal**\n\nThe goal is to address the challenges facing Indian developers who want to learn and build on the Polkadot network. Through the \"Polkadot Developer Bootcamp - India\" initiative, we aim to provide access to experienced Web 3.0 teachers and trainers, as well as industry experts, to help young and talented developers learn about the Polkadot network. We also aim to create a supportive and sustainable ecosystem for working developers who want to transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 and explore building solutions on the Polkadot network. This proposal would significantly improve the experience of Indian developers in the Polkadot network and would help build a strong and sustainable community in India.\n\nPlease find the full details of the proposal (including current problem, solutions, milestones, tasks, timelines and costs for the proposal) here:  [Polkadot Developer Bootcamp - India 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vpYrY2aBIuzXf0NaQc2UKL9s6isVbtPDbJHZQhpgEdE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThanks for taking out the time to read through, we would appreciate your feedback and comments. We hope you have a blessed year ahead, full of prosperity and success!",

      "content": "Greetings Council Members!\n\nAs we all witness the rapid growth of WEB3 technologies, it's crucial that we make sure the adoption of these technologies is inclusive and reaches every corner of the world. \n\nThat's why we're excited to introduce **1TRIBE**, a digital multimedia education initiative that empowers Africans to participate in the decentralized WEB3 economy, with a focus on the **Polkadot** ecosystem \n\n\nAfter engaging with the community for [feedback](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1534) through platforms like **AAG** and **The Kusamarian**, we're thrilled to have received a lot of community support. \n\nHowever, some council members abstained from voting and following feedback from members of council and community, we have refined our proposal to better articulate our project.\n\nAs a **pro-African** WEB3 multimedia platform, we know that using all available mediums to disseminate our message of WEB3 education and empowerment to African youth is crucial. That's why we've made it our mission to incorporate an **online radio** format into our platform. Our hybrid platform allows us to convert our series of themed video content into online-radio format, ensuring that our message reaches a wider audience and that none of our content goes to waste.\n\nOur goals for 1TRIBE are simple:\n\n- **Foster** a diverse community of Africans, Africans in the diaspora, and people of African descent from around the world who are interested in Web3 and the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n- **Drive** interest in Web3 and Polkadot by seamlessly incorporating African lifestyle, music, art, and innovation.\n\n- **Educate** Africa's budding entertainers, artists, musicians, and students about the potential of Web3 and Polkadot.\n\n- **Provide** a platform for discussions and education about Web3 and Polkadot.\n\n- **Encourage** the development and growth of the Web3 ecosystem in Africa.\n\nBy achieving these goals, we firmly believe that 1TRIBE will play a vital role in bridging Africa to the future with Polkadot. \n\n- **The Kusamarian** talking about 1TRIBE: [here](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwGWwvRQRRGQ) - kindly start from 1:38:00\n-  **AAG** YouTube live.- [here](https://twitter.com/thekusamarian/status/1615133275944816642?s=46&t=KDYfuaY2d2OeeQpz_7wo6g) - Kindly skip to 14:00\n\nYou can find all details in our full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rbFrMr7vxaObJjHW8MSzfYpI-vfyRY6kEV3QIPFgF10) \n\nOur weekly and Daily Programming [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15REymnJj8Fq0mWzaG9dmkulNXHzhyXzcxjfLi_BgoO0)\n\nOur total budget breakdown [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2HSYvIpxoMMgXPPc_XSu7iBd-bDd_Gd6YQiR3L4HT8) \n\n1TRIBE KPIs and metrics [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnyE0Bd6I9EaCqUwQe89IkMONJx2RSUb-CiD0foY80w)\n\n\n1TRIBE Team [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lSs2UCPODcvVOT0J98IdU_Kn1oJ6MAn0VdOs_aLfO8k) \n\n\nAnkh Wedja Seneb\n\n1TRIBE",

      "content": "Hello community,\n\nThank you for your support and feedback on our original [discussion on the forum ](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-purple-paper-token-morphism-guidelines/2023)for conducting legal research around DOT token morphism. 🙏\nWe are now presenting this proposal after absorbing feedback.\n\n### Context\nIn earlier phases of Web3 - namely 2017 and 2018 - there was extensive debate about the legal nature of tokens and the process for getting those tokens acknowledged by regulatory bodies such as the SEC. Amidst the frenzy of the latest bull run, those debates have somewhat subsided. In a post-FTX market, with even more scrutinous regulatory eyes fixed upon crypto, those debates and the need for best practices for undergoing regulatory recognition have reemerged as even more critical pieces of knowledge for web3 builders. In this environment, Polkadot’s efforts and ultimate success in the regulatory arena warrant study and dissemination to the wider web3 community. It is in this spirit that we submit our grant request to the treasury\n\nWe have already had informal discussions with the individuals most involved in the DOT related regulatory process, who all expressed initial interest in contributing to the initiative. Given this, we feel confident in our ability to fully develop our research themes.\n\nThe professionals we spoke with who manifested in general terms willingness to support the initiative are:\n\n[Joshua Ashley Klayman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-ashley-klayman/)\n\n[Angela Dalton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/angela-dalton/)\n\n[Chrissy Hill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrissy-hill-aa76828/)\n\n[Daniel Schoenberger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-schoenberger-9107836/)\n\nWe aim to produce a Research paper regarding the SEC DOT regulatory process, outcomes and recommendations for Dotsama and the wider Web3 ecosystem.

The last edition took place in LX-Factory in Lisbon on November 28th and 29th, 2022, Web3 Foundation, together with the teams of Apillon, Phala Network, Astar Network and Manta Network in representation of the entire Polkadot ecosystem brought together the global Polkadot developer community.\n\nSub0 will again provide an open introduction to next-generation multichain networks, as well as a chance for existing Polkadot and Substrate developers to deepen their skills and connect with each other. For this year's edition we want 50% of our audience to be new developers from outside of our ecosystem. This includes people who are not building on Substrate but are curious to learn more. By opening our doors to developers who are not (or only slightly) familiar with our tech, we can bring in more potential builders and expand our market reach and visibility. \n\nTHIS IS THE FUNDING REQUEST FOR MILESTONE 1 AS PER THE BUDGET DETAILED IN THE DOC BELOW.\n\nFurther information on the proposal, including milestones, budget, agenda, participants and more can be found on [THIS LINK](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11eaFr7OlOGOIQpskRopBUR_KizmHRmd3U-QRmcyA_g0/edit?usp=sharing)!",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nWe're proud to present our next proposal from the Sublab team which primary focus is on developing tools for developers in Substrate ecosystem. This proposal is published after 10 days since the discussion was published.\n\nPlease feel free to read the full proposal document at this link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ipyb2_d1d9FCYY4Xp3aRi5CZmZJOzbqBZ50hQMerUI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ipyb2_d1d9FCYY4Xp3aRi5CZmZJOzbqBZ50hQMerUI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://sublab.dev/logo.png)\n\n**Context of proposal**\n\n[sublab.dev](https://sublab.dev) is the California based company designated to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community. \n\nWe've recently finished our [very first proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/532) within which we created 13 Swift and Kotlin repositories to operate with Substrate networks. While we have basic functionality, we still need to develop more features to reach current ecosystem state and its functionality. Also, we agreed to collaborate with a couple of projects in ecosystem to develop base SDKs for their services in Swift and Kotlin, and chose extra providers to develop SDKs for, which cover most popular functionality in mobile applications. Furthermore, we now seek to make our Kotlin libraries be written fully in Kotlin and use only Kotlin libraries so that we can make our libraries ready for Kotlin Multi Platform.\n\nThis proposal is expected to be a first step out of two in series of milestones to come as close as possible to current ecosystem state. Also next milestone is suppose to cover improvements/fixes to existing libraries and more collaborations.\n\n**What we're trying to accomplish within this milestone**\n\nMost of our efforts are projected to be put into Substrate client we made for Swift and Kotlin. \n\nPrimary purpose is to create pre-created set of models and functionality like popular and common between all networks constants, storage queries, functions and events, so end developer will not need to always write boilerplate code. This potentially saves thousands of hours if we take into consideration multiple teams working with these libraries. Also we want to boost our extrinsic service to have all day-to-day methods in it: fees estimation, transfers, batch requests, and so on.\n\nSecondly, we want to develop special manager which will be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous clients at the same time. Mobile devices even though they're powerful nowadays still not almighty. Application sandbox is limited, thus in order to work with many networks in parallel we wish to create set of functions and classes which will be responsible for turning on and off all clients depending on current app function optimizing CPU and RAM usage. \n\nTo make this manager it's also needed to have some caching mechanism: we propose to create a database which will be responsible for storing everything from these multiple connections, work with pre-defined common constants, storage queries, functions, and events, combining everything together to speed up and optimize cold and hot starts of Substrate client instances.\n\nLast but not least part of Substrate client improvements in this milestone is to provide support to work with all existing parachains. Every network has their own runtime which sometime differs very much. So we look forward to create as many as possible unit tests to check compatibility of our Substrate client with every existing parachain today. Indeed this would require a lot of internal client changes. So we will do our best to keep our codebase clean and tidy, and at the same time powerful to handle dozens of different networks, and hundreds of connections.\n\nAlso, in this proposal we're looking forward to making a set of small libraries to provide SDK interface to most popular block explorers which are used for fetching history and many more: SubQuery, Subsquid and Subscan. For now, we decided to develop basic interface so that we don't dive too deep into all functionality and get burden of supporting it all. In this proposal we want to provide functionality that allows developers to use all of the service features, but maybe with small tweaks. However, we might find some solutions to do later to optimize and avoid this extra customization. As extra, there will be couple of token/fiat exchange rate resolvers to choose from.\n\nIn parallel, there are two small projects. Provide Combine interface in our Swift libraries so that Swift developers can choose what asynchronous approach they would like to use in their application. And Kotlinization. This is very special project for us: we have created a few of libraries in Kotlin from scratch like schnorrkel algorithm. And since we still rely on some Java libraries, it is not that easy to make our Kotlin libraries compatible with Kotlin Multi Platform. This technology opens a big opportunity to use our libraries in many different platforms from mobile applications to web, so we're encouraged to make our libraries ready for this bright future.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nWe want the Substrate ecosystem developers to just do brand new features to make the ecosystem richer and be recognizable by even more people around the globe, while we can hold their backs by doing a great infrastructural work. We want to see more mobile apps in the ecosystem either from existing parachains to launch their own apps or absolutely new mobile wallets with more innovative functions. Same we want to help existing applications by solving their core issues within our works and help them adopt our products. Also we aim to partner with as much as possible existing networks and/or companies who already deliver their services to ecosystem, so that even their products might be easy accessible via reliable SDKs.\n\n**Proposal financing and deliverables**\n\nWe're requesting $259,500 for the current milestone which includes improvements to existing Substrate clients, SDKs for block explorers and currency exchange rate providers, adding Combine interface to Swift libraries and migrating our Kotlin libraries to use only Kotlin, not Java dependencies. Each part is planned to be released separately and sequentially along with publications to public package managers' repositories, as well as on our GitHub for a review. Also we're planning announcements on our Telegram channel and future Medium blog with a brief description of deliverables. And in the end when we finish documentation part we're going to publish on-chain report with appropriate links to the open source code, package managers' repositories, our articles on Medium, and links to documentation website ([https://docs.sublab.dev](https://docs.sublab.dev))\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you any constructive feedback and/or questions regarding our planned works. Feel free to refer to our [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ipyb2_d1d9FCYY4Xp3aRi5CZmZJOzbqBZ50hQMerUI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSincerely,\nSublab team",

      "content": "This proposal aims to change the configuration of three operations on: Fast-unstake pallet, Staking pallet, Nomination pools pallet, particularly:\n\n1. Increasing the minimum number of tokens to create a nomination pool **from 200 DOT to 500 DOT**.\n\n2. Increasing the bond size required to become a direct nominator from **100 DOT to 250 DOT**.\n\n3. **Enabling fast unstake** on Polkadot: this has been well tested in Kusama, and is ready to go 🚀. Read about fast unstake [here](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/path-to-fast-unstake-in-polkadot-kusama/1539) or [here](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1625550205960523780).\n\n4. Increasing the number of validator candidates **from 1200 to 1500** in anticipation of an increase in the active set of validators\n\n5. **Increasing the number of pools to 256**: given the successful launch of Pools so far on Polkadot, and the network having almost the full list of 128 pools, I propose doubling the maximum count again to 256.\n\nThe previous discussion on this proposal can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1650). \n\n- Call data: `0x1a000c28020100000007160100a89c13460200000000000000000000000001dc0500000000270b0001005039278c040000000000000000000001000100000000`\n\n- Call hash: `0x4d779af12cec076f6dfe5b6087746b501592222bbcee70ff6ec51825eb389dde`\n\nPreimage can be checked [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x1a000c28020100000007160100a89c13460200000000000000000000000001dc0500000000270b0001005039278c040000000000000000000001000100000000).\n\nPlease nots this is submitted as an external motion: meaning if/after Council approves, the proposal will need to be up for vote by the community in referenda queue for the final decision. \n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "title": "Fix genesis registration for Manta Parachain",
      "content": "A proposal requested by the Manta team to register a new genesis wasm. Contextual information below:\n\n**What Happened**\n\nOur parathread was registered on the Polkadot relaychain, obtained a parachain slot and was upgraded to a parachain. However, we encountered a minor setback when the genesis collators failed to produce blocks on the new chain. It turns out that the registration process contained incompatible genesis WASM and state files, which caused our parachain to be stuck at genesis.\n\n**Impact / why fast-track?**\n\nAfter the acquisition of a parachain slot, Manta Network’s core development team has begun a sequence for launching the network. Not having this parachain producing blocks would prevent and delay that launch. The extrinsics called in our proposal affect just our 2104 parachain and it has not completed genesis, so there are no XCMP channels to worry about either, the relaychain should be unaffected by this.\n\n**Remedy** \n\nAfter thorough investigation and collaboration with the Parity development team, we've identified a solution to the issue. With assistance from Polkadot governance, we can correct the incompatible parachain state & WASM files that were originally registered. This correction will not have any impact or loss of state since the chain has never produced any blocks. We believe that this is the most efficient and effective solution to get our parachain up and running.\n\n**Council Proposal**\n\nWe humbly request that the technical committee fast-track the proposal to register the correct genesis state and code on Polkadot. This will allow our collators to begin producing blocks.\n\nWe have submitted the Preimage for the below proposal:\n\nhash: `0x2d1b0d07d86ebe11297eb5a732d5d56e2b118eb1e8e55b0bdc801c5d313371c9`\n\nin extrinsic [https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/14362712-2](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/14362712-2) from the same account as was used to originally register the paraID/parathread in [https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/13905786-2](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/13905786-2).\n\n**Extrinsics called:**\n\n`batchAll()`\n\n`    - registrar::setCurrentHead(2104, corrected.state)`\n\n`    - paras::forceSetCurrentCode(2104, corrected.wasm)`\n\nNew WASM file can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta/actions/runs/4234987640).\n\nregistrar.paras(2104) => manager: 15ynbcMgPf7HbQErRz66RDLMuBVdcWVuURhR4SLPiqa6B8jx\n\nGist by the CEO of Manta Network Shumo Chu: [https://gist.github.com/stechu/9c97c7766951d377accd8835e5da79fb](https://gist.github.com/stechu/9c97c7766951d377accd8835e5da79fb)\n\nMessage Text:\n\n\"This shall serve to testify that the following Polkadot governance referendum has been initiated and is endorsed by the Manta Network team  - Referendum number: TBD - Proposal hash: 0x2d1b0d07d86ebe11297eb5a732d5d56e2b118eb1e8e55b0bdc801c5d313371c9 - Polkassembly discussion: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/362\"\n\nsignature from the account that registered paraID 2104: `0x2478a5e64e8c7915e12ca048a2dfb5d04ff97f188fc1f7948bd77c19446fd421af3555a96ebbb1720b7ac1c548877ff8fc9ad12dcbf095f0aef9d8f54b444087`",

      "title": "Grabber, a tool that incentivizes experts and leaders within the community to boost governance engagement and voter activity.",
      "content": "Dear Polkadot Community! \nWe are submitting a proposal for a governance incentivization tool, that helps incentivize experts and leaders within the community to boost governance engagement and voter activity.\n\n**[Get the detailed Proposal here >>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit)**\n\n### **Overview**\nWhile the concept of cryptocurrencies can be considered validated, the concept of cryptocurrency governance is still evolving. The objective of “basic” cryptocurrency governance (as a decentralized management system for that particular cryptocurrency ecosystem) is to perform decentralized control over the process, support developments, and manage the ecosystem's existence. The main goal is to ensure the long-term sustainability, security, and adaptability of a network while increasing the wealth locked in the ecosystem and the holdings of its participants, which are directly connected to the ecosystem's overall wealth. “Basic” cryptocurrency governance refers to the “tactical” decision-making processes. It helps address critical issues such as protocol upgrades, funding for development, conflict resolution, and network security. Even at this level, governance encounters numerous issues and opportunistic behavior from users, such as fraud, Sybil attacks, vote borrowing, voting manipulation, and participants' opportunism, among others. \n\nPolkadot's governance model is designed to prioritize the growth and development of the platform's ecosystem, rather than focusing solely on partnerships or marketing. This strategic approach stems from Polkadot's L0 vision as a foundation for future Layer 1 (L1) blockchains and its Substrate framework, which simplifies the process of building and deploying customized blockchains (also platform).\nWe can refer to Polkadot governance as \"builders\" governance, which emphasizes the platform's commitment to nurturing and supporting the creation of a robust ecosystem. This type of governance fosters collaboration and innovation within the community by allocating resources from the treasury to projects that contribute to the platform's growth, enhance its functionality, or expand its capabilities. In essence, \"builders\" governance concentrates on strategic objectives rather than tactical ones, prioritizing the development and evolution of the ecosystem over merely maintaining its current state. This approach ensures that Polkadot continues to evolve and adapt, making it a more resilient and future-proof platform that can support a diverse range of blockchain applications and use cases.\n\nPolkadot's governance requires voters to have deep expertise and take on significantly higher risks, both within the large ecosystem and the market as a whole. Additionally, due to the break in cause-and-effect relationships, voters must make decisions without the possibility of receiving feedback or personal benefits. Furthermore, voters must also lock up their funds in the process. This is an important aspect of the system, as it helps to ensure voters' commitment and alignment with the long-term interests of the ecosystem. \n[You can learn more about \"builder\" governance in our proposal >>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit#)\n\nHowever, it can be confidently said that one of the biggest challenges of this type of DAO is the enormous amount of time that needs to be spent collectively on studying community proposals. If we assume that each proposal takes 5.5 hours for adequate study (the average time spent on studying a scientific paper by an expert), then 1000 voters will spend 5,500 hours on a single proposal (excluding those who could not handle it, did not study it, or did not vote).\nThen 20 proposals will take up 110,000 hours. That is 68+ full-time experts working on this exclusively.\nHence, an obvious task is to reduce the time it takes for a community member to study one proposal. The organization and simplification, preferably with added interest, can be improved in the scheme of such governance.\n\nThere are several ways to lower the barrier to entry for studying proposals and increase the chances of engaging a voter:\n- Train the required number of voters  \n- Delegate votes to the most motivated members, who are ready to do deep research \n- Add formal proposal compliance analyses\n- Provide volunteer analyses and reports.\n\n[Each of these solutions has its pros and cons, and you can learn more about them by following the link >>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit#)\n\n\n### **The ideal concept proposes the following solution**\nDrawing from existing experience, we can create a decentralized group of competing experts who can generate reviews of proposals. Their work will significantly reduce the need for ordinary voters to deeply engage with proposals, as they will be able to prepare reports that allow for direct insight. Decentralization and competition will facilitate the formation of diverse opinions and prevent an unconstructive approach. Moreover, these experts can become vote delegates who are also in competition. This work should be minimally incentivized, as reviewers provide a public good.\n\n### **Grabber incentivization challenge concept.**\nTo implement commitment, user reputation, and actual actions and delegation of allocations and payments, have a reputation system within the system. It will be able to collect and analyze experts in the system and commitment. Based on this reputational tool, collective incentivization can work: bounties will be allocated, for which different experts will compete. Users will be able to vote on whose impact was more useful to them, thereby distributing the bounty. The results of their voting will again generate on-chain events that will enrich the participants' reputations.\nThe general scheme of work will be as follows:\n\n1. For each proposal, a research budget is allocated, which allows compensation for researchers' expenses (bounty). For this, an event with conditions is created in the system.\n2. Researchers can register in the system and conduct research, uploading links to them in the interface. Research is done within a specific timeframe.\n3. After that, the proposed posts are reviewed, and points are assigned. Together with the relevance of their experience, they receive accruals from the allocated fund. When considering the researcher's relevance, it is visible how often they vote/voted/parachain auctions/funds in the system, etc.\n4. The experience of researchers improves with the number of payments they receive (this is also collected on-chain and displayed).\n5. The result is deep, non-formal research from multiple authors, which significantly reduces the workload for the community.\n\n\n\n### **Grabber: A tool with an experienced team and Polkadot traction.**\n\nTeam:\nDev: Experienced with RUST, WASM/EVM (DOT) smart-contracts, Polkadot.js, and Polkadot features.\nCommunity: Well-connected in the Polkadot community, with existing DOT/eco communities event traction and a large existing community.\n\n### **Battle-tested flow**\n\nWe already have:\n1. User onboarding flow \n2. Community UI\n3. Administration UI\n4. Parachain-ready (EVM/WASM ready)\n\n### **Interface sketches**\n\nTrack selection\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/1.jpg)\n\nProject selection\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/2.jpg)\n\nProject Interface\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/3.jpg)\n\nVoting “Back office” and “event” UX\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/4.jpg)\n\nThe voting manager creates an event and provides all necessary info to Grabber through our “back office”. \n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/5.jpg)\n\nThere are many competitions that can be managed\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/6.jpg)\n\nResults control \n\n\nUser UX:\n\nUsers apply for the claim. To apply, they bind their source wallet (DOT) and their distribution wallet (Smart-contract based parachain wallet/EVM wallet). Grabber's system aggregates crowdloan and voting activity of the users and proposes to save it on-chain. (in the smart-contract based parachain).\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/7.jpg)\n\nGrabber front-end already supports major Polkadot/EVM wallets, detects extensions and helps these wallets receive new users (check grabber.network). Also additional popups added\n![](https://ipfs.thirdwebcdn.com/ipfs/QmevBAAarxd4rTTCRySkXyhFPt4Ev6z1fbTshtHBWGoaNi/8.jpg)\n\n### Grabber | Algem\n- Fully qualified (scored) users found to fit all criteria requested by the company: 532\n- Users registered in Grabber for event: >5100\n- Verified their wallets in Grabber: >3100 (60.87%)\n- Event registrations (on-chain): **2735**\n- Impressions for event-related Tweets from [@Grabberofficial](https://twitter.com/grabberofficial): >20K\n- Increase in the number of Algem’s followers after the event: 16.48%\n- Grabber x Algem smart-contract: [https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0xC00ba642fbB807B6e7A45fDAC4D2061d961fd272](https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0xC00ba642fbB807B6e7A45fDAC4D2061d961fd272)\n\n### Grabber | Astar\n- Fully qualified (scored) users found to fit all criteria requested by the company: 148\n- Users registered in Grabber for the event: >2100\n- Verified their wallets in Grabber: >1420 (67.62%)\n- Event registrations (on-chain): **957**\n- Impressions for event-related Tweets from @Grabber :>41K\n- Grabber x Astar smart-contract: [https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x76d46248F66Afb7767BA7C449748550926908DC4](https://blockscout.com/astar/address/0x76d46248F66Afb7767BA7C449748550926908DC4)\n\n[More numbers about this evets available in the Detailed Proposal: ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1go3e3yeuXN31nuDtqabvMr_LM70cdtTqXZT_WqsF0Ks/edit)\n\n\n### **Grabber's Potential Impact**\n\n1.

To raise Polkadot’s profile in India and promote education and engagement, along with others with connections to industry and the Indian blockchain communities, I am organizing **Polkadot Now India**. The conference aims to bring together developers, researchers, media, investors, and other stakeholders to experience the Polkadot ecosystem, share knowledge and discover new collaboration opportunities for the entire ecosystem.\n\nFollow Us: [Telegram ](https://t.me/PolkadotNowindia), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PolkadotNowInd).\n\n[Website ](https://www.PolkadotNowIndia.com)will go live on 28th Feb, 2023. followed by opening of registrations on 6th March, 2023.\n\nOur comprehensive proposal can be accessed via the [link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RfYNmAShEARdmsAOCL0nQChWK7rzSK2Yy4UyU43Eijs/edit?usp=sharing)provided.",

      "title": "Multix - A simple interface to manage complex multisigs",
      "content": "As you may have heard recently, Chainsafe has built an early version of [Multix](https://multix.chainsafe.io), an interface to manage complex multisigs.\nThe alpha version is already live! \n\nWe are aware that the multisig interface landscape has been busy in the past weeks, but we believe that we provide a solution that is outstanding:\n- it's already live,  you can already see the power of what we will iterate on.\n- unlike any other solution proposed out there, it's based on proxies, giving immense flexibility while keeping a great UX. \n- it's trust minimized and open. There is no private database needed other than a Subsquid indexer. You are not locked-in and can still use polkadot-js/apps in parallel if you want.\n- it's open source, because we believe in healthy competition. Our ideas will be copied, hopefully with attribution!\n\nPolkadot and Kusama have the lego pieces ready to use for enterprises and DAOs to create multisigs that are flexible enough for their needs. However, the actual day-to-day handling of these multisigs is a huge burden. It is not user friendly, error prone, and time intensive. From our interviews with businesses and DAOs that use multisigs, they all use at least one proxy, and often even many more. This gives them the flexibility they need, but it also makes the management of the multisig harder when using polkadot-js/apps. Also we believe that flexible multisigs should be accessible to everyone, not only businesses.   \n\n\nIf you build a multisig with your friends Alice and Bob, and Bob looses his private key, you will have to create a new multisig and transfer your funds/NFT. You may even be locked for a while because of staking/voting. Also your address will be different! This is dramatic! Unlike any solution out there, Multix uses proxies,  thanks to this, you can change Bob's key, and you won't have to touch the funds/NFTs or unstake. Also very important, you don't have to understand deeply how proxies work, the interface is easy to use regardless.  \n\n\nThanks to our deep experience of the ecosystem, Multix was built in a record time. If you want to know more about it [see this article](https://blog.chainsafe.io/multix-a-simple-interface-to-manage-complex-multisigs-on-polkadot-97328be26f9d).  \n\nWe would like to request ~150 000$ from the treasury to fund the development of new features for the next 5 months.\nSee the full [proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1euTuMEFSBwFf4cRVLK8sshI9PgdR5-Qg4ciDN4WJpaA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nFor those who want to have a quick look at Multix, I made a video to showcase why proxies are awesome, and how you can swap a multisig behind a proxy, with a couple clicks. This feature isn't live yet, but I have it mostly done already, as you can see.\n\n[Check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APxPsawebJw)\n",

      "content": "[YieldBay](https://list.yieldbay.io/) is a yield farm aggregator for the dotsama ecosystem. Our goal with YieldBay is two-fold:\n\n1. To reduce information asymmetry and lower the barrier to entry for liquidity providers and yield farmers\n2. To make it easier for protocols to acquire liquidity for their token pools\n\n\nThis is a follow-up to [our previous treasury proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fssDqgPtIjdwO0XfJW5po94JHMf1ozdjeLwM2a40zJ8/edit?usp=sharing) ([Motion #262](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/262) on Polkassembly) to build further on our goal of reducing information asymmetry in finding and participating in liquidity pools and yield farms in the dotsama ecosystem.\n\nAs outlined in our previous proposal's problem statement and illustrated below in the screenshot of feedback from community members — participating in yield farms in the dotsama ecosystem is a tedious and time consuming process.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/nL86ZKgm/collage.png\" width=\"400px\" alt=\"Information asymmetry in finding and participating in liquidity pools and yield farms\" />\n\n\nWith our previous proposal, we built an aggregated list of yield farms, which allows users to discover all major yield farms across the ecosystem and allows protocols to increase visibility of their liquidity pools and yield farms. The current version of this product is live on [https://list.yieldbay.io/](https://list.yieldbay.io)\n\nIn this proposal, we are seeking to fund the development of an aggregated yield farming dashboard to allow users to participate in dotsama yield farms as well as monitor and manage their positions from one central location.\n\n<br />\n\n**Progress so far:**\n\n- [YieldBay list](https://list.yieldbay.io), the yield farm listing platform funded by the Polkadot Treasury as [Motion #262](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/262) on Polkassembly tracks over **$92M+ TVL** across **15 protocols**\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/HayNXAN.png\" width=\"300px\" alt=\"YB List Metrics\" />\n- The platform has had **4.3k** unique visitors who spent an average time of over **3min** on the site\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UT5Mu23.png\" width=\"600px\" alt=\"YB List Metrics\" />\n\n**NOTE:** This submission is only for the first milestone. We shall make separate submissions for payment of the remaining milestones upon completion of delivery.\n\nPlease see the [full proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GQQOEZ3ZW3wQ9GH0fv7na8evmBcBc_Tamf2ulor2bqI/edit?usp=sharing).",

EasyA will then hold 2 in-person hackathons in world-leading hubs London, UK and Boston, US for developers to participate in the final showdown and showcase what they’ve learnt. We aim to get 1,000 developers completing the crash course fully, and 400 developers to our 2 in-person hackathons. The goal: educate thousands of developers on Polkadot, reach millions on social media, and get #60DaysOfPolkadot trending in developer communities worldwide!\nThis builds on the massive success of the original ['Hello World' Polkadot Gitcoin challenges](https://gitcoin.co/hackathon/polkadot/), which kickstarted the whole Polkadot developer community.\n\nThis proposal is supported by the Acala, Astar, Composable, and Moonbeam parachains, as well as ecosystem projects including Subsquid, Gear and others. All ecosystem teams are welcomed to get involved too!\n\n**Objectives:**\n* Educate 1,000 developers on Polkadot and the ecosystem\n* Produce 100 new projects on Polkadot and parachains by the end of the hackathon series\n* Maximise the quality of submissions at Polkadot hackathons\n* Increase awareness and adoption of Polkadot and parachains\n* Introduce individuals to programming on Polkadot and parachains\n* Create long-lasting content to benefit newcomers to Polkadot and parachains\n\n**See the proposal link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dgfiAwKU3cM-2MmWfCkULHNZYlrMU9ayJ5oDKvmZMQQ/edit?usp=sharing)**!",

      "title": "Sublab proposal #DOT-1: Substrate client improvements, ecosystem tools, and Kotlinization",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nWe're proud to present our next proposal from the Sublab team which primary focus is on developing tools for developers in Substrate ecosystem. This proposal is published after 10 days since the discussion was published.\n\nPlease feel free to read the full proposal document at this link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ipyb2_d1d9FCYY4Xp3aRi5CZmZJOzbqBZ50hQMerUI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ipyb2_d1d9FCYY4Xp3aRi5CZmZJOzbqBZ50hQMerUI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://sublab.dev/logo.png)\n\n**Context of proposal**\n\n[sublab.dev](https://sublab.dev) is the California based company designated to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community. \n\nWe've recently finished our [very first proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/532) within which we created 13 Swift and Kotlin repositories to operate with Substrate networks. While we have basic functionality, we still need to develop more features to reach current ecosystem state and its functionality. Also, we agreed to collaborate with a couple of projects in ecosystem to develop base SDKs for their services in Swift and Kotlin, and chose extra providers to develop SDKs for, which cover most popular functionality in mobile applications. Furthermore, we now seek to make our Kotlin libraries be written fully in Kotlin and use only Kotlin libraries so that we can make our libraries ready for Kotlin Multi Platform.\n\nThis proposal is expected to be a first step out of two in series of milestones to come as close as possible to current ecosystem state. Also next milestone is suppose to cover improvements/fixes to existing libraries and more collaborations.\n\n**What we're trying to accomplish within this milestone**\n\nMost of our efforts are projected to be put into Substrate client we made for Swift and Kotlin. \n\nPrimary purpose is to create pre-created set of models and functionality like popular and common between all networks constants, storage queries, functions and events, so end developer will not need to always write boilerplate code. This potentially saves thousands of hours if we take into consideration multiple teams working with these libraries. Also we want to boost our extrinsic service to have all day-to-day methods in it: fees estimation, transfers, batch requests, and so on.\n\nSecondly, we want to develop special manager which will be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous clients at the same time. Mobile devices even though they're powerful nowadays still not almighty. Application sandbox is limited, thus in order to work with many networks in parallel we wish to create set of functions and classes which will be responsible for turning on and off all clients depending on current app function optimizing CPU and RAM usage. \n\nTo make this manager it's also needed to have some caching mechanism: we propose to create a database which will be responsible for storing everything from these multiple connections, work with pre-defined common constants, storage queries, functions, and events, combining everything together to speed up and optimize cold and hot starts of Substrate client instances.\n\nLast but not least part of Substrate client improvements in this milestone is to provide support to work with all existing parachains. Every network has their own runtime which sometime differs very much. So we look forward to create as many as possible unit tests to check compatibility of our Substrate client with every existing parachain today. Indeed this would require a lot of internal client changes. So we will do our best to keep our codebase clean and tidy, and at the same time powerful to handle dozens of different networks, and hundreds of connections.\n\nAlso, in this proposal we're looking forward to making a set of small libraries to provide SDK interface to most popular block explorers which are used for fetching history and many more: SubQuery, Subsquid and Subscan. For now, we decided to develop basic interface so that we don't dive too deep into all functionality and get burden of supporting it all. In this proposal we want to provide functionality that allows developers to use all of the service features, but maybe with small tweaks. However, we might find some solutions to do later to optimize and avoid this extra customization. As extra, there will be couple of token/fiat exchange rate resolvers to choose from.\n\nIn parallel, there are two small projects. Provide Combine interface in our Swift libraries so that Swift developers can choose what asynchronous approach they would like to use in their application. And Kotlinization. This is very special project for us: we have created a few of libraries in Kotlin from scratch like schnorrkel algorithm. And since we still rely on some Java libraries, it is not that easy to make our Kotlin libraries compatible with Kotlin Multi Platform. This technology opens a big opportunity to use our libraries in many different platforms from mobile applications to web, so we're encouraged to make our libraries ready for this bright future.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nWe want the Substrate ecosystem developers to just do brand new features to make the ecosystem richer and be recognizable by even more people around the globe, while we can hold their backs by doing a great infrastructural work. We want to see more mobile apps in the ecosystem either from existing parachains to launch their own apps or absolutely new mobile wallets with more innovative functions. Same we want to help existing applications by solving their core issues within our works and help them adopt our products. Also we aim to partner with as much as possible existing networks and/or companies who already deliver their services to ecosystem, so that even their products might be easy accessible via reliable SDKs.\n\n**Proposal financing and deliverables**\n\nWe're requesting $259,500 for the current milestone which includes improvements to existing Substrate clients, SDKs for block explorers and currency exchange rate providers, adding Combine interface to Swift libraries and migrating our Kotlin libraries to use only Kotlin, not Java dependencies. Each part is planned to be released separately and sequentially along with publications to public package managers' repositories, as well as on our GitHub for a review. Also we're planning announcements on our Telegram channel and future Medium blog with a brief description of deliverables. And in the end when we finish documentation part we're going to publish on-chain report with appropriate links to the open source code, package managers' repositories, our articles on Medium, and links to documentation website ([https://docs.sublab.dev](https://docs.sublab.dev))\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you any constructive feedback and/or questions regarding our planned works. Feel free to refer to our [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ipyb2_d1d9FCYY4Xp3aRi5CZmZJOzbqBZ50hQMerUI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSincerely,\nSublab team",

Our hybrid platform allows us to convert our series of themed video content into online-radio format, ensuring that our message reaches a wider audience and that none of our content goes to waste.\n\nOur goals for 1TRIBE are simple:\n\n- **Foster** a diverse community of Africans, Africans in the diaspora, and people of African descent from around the world who are interested in Web3 and the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n- **Drive** interest in Web3 and Polkadot by seamlessly incorporating African lifestyle, music, art, and innovation.\n\n- **Educate** Africa's budding entertainers, artists, musicians, and students about the potential of Web3 and Polkadot.\n\n- **Provide** a platform for discussions and education about Web3 and Polkadot.\n\n- **Encourage** the development and growth of the Web3 ecosystem in Africa.\n\nBy achieving these goals, we firmly believe that 1TRIBE will play a vital role in bridging Africa to the future with Polkadot. \n\n- **The Kusamarian** talking about 1TRIBE: [here](https://twitter.com/i/spaces/1OwGWwvRQRRGQ) - kindly start from 1:38:00\n-  **AAG** YouTube live.- [here](https://twitter.com/thekusamarian/status/1615133275944816642?s=46&t=KDYfuaY2d2OeeQpz_7wo6g) - Kindly skip to 14:00\n\nYou can find all details in our full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rbFrMr7vxaObJjHW8MSzfYpI-vfyRY6kEV3QIPFgF10) \n\nOur weekly and Daily Programming [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15REymnJj8Fq0mWzaG9dmkulNXHzhyXzcxjfLi_BgoO0)\n\nOur total budget breakdown [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2HSYvIpxoMMgXPPc_XSu7iBd-bDd_Gd6YQiR3L4HT8) \n\n1TRIBE KPIs and metrics [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wnyE0Bd6I9EaCqUwQe89IkMONJx2RSUb-CiD0foY80w)\n\n\n1TRIBE Team [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lSs2UCPODcvVOT0J98IdU_Kn1oJ6MAn0VdOs_aLfO8k) \n\n\nAnkh Wedja Seneb\n\n1TRIBE",

      "title": "Unbrick Zeitgeist Parachain",
      "content": "Based on the conversations the Zeitgeist team had with TC in the last days, and taking into account the same issue appeared for the team on Kusama and the fix was approved by the community (see [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/251)), this proposal is now submitted as external motion for consideration of the Council, before making it to referenda queue for the final decision. \n\nYou can find the contextual information on this proposal by the Zeitgeist team [HERE](https://hackmd.io/PXotv7zMTSOphZFg4f99iQ) or below:\n\n### What Happened\n\nThe runtime that is now deployed on Polkadot was prepared before the ParaId was obtained. During local testing rococo-local was used as the relay chain. The parachain was onboarded using another ParaId than the one within the runtime and the parachain was capable of producing blocks and functioning as expected. Assuming that everything is fine, the same runtime was used to bid in the parachain auction using a different ParaId than the one noted in the prepared runtime. As it turns out, the parachain is uncapable of producing blocks on Polkadot due to a ParaId mismatch.\n\nAbout the same time Zeitgeist also bid for a slot on Kusama to execute a slot lease swap. The testing procedure was the same and also resulted in success, however the chain was also uncapable of producing blocks. If those two events were temporaly further apart, the human error would only have happened once. Unfortunately we are forced into the highly aggrevating situation to ask the governance body twice to fix our Parachain, once for Kusama (proposal) and once for Polkadot.\n\n### Remedy\n\nTo fix the bricked chain, the chainspec used for Zeitgeist’s parachain on Polkadot must use 2092 within ParachainInfo::ParaId. To inform Polkadot about the new state root that results from the updated chainspec, paras.forceSetCurrentHead(2092, genesisHead) has to be invoked by the Root origin, whereas genesisHead is set to the resulting genesis state head that is derived from the new chainspec.\n\nWe also want to supply a new runtime. It is much more recent (polkadot-v0.9.29 instead of polkadot-v0.9.19).\n\n### Council Proposal\n\nWe are aware of the recent discussion around the technical council circumventing due process on governance here: [https://forum.polkadot.network/t/how-to-recover-a-parachain/673/23](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/how-to-recover-a-parachain/673/23) and withdrawing from fixing broken parachains. However there is currently not a best practice solution other then avoiding mistakes.\n\nOur humble request to the Technical Committee is to fast-rack this proposal, this is purely a technical hotfix to get the chain started the first time. \n\n### Proof of Authenticity\n\nTo proof that this request is authentic, the manager of ParaId 2092 does provide a signed statement of approval.\n\nManager (`registrar.paras(2092)`): `15Q7heNtPy5vaZ79c3eUt7M42Ao3okf7PKKdRDULBz3Z4UyF`\n\nStatement: [1675099734007] I hereby approve the deployment of the genesis state `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000c2e17f26b505c2be4dcefd0ebfd3abe4536fcc86ded7329af33ddd0a9496db9a03170a2e7597b7b7e3d84c05391d139a62b157e78786d8c082f29dcf4c11131400` and the genesis wasm with the blake2-256 hash `0xa4fe96b65d8f78a7f92d1b7eb917ca501518b6910bee573565d16a911fb91a14` for ParaId 2092 on Polkadot\n\nSignature: `0x6a87523b11d4dd17411c3d9ebed91175dafed6b570014b164074b54b3b2c2b147574a9a5e3f2a25dfcd15340617c4df0730302f51016d5264257e7e8b0c39880`\n\n### \n\n**PLEASE NOTE THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBMITTED AS AN EXTERNAL MOTION: MEANING IF/AFTER COUNCIL APPROVAL, THE COMMUNITY WILL HAVE THE FINAL DECISION ON THE PROPOSAL IN REFERENDA QUEUE. ALSO NOTE [REFERENDUM 103](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referendum/103), SUBMITTED BY THE ZEITGEIST TEAM, AIMS TO EXECUTE THE SAME PROPOSAL: HOWEVER THE TEAM HAS PUBLICLY DISCUSSED 56 DAYS FOR ENACTMENT IS A LONG TIME TO WAIT FOR A FIX. IF THIS PROPOSAL PASSES, THEN REFERENDUM 103 WILL NEED TO BE CANCELED OR DOWNVOTED.**\n\n### \n\nMake sure to review and vote at you convenience!",

We believe in a future where everyone has freedom via true agency over their intentions and finances, and we believe that DotSama will bring this to fruition. \n\nFor more on Talisman’s mission and approach, please see Agyle’s talk at Polkadot Decoded: [Polkadot Decoded 2022: Traverse the Paraverse: How Talisman is bringing multi-chain to the masses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tZjVv70Jk)\n\nAnd Jonathan’s talk about wallet UX at the Sub0 developer conference:\n[Talisman: The UX Chronicles: How To Deliver A Substrate Experience To The Masses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_xiMaDAEiQ)\n\nToday, because of its early stage of development and complex multi-chain architecture, both Polkadot and Kusama are changing rapidly and the user experience (UX) can be confusing for end users. It’s our goal to solve that using design, storytelling, and engineering. We abstract away the complexity of underlying implementation and provide a friendly user experience when using DotSama and a way to discover new applications and services available to end users, while keeping them safe and educated about the actions they are taking.\n\nThis proposal is for a business-friendly multisig frontend to lower the difficulty for teams and businesses when running their financial operations on Polkadot. Teams currently face many difficulties when trying to perform these operations, risking mistakes along the way, and leading them to choose convenience over security. We will apply Talisman’s UX and design philosophy to create improvements for standard workflows for Polkadot multisig usage (based on the current multisig pallet), and eventually integrate upgrades when improvements to the multisig pallet itself are available.\n\nWe have spoken to a number of stakeholders in the ecosystem and have strong validation for our proposed solution:\n- “Creating child bounties in pjs is time consuming and error prone, you have our full support” - Zoe Mechbach, VP, Phala Network\n- “We will definitely use it because we need it!” - Shun P, Head of Ops and Finance, Astar\n- “We would use it for sure” - Dennis & Alexandra, CTO & Marketing Director, Bitgreen\n- “If there was a multisig with better UX that allowed us to craft and verify multisig transactions faster we'd use it” Bruno, Founder, RMRK\n- “If you can improve the UX to make it easier for non-technical users to initiate and safely sign transactions, we will switch” - Daniel, Founder, Tapio\n\nThe full proposal is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KohKDEYypNw_KJING2_uHXnC0LJwUxpPHMzBRfrH68M/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThis submission follows from the following forum discussion: \nhttps://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1569",

      "content": "Dear Polkadot community,\n\nWe are TeachMeDeFi, a German language hub for web3 education, founded in 2022. Our mission is to deliver high-quality educational resources and foster a thriving community of web3 users, with a focus on simplifying and promoting decentralized technologies through our content and partnerships. We have already made significant strides in this mission and our portfolio thus far includes podcasts, interviews, educational videos, a community hub and a structured website.\n\nWe understand that bringing more awareness to Polkadot and doing more professional, targeted marketing has been a topic of discussion in the community and many have requested it as it has been somewhat lacking, even though the technological progress of Polkadot has been impressive. Furthermore, it has been a topic of discussion that diving into the Polkadot ecosystem can be complicated for new users.\n\nThis is why we are submitting a funding proposal to support the creation and promotion of content in order to increase awareness of the Polkadot ecosystem, reach a wider audience and significantly simplify the onboarding journey for new users.\n\nWe have already received support from key players in the Polkadot community and are excited to share our proposal.\n\nYou can read the full proposal document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10RNESvTjTVY1KUMkb1q6vJ5yrw5O-oZ8J2itQfJnRuQ/edit?usp=sharing) (live google doc) or [here](https://crustipfs.art/ipfs/QmRLHMXg3EFCS7J2MjmaDpnqLtt1SFPsgWF9unqR44vS2z) (ipfs pdf doc).\n\nIn this document, we describe in detail (1) the challenge Polkadot is facing, (2) the unique opportunity that the German language market represents and (3) the solution we propose which consists of several deliverables and a targeted marketing strategy.\n\nYou can find the original discussion post with feedback from the community [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1560).\n\nThank you for your consideration,\n\nThe TeachMeDeFi Team",

The results of the analysis was posted (see last post) for public scrutiny for which none was received. With this said, we would like to proceed with rewarding 22 pools with 250 DOT as well as issuing a payout to PolkaGate of 250 DOT as well for developing the tool.

We released the **SubWallet extension version** on all popular browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Edge) in February 2022 and keep releasing our product updates on a [bi-weekly basis](https://github.com/Koniverse/SubWallet-Extension/releases).\n\n**While using the browser extension, our community constantly asked about a more convenient mobile app**, which can provide them with a homogenous wallet experience in the whole Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem, and we listened. At the moment, there hasn’t been a native wallet on the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem that offers this **comprehensive and consistent multi-platform experience from Extension through to Mobile** to users. That is why we decided to start building the SubWallet Mobile App in June 2022.\n\n**This is SubWallet Mobile App's 1st proposal for Milestone 1 - 20 Weeks: From July 2022 to October 2022 (which is completed):**\n\n\n- Full proposal for Milestone 1 with a detailed description, costs, tractions, and future plans: [Link ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16phPsThpob4cQqvqsNIv-jVN1IWbrklS-LF6--pqm7Y/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)\n- More details and progress: [Link](https://github.com/Koniverse/SubWallet-Mobile/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)\n- Community Dicussion: [Link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1493)\n \n**Complete set of the proposal: ([See proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16phPsThpob4cQqvqsNIv-jVN1IWbrklS-LF6--pqm7Y/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1))** </br>\n\n- Mobile App Architecture Design\n- React Native Core Module (Android & iOS)\n- Basic React Native Element (Android & iOS)\n- Basic Features: Account Management, Send & Receive Assets, XCM Transfer,...

      "content": "**Proponent:** 12mRyiCp9zdh1wEVW5gLLiFBxDPKks72rRXmSupyEK3VAMLf\n\n**Date:**  25th January 2023\n\n**Requested DOT:**  10,859.582767 (USD $67,459.73)\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Polkadot, Statemint, Westend, and Encointer.\n\n**Raw Data:** [Polkadot Data Q4 2022](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z5ayTVPj_cbw9ewQPUQIsE3EmM9fHAadVKJgWoVwuPo/edit#gid=1173353638)\n\n**Full Report is here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBjcxgdhu6NnfhtrprJcnqvr-KM8H2Twq45rgJ9mDkM/edit?usp=sharing](url)\n\n* * * * *\n\nOriginal Motivation\n===================\n\nOver the last 3 months (October, November, December 2022) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Polkadot, Statemint, Westend, and Encointer nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we've made GitHub issues based on behaviour we've observed)\n\nService Details\n===============\n\nDuring Q4 of 2022, we've made a large number of stability improvements to our Ultimate API service. We've finished significant work on advanced rate limiting on behalf of our customers. This means that we can continue to provide generous public API endpoints for over 40 different networks for common-good applications, but restrict access to high volume users that abuse this free service. We've been able to manage our costs significantly on behalf of our customers as a result.\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we've been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. API access restrictions allow our customers to restrict their API keys to work only from 'Allowed' origins and/or IP addresses, preventing unauthorised consumption of their service. We also provide more detailed monitoring of failed requests through our service to help customers identify and fix bugs before they get to production.\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they've all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Polkadot chains.\n\nBetween 2022-10-01 and 2022-12-31 our Polkadot API service has:\n\n-   **Reduced cost to the Polkadot treasury by almost 50% from Q3** (Q4 was a slower period however our continued infra optimisations have had a significant impact on costs)\n\n-   Served a total of 6.7 billion responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 79.6 TB of data egress \n\n-   The highest daily total was 126 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Polkadot only\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 73.5 million responses each day.\n\n-   Westend had over 175 million API responses in the period\n\n-   Statemint had over 160 million API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Polkadot is 93,192,546,788 (93 Billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend was 99.86%, 99.99%, and 100%\n\n**Note that we have added support for the Encointer common good parachain for the first time in this proposal.** We have supported Encointer since the 9th of February 2022 but as a contribution to the ecosystem, we've been proud to provide over 7 months of free support at our own cost. From subsequent quarters, we expect to support more common good chains and include them in these proposals.\n\nEnhancements\n===============\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [API Access Restrictions ](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-rolls-out-three-new-features-on-its-enhanced-api-service/)--- a new security feature to help you securely manage access to your OnFinality API endpoints\n\n-   [Detailed Error type breakdowns](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-rolls-out-three-new-features-on-its-enhanced-api-service/) on your API Insights dashboard\n\n-   A new [Integration tab](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-rolls-out-three-new-features-on-its-enhanced-api-service/) to help you get connected quickly\n\n-   Support for more Polkadot parachains\n\n-   [New enhanced deployment automation processes](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-delivers-new-network-automation-tools-for-web3-developers-to-build-smarter/) to allow our network partners to automate deployment of their networks with OnFinality\n\n-   Support for [Ethereum](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-highly-scalable-rpc-api-helps-ethereum-scale-faster-than-ever/)\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/) and [network analytics page](https://onfinality.io/networks).\n\n\nFull Report is here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BBjcxgdhu6NnfhtrprJcnqvr-KM8H2Twq45rgJ9mDkM/edit?usp=sharing](url)",

      "title": "Snowbridge Funding Proposal",
      "content": "- **Treasury Proposal:** Snowbridge Funding Proposal\n- **Beneficiary:** 12UDxESUsqUZi5R5MpovTZLpAWZXPVWHJQkEprcT6MVdKh3A\n- **Amount:** USD 2,448,000.00 based on EMA7 rate by Subscan\n- **Scope:** See the [full funding proposal](https://spinamp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmehcCU8LjXRpj962YZYVJfHzwecvvdxbRH9BMEmiumcb9) for more details\n\n# Overview\nSnowbridge is a fully trustless, permissionless and general purpose bridge between Polkadot networks and Ethereum. The proposal covers a request for a 28 months worth of runway for all operations for the Snowbridge team, with the goal to launch as a common-good bridge on Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nOur bridge will launch on the Bridge Hub, a common-good parachain that is being developed by Parity for Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nThe proposal includes a motivation for supporting and promoting Snowbridge, a long term roadmap, governance and economic plans as well as incentives for successful execution, launch and long term running of the project.\n\n# Changes\nThe original Polkassembly post was created 4 weeks ago with extensive community discussion around the project here: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1341](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1341)\n\nThis final proposal is the same as in the above post, though a few small changes have been made:\n\n- Added more details about the bridge hub, with XCMv3 and Statemint XCM as an extra milestone of work on our roadmap\n- Add 1 month to the launch date to account for the extra work needed for XCMv3 changes for to bridge hub\n- We've extended the runway to 28 months instead of 24 month, but we're keeping the price the same and will cover the additional months with a small reduction in costs\n\n# History\nSnowfork is one of the longest running teams contributing to the Polkadot ecosystem. For over 2 years we've been working on Snowbridge, a fully trustless and permissionless bridge to Ethereum. We successfully built and completed an initial version of this bridge in September 2021, based on an Ethereum Proof of Work light client and on Parity's original BEEFY proof system funded by an initial grant from the Web3 Foundation.\n\n# Purpose\nPolkadot already has a few live Ethereum bridges across various parachains, but these all compromise on Polkadot's security and trust model. Some are secured by trusted multi-sigs, some are secured by alternative insurance collateral, but none are secured by Polkadot and none of the Ethereum or ERC20 assets that exist in the Polkadot ecosystem today are secured by Polkadot's security and trust model.\n\nWe believe that without a fully trustless bridge that is secured by Polkadot itself, the security of the wider Polkadot ecosystem is put at risk and that Snowbridge's trustless design is essential to a healthy ecosystem that can support Ethereum-based assets. Similarly, trustless support for Polkadot assets across the Ethereum ecosystem will be a valuable boon for us all.\n\nSnowbridge is also general-purpose, supporting arbitrary message passing and cross-chain smart contract calls, so any kinds of applications can be developed on top of it beyond plain asset transfer.\n\nAdditionally, as a common good service, longer term Snowbridge will be able to provide new value for the DOT token itself and generate an additional source of income for the treasury, or an additional lockup/burn mechanism for reducing the DOT supply.\n\n## Funding Request\nThis proposal is a funding request for 28 months worth of long term runway for all operations for the Snowbridge team *(16 months retroactive, 12 months in future)*, with the goal to launch as a common-good bridge on the Bridge hub on both Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nThe full proposal has been uploaded to IPFS separately, and includes extensive additional details related to further motivation for supporting and promoting Snowbridge, a long term roadmap, governance and economic plans as well as long term economic incentives for successful execution, launch and running of the project.\n\nWe request that anyone looking to meaningfully contribute to this discussion also reads through this full proposal.\n\nThis initial funding requests will be created alongside a secondary request on Kusama:\n\n- **Requested USD on Polkadot:** USD 2,448,000.00 based on EMA7 rate by Subscan.\n- **Requested USD on Kusama:** USD 612,000.00 based on EMA7 rate by Subscan.\n\nThere is an additional request for around USD 10,000,000.00 of long term economic incentives tied to key success milestones on the bridge, tied to measurable impact on the Polkadot ecosystem, although this payment will not be part of this first requested allocation.\n\nWe're planning to push out this proposal in the next month, and so are looking for early feedback and discussion from the community before going live with the proposal.\n\n## Roadmap\n1. Support XCMv3\n2. Mint wrapped assets on Statemint\n3. Governance and upgradability\n4. Dynamic circuit breaker on withdrawals \n5. Security Audits\n6. Deploy on Kusama (April 2023)\n7. Deploy on Polkadot (July 2023)\n\nSee the [full funding proposal](https://spinamp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmehcCU8LjXRpj962YZYVJfHzwecvvdxbRH9BMEmiumcb9) for more details.",

We’ve used that to significantly scale our research, data science, and engineering resources to build out our quarterly reporting and research capabilities. This has enabled us to bring all of our research in-house so we can have dedicated sector-specific analysts assigned to each protocol to cover them each quarter and continue to build up expertise.\n\nWe have also been working extensively on growing the distribution of these reports to further their reach and have signed deals with Bloomberg, S&P Global, and Refinitiv three of the largest traditional research platforms which are now distributing our quarterly reports.\n\nWe are proposing a continuation of the ecosystem-wide report along with quarterly reports while adding a governance deep dive. The total will be $190k payable in DOT with the same 10% premium to account for market volatility.\n\nYou can find more details in the [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14eA2ZQhxru51xY2KeOtzN31Z9cT7blas_4sXWCNKfew/edit#) as well as the [forum discussion](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1521).

It can be embedded within a web page, and thus allow end users to connect directly to the Polkadot network. Smoldot is a critical component in order to properly fulfill the goal of building a decentralized blockchain.\n\nI am now seeking financing for the maintenance and development of smoldot through treasury proposals. This post is here to gather your feedback on the proposal before submission on chain.\n\nYou can find all the details of the proposal here:\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MXkfPbxorqUgvKbZfD31HhHcpuXDMRYbIYGjpbCOuA/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13MXkfPbxorqUgvKbZfD31HhHcpuXDMRYbIYGjpbCOuA/edit)\n\nThank you for reading\n\nTomaka",

      "content": "\nHello everyone\n\nI am [Jörg Oechssler](https://www.awi.uni-heidelberg.de/professuren/with2/joerg_oechssler.html), Professor at the University of Heidelberg (Germany) and I conduct experimental economic research as part of my job. I am generally interested in auction theory and have been approached by W3F researchers some time ago to investigate the exotic candle auction format that is employed by Polkadot to allocate parachain slots. Not much has been done in academia so far to measure this novel approach and how well the mechanism performs. We spent some time preparing a rigorous design to mimic the environment that the auctions take place, while keeping mechanisms and influences controllable.\n\nOur method of choice is to analyze the auction in a laboratory experiment with students from the university. It is common practice in the field of experimental economics to test theories/models with students and pay them to participate.\n\nWith this proposal, I request **5720 EUR** (DOT rate to be calculated based on 7 day EMA rate: https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)) to pay those participants. **100% of the funds requested are to pay the students** (and to cover some exchange fees). Neither I, nor my team members receive any compensation from this proposal. All remaining funds will be send back to Treasury after the study ends. We are ready to start the experiment as soon as funds arrive. The experimental software is already programmed and we ran a pilot successfully.\n\nThe goal of this study is to publish it in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nPlease find much more details on the background, design, and budget --> [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMbE0TvXfU-f9ZVncXbXeF05my5pfn-NR9lSg9ZLL5s/edit?usp=sharing) <--\n\nTeam Members:\n\n* Jörg Oechssler (University of Heidelberg) - Beneficiary of the Proposal\n* Jonas Gehrlein (Web3 Foundation)\n* Samuel Haefner (University of St.Gallen, formerly Web3 Foundation)\n* Florian Franzen (Web3 Foundation) \n\n- FT rate EUR to USD: EUR 5,720 = USD 6179,80\n- 7 day EMA rate for DOT: 5.60 USD\n- Total allocation requested: 1103.57 DOT",

This is just generally a good idea, exists for a while already and has been successfully tested on Versi, Rococo and Westend. It is also required for rolling out slashing as it helps reducing the risk of unjustified slashes.\n\nParachains need to support the `go_ahead_signal,` but that should be a non issue as this has been introduced over a year ago.\n\n - Call to be enacted: [HERE](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.dotters.network%2Fpolkadot#/extrinsics/decode/0x332901).\n\nPreimage is submitted.

The upgraded parachain runtime introduced a couple of new pallets, the pallet-parachain-staking among them. This new pallet was responsible to assign new validators to session pallet and by extension the aura pallet. After the runtime upgrade, when a new session was triggered, it set the new authorities to an empty set since the pallet-parachain-staking was not set with any initial values.\n\nWe have explored all other solutions and after discussion and advice from Parity devs have created this proposal. Our humble request to the TC is to fastrack this proposal, this is purely a technical rollback since our chain has no user transactions or funds yet. We would like to distribute token rewards as soon as possible. Similar parachain resetshave been fastracked by the TC in the past and we request that our proposal be fastracked aswell.\n\nProposal hash: `0xfc0c33d0c0ae08d940fddadb11e239710da69b8660eaae7f77ea102a331e4ebe`\n\nPreimage is submitted. \n\n",

It is a collection of modules that Acala team created to solve issues that we encountered, to produce features that we wish existed, at the same time making it not specific to our chain but generic, so we can share them with our fellow developers in the whole Polkadot/Kusama community and help in some way.\n\nFast forward to late 2022, ORML is widely used by many teams in the ecosystem, and is receiving contributions from different teams. Acala remains the biggest contributor in development and maintenance of ORML.\n\nThis proposal (link to doc [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGvDnc_fHgowSUXE83hhPGsDPBF7cHWMbA4a14k_AyM)) is seeking payment to cover development and maintenance of the widely used Open Runtime Module Library between Jan 2022 and Oct 2022.\n\nCommunity members, please kindly review the proposal and ask questions you may have, we are happy to address questions before moving onto next step. You are also welcome to share how ORML is useful for your project(s). :)",

This will have several effects: **please read below!**\n\nFirst, any outstanding multisig calls (ones where one signatory has signed, but not the threshold) will not be able to execute.

      "content": "Seven of Polkadot’s leading projects have joined forces to establish standards and ethics for open-source development. The Polkadot Alliance was founded by Acala, Astar, Interlay, Kilt, Moonbeam, Phala, and Subscan, seven of the top projects occupying Polkadot’s parachain slots. The on-chain collective aims to support development standards and expose bad actors within the ecosystems of Polkadot. \n\nThe Polkadot Alliance is a ranked, on-chain collective. The ranks consist of \"Fellow” and \"Ally\" and will be discussed in more detail later. Although there is nothing in the protocol preventing an individual to join, the members of the Alliance are expected to be companies, projects, other collectives, or even other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. a company working on a parachain, or the Kusama network itself).\n\n\n## Founding Members:\n\nAcala - `12Nc2RuRfmZwNog7jCFzDK2D56HUfy9bYRr9dcFkpJnUwqpn`\n\nAstar - `1j5YyEGdcPd9BxkzVNNjKkqdi5f7g3Dd7JMgaGUhsMrZ6dZ`\n\nInterlay - `15Vd1mF4Uf4hVdS3q72t4y9fXxDZHLkQcHe77yEU4UQ7Jp3J`\n\nKILT - `143S55QzbrUYHkFcX6upPD6aJtsmXygLZTYVovpAkjPCMfNi`\n\nMoonbeam - `15o341YKi3FDX3fM1onp1bfLbjGcc13YNEFV6yQvSiCQaehi`\n\nPhala - `5D4ce5CWZwPrZzTptnHPYHmWEvc6sVBWEDgBnGvbwiGtuNQR`\n\nSubscan - `14RYaXRSqb9rPqMaAVp1UZW2czQ6dMNGMbvukwfifi6m8ZgZ`\n\n## Functions:\n\nThe Alliance performs three primary functions via its collective origin:\n\n1.

The Polkadot Alliance provides an on-chain framework to recognize those teams who empower others and contribute to the ecosystem in alignment with open source culture and call attention to those that do not.\n\n## Background\n\nAs the Polkadot ecosystem has expanded, some low-quality teams have started to pollute the Polkadot brand. These teams copy code without attribution, use \"Polka\" branding with no intention of building on Polkadot, conduct scammy token raises on Ethereum, launch rival relay chains, and are disrespectful in their interactions with other community members.\n\nWithout a time-consuming investigation into a team's website, code, and whitepaper, it can be extremely difficult for someone to distinguish between good and bad actors.\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance provides a set of ethics and standards for the community to follow. Alliance membership indicates that the Polkadot community recognizes the team's positive contributions such as code, infrastructure, community building and education.\n\nThe Alliance also provides on-chain means to call out bad actors. Members are expected to dedicate time from one team member to help investigate breaches of the Alliance's standards.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance is a ranked, on-chain collective. The ranks consist of \"Fellow” and \"Ally\" and will be discussed in more detail later. Although there is nothing in the protocol preventing an individual to join, the members of the Alliance are expected to be companies, projects, other collectives, or even other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. a company working on a parachain, or the Kusama network itself).\n\nThe Alliance performs three primary functions via its collective origin:\n\n1. Publication of a \"Rule\" which is this document;\n2. Management of its own membership, including promotion and removal;\n3. Curation of an \"Unscrupulous List\" containing URLs and accounts.\n\nThe Alliance can also make announcements from its collective origin, however it is expected that these pertain to its primary functions.\n\nNote that the Alliance does not have any on-chain governance power. Its collective origin can only manage its own state, but its domain does not reach into other parts of the Polkadot protocol.\n\nNote that the Alliance acts as a collective without intention to form a company or other formal association or cooperation. The aims of the Alliance are defined herein and nothing in this document, other documents or the work of the Alliance, Fellows or Allies shall be interpreted as investment advice.\n\n### Rule\n\nThe collective maintains an IPFS content ID to a \"Rule\", which is this document and can be thought of as a charter or mandate of the Alliance. It includes all the rules for operation of the Alliance, including guidelines for how it evaluates accounts and websites for inclusion in the Unscrupulous List, how an account or website could be removed from the list, how to join the Alliance, who has voting rights, what actions constitute grounds for removal, etc.\n\n### Unscrupulous List\n\nThe Alliance, through a 60% majority of voting members, can add or remove websites and accounts to the Unscrupulous List.\n\nWebsites in the list may include:\n\n1. Those known for scamming users.\n2. Projects that have violated the standards expected within the Polkadot community.\n3. Projects that have shown a disregard of open source licenses.\n4. Projects that have used the \"Polka-\", \"Dot-\", \"Para-\", etc. branding with no real intention to contribute to Polkadot.\n\nAccounts in the list may include those associated with known scams.\n\n#### Intended Use\n\nThe Unscrupulous List may sound familiar to those who know of the [Polkadot JS Phishing](https://github.com/polkadot-js/phishing) registry, and is indeed meant for similar use. As the Alliance has no on-chain governance power, it cannot stop any user from interacting or transacting with an address in the list. However, it may be useful for wallets to warn users if they are attempting to connect to a listed website or send funds to a listed account.\n\n## Operation\n\n### Polkadot Parachain\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance lives on-chain in a pallet on **the Collectives parachain**, `ParaId = 1001`. All websites, applications, wallets, etc. that display Alliance membership should pull their information from the on-chain collective as the source of truth for membership. All Alliance members will need to be able to transact on this parachain from their account that is in the Alliance.\n\n### Initialization\n\nInitialization of the Alliance happens from the root origin on the Polkadot Relay Chain. Once the founding members are set, it will be up to them to use their voting rights to manage membership of the collective, namely:\n\n1. Deciding to promote someone from Ally to Fellow;\n1. Nominating someone as an Ally;\n1. Removing members who have violated the standards of the group.\n\n### Disbanding\n\nThe Alliance should represent all Polkadot stakeholders, not just the founding set of members. If the Polkadot network loses confidence in the Alliance, it may disband the Alliance via general referendum, clearing all members and requiring re-initialization.\n\n## Ranks\n\nThere are two ranks in the Alliance, from highest to lowest:\n\n**Fellow**\n\n**Definition:** Fellows are members whose candidacy is endorsed by other Fellows. Fellows can also be an Ally that was promoted to Fellow.\n\n_Note: A portion of the Fellows will be Founding Fellows, which are the teams who built the Polkadot Alliance and started to contribute before it was live on-chain._ \n\n**Rights:** Fellows have voting rights on Alliance motions. Being a Fellow includes a strong commitment not just to abide by the standards, but also to enforce these standards in a consistent and timely manner. Fellows have voting rights and carry out the primary goals and on-chain operation of the Alliance. They should also be available to investigate and mediate in a dispute between two Allies.\n\n**Ally**\n\n**Definition:** Allies are members of the Polkadot Alliance who, through active and sustained contributions to the ecosystem, have the opportunity to be promoted to Fellow.\n\n**Rights:** Being an Ally (and not being kicked) is a powerful indication of alignment with the ethical standards set by the Alliance, but Allies do not have voting rights until they are promoted to Fellow.\n\n### Joining\n\nOnce the Alliance has been initialized via referendum, there are two ways to join as an Ally. The first is by submitting a transaction to join and placing a deposit of 1,000 DOT, which is locked until retirement from the collective.The second is by nomination by a Fellow, which does not require a deposit.\n### Promotion\n\nThe majority of Alliance members will remain Allies. Being an Ally (and not being removed by vote) indicates that the Fellows agree that the Ally is acting in accordance with the ethics set forth by the Alliance.\n\nHowever, some members may wish to take a more active role in operating the Alliance and be promoted to Fellow. This happens through a motion amongst the voting members and requires 60% approval to pass.\n\n#### Criteria for Promotion\n\nFor promotion to Fellow, a team must have a significant positive impact on the whole Polkadot ecosystem. This is judged based on positive impact to the ecosystem in, but not limited to, the following ways:\n\n* **Common good code contribution:** Common good code should be some open source code that's used by a significant number of live projects. Code that's for demo purposes would be excluded, as it doesn't have real impact yet.\n* **Standard development:** Common standard accepted by a significant number of live projects. There are many PSPs, but most of them are not actually used by multiple live projects so those will be excluded.\n* **Awareness & Education Efforts:** This could include various forms of long-term contributions through marketing, content, and education efforts for the benefit of the broader Polkadot ecosystem, not just a single chain or product.\n* **Useful products:** Building useful products that drive growth, adoption, user experience, or any significant improvement to Polkadot will be considered a strong positive impact. For example, a wallet or block explorer that supports multiple relay/parachains and has a big user base will be strongly considered to have a big impact on the ecosystem and eligible for promotion. A smart contract project that integrates with multiple parachains and builds a strong user base could also be considered. A protocol that only lives on a single chain with low adoption has a small impact and less chance for promotion to Fellow.\n\n### Retirement\n\nMembers who wish to leave the Alliance can do so by signaling their intent to leave with 90 days notice. This \"retirement period\" is similar to the unbonding period used in staking, and is in place to give voting members time to replace the member leaving, or take action like removing the member and slashing their deposit if they have violated the standards of the Alliance.\n\nThis period is long, but we expect members to have long-term commitment to the Polkadot network. Unlike staking, a resignation would be a one-time event. The 90 day notice period is more like a typical resignation notice with an employer.\n\n### Forceful Removal\n\nMembers can be removed from the Alliance by a motion among voting members that requires 60% approval. Members who are forcefully removed will have their deposit slashed and sent to the Polkadot Treasury.\n\n## Membership\n\n### Benefits\n\nThe Alliance is not only to call out bad actors; being in the Alliance requires an investment of time and a high standard of behaviour. Members of the Alliance deserve recognition in the ecosystem, in applications, and in their own branding and marketing.\n\nThe Alliance has a number of [brand assets] (https://github.com/patractlabs/alliance-website/tree/master/packages/app/src/assets/imgs) available for use for its members.\n\n### Member Expectations\n\nFellows and Allies alike must show the Polkadot Alliance badge on their project website,  proof-of-membership or QR code (similar to Star Alliance, the airline alliance) to allow easy verification.\n\nVoting members (Fellows) must commit to evaluate claims of scams or misbehaviour and vote on motions in a timely manner.\n\nAll members commit to timely integration of the on-chain information with any of their systems where it would be relevant to display that information, as well as general off-chain best practices. This should include:\n\n* Displaying correct identicons for addresses\n* Utilizing the finality system (as opposed to arbitrary \"confirmation depth\")\n* Displaying short-form index SS58 or accounts’ names where possible\n* Displaying identity attestation information\n* Displaying Polkadot Alliance status of addresses\n* Displaying status of addresses and websites that have been deemed unscrupulous.\n\nThe Alliance should uphold the following rules of membership, and apply them to all the teams, addresses, and websites that they evaluate:\n\n#### Minimum Contribution Requirements & Relegation\n\nSee “Criteria for Promotion” above for general guidance on how a strong contribution to the Polkadot ecosystem is defined. For Fellows to remain in their position, the project must meet these criteria at least every month, or could be subject to relegation to Ally.\n\n#### Respect for Others\n\n1. A warm and welcoming community is key to attracting new members and maintaining existing ones, which helps build up expertise and talent. Open and rational criticism is key to the enlightened evolution of ideas and must be welcomed. However, it must always be taken into account that the Polkadot community is comprised of diverse cultures, experiences and perspectives, so interaction must at all times be based on mutual respect, decency and consideration. Members and representatives of Alliance teams shall respect the Polkadot Community Principles at all times. Repeated infractions may result in the suspension of the team. Teams/projects should encourage their own community members to follow the Polkadot Code of Conduct and manage members of their community who are in violation.\n\n#### Respect of Intellectual Property\n\n1. **Open-Source technology builds a brilliant network.** Technical communities grow and success happens through network effects. Successful members attract users to their platform and to underlying platforms in order to drive growth for other members. Network effects happen on many levels, but often center around the need for shared formats, protocols, interfaces, and their underlying code. Open source and open engineering in general help drive these network effects, and in the case of Alliance members, help Polkadot become a successful platform. Alliance members commit to ensure all code, formats, and protocols used are made open to the maximum degree possible given their business constraints. Alliance members are not required to open all of their technology, but are expected to take a pragmatic approach when deciding to do so. Egregious, persistent, and unreasonable refusal to open parts of technology when to do so could not reasonably be expected to affect the team’s value proposition, but does clearly harm the overall Polkadot technical community may result in a warning and, if unchecked, suspension from the Alliance.\n\n2. **Unattributed code reuse threatens code creativity.** Respectful attribution is a cornerstone of a strong technical open source community. A credible expectation that attribution will be given provides an incentive for open-engineering and the sharing of technical labor. Communities suffer and break when work is misattributed. The Polkadot technical community is no different: open source licenses must be respected at all times and minor infractions of this (what could reasonably be considered to be accidental) should be dealt with a warning to the team. Larger infractions (e.g. where code was copied in bulk and the license was clearly stated and ignored), repeated minor infractions, or a refusal to correct an infraction may result in suspension from the Alliance.\n\n3. **Branding builds a strong community.** The ability to create and advertise a product under a clear brand is a cornerstone of modern communication. Brands reduce confusion within an ecosystem and beyond by creating clear, meaningful labels to distinguish between teams and products. Trademarks help facilitate this by providing a level of formal legal protection but they are difficult, time-consuming, and costly to enforce. Disrespect of branding and trademarks within the ecosystem leads to confusion of the ecosystem’s user base, resulting in a weaker platform. The trademarks of Alliance teams shall be respected at all times and a clear, unauthorized breach shall result in suspension from the Alliance. The unauthorized use of team or product branding which could reasonably be considered to be derivative from another Alliance team shall firstly be warned and, if unchecked in a timely and reasonable manner, secondly result in a suspension from the Alliance.\n\n#### Respect of the Polkadot Brand\n\n1. **The community has unity around the Relay Chain.** Polkadot was not designed to be a lonely chain and the Alliance very much respects the prospect of a rich environment of many chains each going in their own technical direction in order to optimize for their own use case. So, where there are external networks that deliver key features, use cases, or user-access that Polkadot does not or cannot address, then Alliance members should be encouraged to work together with these networks, building bridges and collaborating in enlightened self-interest for mutual benefit. However, alternative Polkadot-like relay chains which provide essentially equivalent functionality to, or even aim to supplant the Polkadot mainnet provide distraction and fragmentation, and in the long-run could hurt Polkadot’s security, technology, and social integrity. Alternative relay chains deriving significantly or entirely from the Polkadot technology base, in terms of design, protocol, or code should be judged by the principle of the minimum number of relay chains, and prevented from becoming members of the Alliance. Alliance teams should not support or work with these networks. Exemptions are made should the Alliance determine that the network in question provides a greater overall value to Polkadot than the cost of network fragmentation. The complete list of exemptions has only one member — Kusama — as it provides a value-bearing testbed for Polkadot technology and clearly addresses a lower-security, lower-reliability usage proposition.\n\n2. **Polka-/Dot- branding only for Polkadot projects.** In the interests of minimizing confusion and retaining a coherent community brand, products branded to give the appearance of being Polkadot-based should be legitimately linked to the Polkadot technology base. Blockchain-based products whose names contain the “Parachain”, Polka\", or “Dot” word fragments, or which clearly derive their overall brand from the Polkadot style guide, must have a credible plan to become a parachain on Polkadot or an affiliate network. Teams who host an invalidly labeled product may not be Alliance members and Alliance members should not collaborate with teams who do host such products.\n\n3. **Commitment to scam prevention.** It is important for a community to take reasonable precautions to protect their members from serious abuses of trust. While there are some reasonably legitimate projects with weak or no safeguards on their contributions, the reality is that most of such projects promised much and delivered little. Large-scale pre-release crowdfunding on alternative platforms should be investigated by Alliance members and should be up for discussion if the project belongs to an Alliance member. Alliance members may take into account whatever factors they want when considering approval, including the team’s reasons for crowdfunding, the platform on which they are crowdfunding (Polkadot-based platform may be considered a more reasonable choice), the oversight and governance safeguards given to participants, and the team’s demonstrated ability to deliver on the promises they make. All in all, Alliance members should collaborate with any initiatives aiming to protect community members from scam activities.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Polkadot Alliance is a ranked, on-chain collective of teams with a track record of delivering valuable contributions to the network and who have a long-term alignment with developing a welcoming, innovative Polkadot network. The members set and uphold a set of ethics and standards for others to model in the ecosystem.

      "content": "This proposal aims to provide ecological users with an open-source toolset, which covers all processes of custom data dashboard and is suitable for mainstream front-end frameworks. Users can use it to conveniently generate, configure, and manage data widgets and inject them into any project that needs to display blockchain data.\n\nThe toolset contains three parts: **Editor**, **Parser**, and **Management Tools**. The editor is used to generate and configure data widgets. The parser is used to parse and display widgets. Management Tool is used for widgets management. They all follow the [License apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\nWe provide it with a wealth of widgets (covering more than 90% of the [Subscan explorer](https://www.subscan.io/) component library) and support commonly used data sources in the blockchain, such as HTTP API, GraphQL, State, LocalStorage, etc. Any developer (even users without a development background) can use it to customize blockchain data views easily. \n\n1) Using this toolset, users can easily create a user-friendly explorer UI with any open-source explorer solution (such as [Subscan Essentials](https://github.com/subscan-explorer/subscan-essentials)).\n\n2) Using this toolset, you can customize widgets with custom data sources, such as API / GraphQL([Subquery](https://subquery.network/)), that can be integrated into your websites, Dapps, or any other web views.\n\nIn the future, Subscan will develop and deploy free online services based on this toolset.  It will enable users to create and submit widgets to Subscan explorer. Our ideal goal is to create a Dune-like data visualization publishing and collaboration platform.\n\n**Total**\n\nThe total amount above is $201,600, and the amount of DOT will be converted based on the EMA7 price on the day of the official submission.\n\n2022-12-08 01:55:42 (+UTC), Block #13260191\n\nDOT EMA7 Price ( USD ): 5.421;\n\nNumber of DOT: 37,183.847\n\n> EMA 7 Price: https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=201600&type=time&from=USD&to=DOT&time=1670464800\n\n> The full proposal is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NWmpdpaz_uvmHdSI1_wneUetp_OcwwzhVEYxInqRc_A/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n> View previous discussion [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1441)\n\n",

      "title": "Hardware signer and key storage Kampela: Milestones 3&4",
      "content": "This is proposal for Milestones 3&4.\n\nDOT/EUR exchange rate calculated as 5.2334 by EMA7 (EMA with 168 period frame) by [Kraken](https://trade.kraken.com/snapshot/ce84vn6l6f69360p0elg-kraken-dot-eur\n)\n\nOur team proposes to design an open source hardware storage for dotsama ecosystem.\n\n[Please see complete proposal on Skiff](https://app.skiff.com/docs/6e1d3e9f-9e2c-4413-9190-9c39cda20763#yJcS2WZZbiuFk4Pe3W5nycQ7vcjEbrXkbfcf2EKIiV4=)\n\nProject name is Kampela, Finnish word for flounder fish. The device is envisioned as flat card mostly consisting of e-paper screen and few controls (and it allows keys to stay safely in depth).\n\nKampela is a hardware version of Parity Signer. It is a small card-shaped device (ideally comparable to a credit card form factor, to be carried in a wallet when needed) that accepts data through unidirectional NFC port and shows output on a monochrome electronic paper screen. It has cryptographic strongbox with elliptic curves supported by Substrate — which only stores private keys (after initial import) and performs all signing operations on-chip.\n\nKampela is designed to be a comparatively low-cost (below €100, in contrast to €500+ for a Signer-compatible smartphone) single-purpose device, which would only support a single seed phrase per unit, operated via a drastically simplified user interface. However, it would have all the security features of Parity Signer: a full-featured SURI account derivation system, transactions preview, metadata updates, logging.\n\nAs something that supports the same QR code output formats as Signer, it would be able to drop-in replace Signer when providing signatures back to a mobile/desktop wallet. The only challenge would be in transforming the current QR-driven input format of Signer into a suitable NFC payload. Alongside with native support in some apps (which would require software modification) this can also be achieved with a tiny “translator” app for a regular (online, not necessary trusted — one’s usual daily driver) mobile phone: it would snap a QR code with the transaction details and (statelessly, without any extra features or complicated UI) transform that into an NFC payload.\n\nKampela is a natural (and long-discussed) extension of Parity Signer to leverage the most out of modern hardware-based crypto chips and drastically reduce Signer’s attack surface: no mobile OS, not extra platform features, no unexpected communication methods or airplane mode to take care of.\n\nKampela is not a wallet! It is a signing tool, it is not able to track on-chain balances, validate things over chain-provided information or generate transactions on itself.\n\nThe scope of this proposal does not include actual production, but does result in all preliminary development required for production. Hopefully, many assembly shops would rush in to compete with us and each other!\n\n[Project repository](https://github.com/Alzymologist/Kampela) (check out PRs for more recent WIP)\n\nProject matrix room: #Kampela:matrix.zymologia.fi\n\n[This proposal was prevoiusly posted in Discussions](../post/1227)\n\n[Proposal for milestones 1&2](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/163)\n\n[Milestone 1 report](https://app.skiff.com/docs/2b25845a-4a00-4bf4-aaff-3de4a70d4ad7#zSepFgAI0EetUe7eIp2Tlgu/RnhMjnAJRDecVUiVmhQ=)\n\n[Milestone 2 report](https://app.skiff.com/docs/5dcbeadc-e5f3-4f29-8476-e8fcb7786585#ZNnc%2FdmSz3dYkUNc%2BI%2BiarGsZKa0W9uUN25ZqCySPAg%3D)\n\nEdit: [Milestone 3 report](https://app.skiff.com/docs/a0583eb2-1b44-46f1-b921-4dc4aa8abf68#QczSiY%2BGxi93PTv%2BFAd%2BPuNnfBqh%2BCpqBIFdooAufCo%3D)\n\nEdit: [Milestone 4 report](https://app.skiff.com/docs/984d9ed1-9271-4457-be04-a6eca0f25f39#JZdHE9gfXVn%2BtkTl7EBOqCsxCfo%2F2FRjO%2FnnOJoJM6I%3D)",

For most calls this isn't any problem as they should be fit easily into a block. However, for `set_code` the dev team currently has annotated it with using the max block weight: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 ](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 )\n\nSo, when trying to execute `set_code` with the scheduler it will always fail this check.

      "title": "[PLEASE REJECT] Runtime v9320 Upgrade On Polkadot",
      "content": "This proposal will fail in enactment, so [external motion 306](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/306) is now opened to cancel this. A change on FRAME code explained below is the reason this will fail: as the dev team works on transforming all FRAME pallets and code to work properly with WeightsV2, they have added the following check to the scheduler pallet: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs#L1105-L1107](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/scheduler/src/lib.rs#L1105-L1107)\n\nThis piece of code should ensure that we don't execute a scheduled call that would use more weight than we have left for the block. For most calls this isn't any problem as they should be fit easily into a block. However, for `set_code` the dev team currently has annotated it with using the max block weight: \n\n[https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 ](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/b1396f708b2001593d5589dd1bd3f832821fb208/frame/system/src/lib.rs#L404-L405 )\n\nSo, when trying to execute `set_code` with the scheduler it will always fail this check. There will be already some consumed weight when trying to dispatch the call and `some_weight + max_block_weight` will always be bigger than `max_block_weight`. A new proposal will be submitted with the correct call soon.\n\nPlease note this proposal should be rejected.\n\n______________________\n_______________________\n_______________________\n\nThe proposal aims to upgrade Polkadot’s runtime to [v9320](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.32): more information can be found on the release notes.\n\n\n**Runtime**\n\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12358](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12358) Low - Remove contracts rpcs\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12421](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12421) Low - Adapt `pallet-contracts` to weightv2\n- [S] ✅ audited [#11649](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11649) Low - Bound uses of `call`\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12429](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12429) Low - Contracts: adapt dry-run runtime apis to weightv2\n- [S] ⏳ pending non-critical audit [#12282](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12282) Low - Maximum value for `multiplierupdate`\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6021](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6021) Low - Maximum value for multiplierupdate\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12334](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12334) Low - Macro stubs for all pallet:: macros to improve documentation visibility and discovery + revamp of pallet macro documentation\n- [S] ✅ audited [#12109](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12109) Low - Vesting pallet - make `withdrawreasons` configurable\n- [P] ✅ audited [#5451](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/5451) Low - Manual para lock\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6155](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6155) Low - Add `force_open_hrmp_channel` call\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6171](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6171) Low - Bump transaction_version (0.9.31)\n- [S] ✅ trivial [#12558](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12558) Low - Update `pallet-multisig` benches\n- [P] ✅ trivial [#6189](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6189) Low - Update weights, attempt two (0.9.31)\n\nThis release also contains the changes **from v0.9.31 to v0.9.32**:\n- [Substrate#12630](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12630): Make `--database` cli argument case insensitive again.\n- [Substrate#12632:](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12632): Fixes a bug with the transaction pool after doing a warp sync.\n- [Substrate#12633](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12633): Fixes the `payment_queryInfo` RPC to be compatible with the latest runtime changes.\n\n\nProposal hash: `0xbd78d3542767047aba0babb8c8825a5799e3ef54a21193ffe24b98eb4f895162`\n\nYou can review the hash and changes in the release notes and use SRTool to verify proposal hash - make sure to vote at your convenience!

We launched our MVP in June 2021 and have been providing free RPC services to the Polkadot ecosystem’s participants since Q3 2021. Our mission is to aid the Polkadot protocol in achieving its vision of a multi-chain future by providing easy-to-use, reliable, and scalable infrastructure services which remove an entire layer of complexities for developers to start building on Polkadot/Substrate.\n\nEcosystem participants can access our free API service by creating their own API Key on [Pinknode Portal ](https://portal.pinknode.io/signup)or using our public endpoints (listed at https://polkadot.js.org/apps). In a bid to reduce barriers to entry and attract more developers to the ecosystem, our premium plan, which includes archive data and higher rate limits, is also free for all builders and participants of Polkadot to utilize. \n\n- https://public-rpc.pinknode.io/polkadot\n- wss://public-rpc.pinknode.io/polkadot\n- https://public-rpc.pinknode.io/statemint\n- wss://public-rpc.pinknode.io/statemint\n- https://public-rpc.pinknode.io/westend\n- wss://public-rpc.pinknode.io/westend\n\n**Service Details**\n\n**For Q1/22, from 1st January 2022 to 31st March 2022,**\n\nPinknode’s Polkadot RPC nodes have served an average of 2,737,933 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 246,413,975 requests for the quarter.\n\nPinknode’s Statemint RPC nodes have served an average of 159,873 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 14,388,568 requests for the quarter.\n\nPinknode’s Westend RPC nodes have served an average of 189,120 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 17,020,770 requests for the quarter.\n\n**For Q2/22, from 1st April 2022 to 30th June 2022,**\n\nPinknode’s Polkadot RPC nodes have served an average of 4,849,336 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 441,289,552 requests for the quarter.\n\nPinknode’s Statemint RPC nodes have served an average of 174,230 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 15,854,972requests for the quarter.\n\nPinknode’s Westend RPC nodes have served an average of 230,021 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 20,931,893 requests for the quarter.\n\n**For Q3/22, From 1 July 2022 to 30 September 2022,**\n\nPinknode’s Polkadot RPC nodes have served an average of 8,708,123 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 792,477,238 requests for the quarter.\n\nPinknode’s Statemint RPC nodes have served an average of 26,7682 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 24,359,125 requests for the quarter.\n\nPinknode’s Westend RPC nodes have served an average of 350,008 requests per day, for a cumulative total of 31,850,748 requests for the quarter.\n\n**Enhancements for the past 3 quarters:**\n\n- Configuration of our Kubernetes clusters and auto-scaling mechanism\n- Automated snapshot scripts\n- Setup health check and monitoring tools\n- Launch of Pinknode 1.0\n- Enhancement of Pinknode’s proxy service and routing protocol.\n- Testing and implementation of service recovery scripts\n- Introduction of Pinknode’s Status Page for better visibility\n- Automated chain upgrade scripts\n\nPinknode achieved service reliability of 99.94% for Q3 2022 with one major downtime incident on 12 Aug 2022. This major incident was traced to insufficient resource allocation for Pinknode’s proxy service and the fault was promptly resolved.

The bridge will launch on the Bridge Hub, a common-good parachain that is being developed by Parity for Kusama and Polkadot. This proposal is a funding request for 28 months worth of long term runway for all operations for the Snowbridge team (16 months retroactive, 12 months in future), with the goal to launch as a common-good bridge on the Bridge hub on both Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nThe full proposal can be reviewed on [the post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/192) and includes extensive additional details related to further motivation for supporting and promoting Snowbridge, a long term roadmap, governance and economic plans as well as long term economic incentives for successful execution, launch and running of the project. Please note that both networks are voting on the project: the Kusama proposal (up for vote by the community on OpenGov) can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/1). \n\nIf approved by Council, this proposal will be up for vote after by the community in referenda queue. @Councillors: please review and vote at your convenience!\n\nProposal hash: 0xcb7a0584b5d85d6065d2e492d476aa1c1b92b9a0e492aa668b33036671500ddb",

This creates a nomination market, where in every era, the top 22\\_500 nominators from this open market are chosen to participate in the election process, and possibly receive staking rewards (if other conditions like over-subscription are not met).\n\nThis is a complicated and involved process. Nomination pools are exactly here to combat this and provide a simpler experience for DOT-holders to participate in staking.\n\nBased on this, let’s cluster Polkadot nominators into two groups: **active** (in the top 22500), and **waiting**. The main concern at this point is to\n\n-   Encourage all existing waiting nominators to join pools. This is mainly a task for the Wallet/UI development ecosystem, and is beyond the scope of this discussion.\n-   Prevent too many waiting nominators to be created. The reason being that I speculate that most of these nominators have **erroneously** in the waiting queue, and prefer joining pools instead.\n\nTo achieve the second goal, we can set the nomination limits (10 DOTs, 50\\_000) such that the system is not so _inviting_ to waiting nominators. In other words, the system should try and prevent nominators from being created, if they are certainly going to end up being in the waiting queue.\n\nFor example, we empirically know that the actual amount of DOTs needed to be an active nominator is around 200 DOTs as of this writing. Therefore, we can set the minimum nomination limit to a higher value such as 100.\n\nNote that keeping a buffer of waiting nominators is a positive factor for Polkadot's economic security. It allows for buffer of waiting nominators to be ready, should a (malicious) cluster of nominators decide to chill all at once, preventing nothing at stake issues. Therefore, I am not suggesting lowering 50\\_000 as well, and find that a reasonable bound. But, with nomination pools, I do think we should immediately forward anyone with less than e.g. 50 DOTs to join pools instead, and the way to do that is to immediately reject their nominate transaction.\n\n-   [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1224](../post/1224)",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy name is Chris Veselinov, CTO of LimeChain, and I’m writing this thread to propose the development (and funding) of a Go Runtime.\n\nWith this proposal, we’re looking to diversify and simplify the blockchain (parachain) development process, making the ecosystem more approachable/beginner-friendly and potentially more stable.\n\n**The ultimate/end goal is creating a framework in Go, which is an alternative to Substrate.** However, it will be technically challenging to go for the direct implementation without abstracting components into different modules. Given that a modular approach has been taken, the practical goal would be to formalize those modules into a framework that can be reused by other developers.\n\n**This is why we propose to develop a framework for building Go Runtimes.**\n\nWe recently got a [W3F grant to research the technical feasibility of the project](https://github.com/LimeChain/Open-Grants-Program/blob/application/research-feasibility-go-runtime/applications/research-feasibility-go-runtime.md), as we encountered some Go-related challenges along the R&D process. We were able to get those out of the way and you [can look at our efforts here](https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble).\n\n**Please see the [official proposal document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i8DnmVdgJz8jxHOUxO3LM6MlX4QhGP2fE33vmQI2Vgk/edit?usp=sharing). Any feedback or comments are highly appreciated.**\n\nAbout us: [LimeChain](https://limechain.tech/) is a blockchain development company founded in 2017 with a focus on building core blockchain infrastructure, developer tooling and dapps. We dove into the Polkadot ecosystem about 2 years ago with [Subsembly](https://github.com/LimeChain/subsembly)  - a framework used to design and implement Substrate runtimes in AssemblyScript, again funded by the W3F. Due to AssemblyScript limitations, we were able to partially deliver on the framework specifications.\n\nThanks on behalf of the whole LimeChain team!",

Therefore, I have opened this as a motion requiring approval from 7 of 13 councillors. If discussion shows that people think that this is controversial, then we can reject the motion and make it a referendum.\n\nI also recommend leaving this open for a few days to make sure that node operators can set up their Statemint nodes.",

      "content": "**Proponent:** 12wWLUd5qMzLFGqBsMnHLVFeTuYJwuo5ygMAxuSywrBX1XSF\n\n**Date:** 07.11.2022\n\n**Requested DOT:** ($172,500) ~27,080 DOT\n\n**Contact:** Frederik Gartenmeister (frederik@centrifuge.io)\n\n***\nThis is a Polkadot treasury proposal by **Centrifuge** to fund the development of FUDGE (FUlly Decoupled Generic Environment for substrate-based chains). FUDGE provides a simple and generic way to interact with and manipulate the database of a substrate-based blockchain. This includes building and importing blocks locally without any kind of network or consensus, as also changing existing state and finalizing it without the need of forging a new block.\n\nThe currently most obvious use-case for FUDGE are local integration tests as the library drastically reduces time and overhead for these. But the library is furthermore useful as a core building block around clis in the Substrate ecosystem. E.g. a cli for forking-off a database of a node, tooling around analysing a chain in various states (i.e. at variaous blocks).\n\nThere already exists a PoC version of the library ([https://github.com/centrifuge/fudge](https://github.com/centrifuge/fudge)) and the library is actively used by the Centrifuge team for integration tests ([https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/tree/main/runtime/integration-tests](https://github.com/centrifuge/centrifuge-chain/tree/main/runtime/integration-tests)).\n\nThe full proposal can be found here: [https://centrifuge.hackmd.io/@rxJQ-iCrT9eYElX4L2WMmA/BkMfLwPli](https://centrifuge.hackmd.io/@rxJQ-iCrT9eYElX4L2WMmA/BkMfLwPli)",

      "content": "The proposal aims to seek support from the Polkadot Treasury for the 2022/9-2023/2 operating cost for the Chinese non-profit organization Polkadot Ecology Research Institute, in order to create more original and quality Chinese content, and to relay the otherwise boring technical language to Chinese users in a colloquial way, so that Chinese users can have a real knowledge of Polkadot and increase the breadth of Polkadot in the Chinese market. On the other hand, we will also follow up on the outstanding projects of the Polkadot ecology to keep everyone informed of the latest developments of the Polkadot ecology.\n\nPolkadot's success cannot be separated from the prosperity of the Polkadot Ecological Projects. Our goal is to make more people aware of Polkadot and also to make more people aware of the development of Polkadot ecology, which in turn will lead them to join in the participation and construction of Polkadot ecology, so that Polkadot and Polkadot ecology can flourish.\n\nSince March 2022, [we have established a Polkadot Treasury for our 2022/3-2022/8 operation cost, and get funding from the Polkadot Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTWu_x7ULOKLz5Vmk2BMNj_THXFyXkDbKbpQRvKnBCw/edit?usp=sharing). Here is our [report for the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NSbOcxFL3d7FwrGhA8JAmO83OZdtIg-Z4x9_Db7Vuw/edit?usp=sharing). Please check our report to learn more.\n\nSo this is a proposal for our six months operation cost. We apply approx 104,760.00 USD total allocation for 2022/9-2023/2 and [you can get all details here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-b_DQXHVyRuAoYubCtL9dk0R6a_ev7xbwYMV518ONpo/edit?usp=sharing).",

Working together with leading web3 ecosystems, we introduce developers to new technologies and help them launch their projects and careers. Our online and free education platform already has 109,000+ developers from Turkey learning on the platform.\n\nWe propose to onboard these devs to the Polkadot ecosystem with the following steps:\n\n- Learning pathway for Turkish developers: We will create a free, online, beginner-friendly and well-structured “Polkadot Rust&Substrate Practicum'' learning pathway.\n- Polkadot Rust&Substrate Practicum and community events: Practicum is Patika.dev’s scalable cohort-based training model where participants complete the learning pathway together, supporting each other in their cohorts and during office hours with teaching assistants.\n\nThe aim of the project is to onboard 2000 devs to Polkadot ecosystem and get at least 100 project submissions at the end of the practicum. Please find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmoam1qMuat8N8KEeJ5jAeMpVshjQ6NVqOUkFDLOXzM/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we've made GitHub issues based on behaviour we've observed)\n\n## Service Details\n\nDuring the last quarter, we've focused on three key areas for the development of OnFinality - cost optimization, network expansion, and providing more value from our Ultimate API service.\n\nThe bear market has made many of our customers more price sensitive, and as such we've been working with them to optimise our services to provide more for less. We've reduced prices for our larger customers between 30 and 40%, and created products designed to target and onboard new chains with entry level pricing. We've also been working on new rate limiting capabilities to progressively restrict abusers of our public APIs to upgrade to paid API plans.\n\nIn the past quarter we have succeeded in our goal of onboarding two new networks, with the addition of Avalanche and Juno to our API service. This was a large amount of upfront work, extending OnFinality to allow chains outside of Polkadot/Substrate, but now that it has been done we should be able to move faster and onboard new chains each week. We hope that this means that we will be able to invite as many new ecosystem participants into Polkadot as possible with this expansion. \n\nFinally, providing move value from our Ultimate API service has always been a priority, and in this space we've added new API specific paid plans at competitive prices to our competition. We have also delivered the ability for our customers to better understand and learn about their users, with API Insights that tell you where your users are, what they are requesting, what methods are failing (to find bugs in your dApp), and where optimisations can occur.\n\nWe continued to execute on our efforts to provide unprecedented service stability and reliability to this ecosystem. All supported networks exceeded our 99.9% target, including 99.94% uptime for Polkadot over the last 90 days . At this stage, OnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% availability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.\n\nBetween 2022-07-01 and 2022-09-30 our Polkadot API service has:\n-   **Served almost 100% more traffic with only a 10% increase in cost**\n-   Served a total of 21.4 billion responses\n-   Accumulated over 100 TB of data egress \n-   The highest daily total was 517 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Polkadot only\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 157 million responses each day.\n-   Westend had almost 167 million API responses in the period\n-   Statemint had over 172 million API responses in the period\n-   All time totals for Polkadot is 86,820,238,239 (86 Billion) since November, 2020\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend was 99.94%, 99.99%, and 99.67%\n\n## Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter.

      "title": "Sequester Common Good Chain - Milestone 1",
      "content": "Hi all!\n\nSequester is a toolkit that will allow any chain in the Polkadot ecosystem to easily use their transaction fees to buy carbon-backed assets and retire associated carbon credits in less than 1 day of development time.\n\nSince Polkadot-based chains are fee-optional, transaction fees currently being used as an anti-spam mechanism can be leveraged to make every transaction on Polkadot carbon negative, without requiring any changes to the user experience. We propose a common good parathread on Polkadot, named Sequester, that provides the functionality of aggregating transaction fees, exchanging them into carbon-backed tokens, and retiring underlying carbon offsets that meet the community’s specifications.\n\nThe Bitgreen team will be our initial ecosystem partner and will be responsible for bridging Carbon Credits on-chain in a sustainable manner. As Sequester is Common Good functionality, it is important to note that it will be fully un-opinionated about where funds donated through the Sequester chain go. Specifically, once additional ESG tokens are onboarded to Sequester, teams will be able to configure the allocation of their funds with a single XCM to the Sequester Common Good chain.\n\nWe completed our first W3F grant earlier this summer and have joined the Substrate Builders Program. The development in this grant will fund our 1st SBP Milestone. For more context on our work, check out our White Paper and Polkadot Decoded Announcement with Bitgreen.\n\nThis grant will fund the creation of a common good chain that receives tokens from other chains' treasuries, swaps them via a DEX into carbon backed assets, and retires the underlying assets on chain. This will be tested on Rococo, with our partners from W3F, Acala, and Bitgreen.\n\nPlease see our [Treasury Proposal Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hfmXwe6Gli92YKr5J6BCffGWU9EmKUF-FkSbLs2w-OQ/edit#) for details.\n\nOther Information:\n\nPrice Calculation: 100,000 / 6.166 (7-day EMA) = 16,218\n\n[Discussion Post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1279)\n\n[AMA w/ Bill Laboon](https://twitter.com/BillLaboon/status/1578354625207758850)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-aGKz0I9zY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-aGKz0I9zY)\n\nThanks, The Sequester Team (Brendan, Ethan, and Daniel)",

      "title": "Polkadot Collectives Common Good Parachain Proposal",
      "content": "As outlined in a [recent blog post](https://polkadot.network/blog/proposal-for-common-good-parachains/), this discussion is about a proposal to add a new common good parachain to Polkadot focused on collectives. The first collective to form will likely be the [Polkadot Alliance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aXlVDDQj6v8kOTvbMXBmenBZ3Sfn5zZf0ipQbYvdipo/edit#), but this parachain will also support other collectives that are in service of the Polkadot network.\n\nThere are no plans for a Kusama counterpart to the Polkadot Collectives parachain. In fact, the Kusama network itself may join several collectives to exercise its voice within the Polkadot ecosystem. For example, the Kusama network could join the Polkadot Alliance to set the standards for Polkadot brand use.\n\nOther collectives do not warrant two distinct groups, like the [Technical Fellowship](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/calling-polkadot-core-developers/506). This group of technical experts who have made core protocol contributions to the network, would have nearly identical member sets, as the developers most intimatly familiar with Polkadot's inner workings deploy most of their code on Kusama as a step toward Polkadot.\n\nI intend to submit this proposal to the Council to register and onboard the Collectives parachain with a four-year lease, and posting here first to open discussion.\n\nThe full launch will include a series of referenda on Polkadot for approval by the entire stakeholder body. These will be roughly as follows:\n\n1. This proposal, to register the parachain and set the lease period. Once on board, it should start producing blocks. However, since it is not a trusted teleporter from the Relay Chain's point of view, nobody will be able to transact on it as there won't be any DOT with which to pay fees.\n1. Runtime upgrade to the Relay Chain to include Collectives as a trusted teleporter.\n\nFinally, I would expect a referendum to initiate the Alliance, which could come before or after the Relay Chain's recognition of the parachain as a teleporter. However, this is outside the scope of this discussion; I expect the Alliance founders to propose how they would like to launch.\n\nThe call details will be finalized when Parity publishes the [Collectives genesis release](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-collectives-v9290) and the Technical Committee indicates a rough enactment timeframe, which is needed to set the first period of the lease. The call will be a batch with `registrar.force_register` and `slots.force_lease` and the appropriate parameters.\n\n--------\n\nEDIT: Including call info.\n\nCall hash: `0x9ef867bcaaee9750487738c6e6537eb52a3047c7bb2f06eb30dc05073dae90d5`\n\nFor some reason Polkassembly won't allow me to add the entire Polkadot JS link for the call (guessing it is too large), but it is as follows:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DDU8FPX.png)",

      "content": "Hello, community!\n\n**The discussion with 96% ayes: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1295](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1295)**\n\nWe are going to represent Polkadot on the Web Summit this year. We want to get Treasury funding to partially cover direct Web Summit costs. All other costs will be covered by participating companies.\n\nWe find it crucial to participate in conferences with key web2 players and 70,000+ attendees, as well as teams from the biggest tech companies, to promote the mass adoption of web3 and generate buzz around the Polkadot.\n\nFor Polkadot, Web Summit is a major opportunity to:\n- attract attention to the web3 in general and, most importantly, Polkadot blockchain in particular;\n- showcase the power of decentralized technologies;\n- make a huge step to the mass adoption of web3;\n- open up new possibilities of successful partnerships for Polkadot community members;\n- appeal to potential investors;\n- expand loyal and engaged Polkadot community.\n\nIt is crucial to start working outside of web3 bubble for web3 to become simply Web. Just the mere presence of Polkadot at such a conference sends a strong signal to web3 and the web community.\n\nFull proposal with all calculations/details - [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9R-34OhkCzbWx_QxaDa-NcMquMUcEpw1rXHjZnCaZg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9R-34OhkCzbWx_QxaDa-NcMquMUcEpw1rXHjZnCaZg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe booth is in active development and is almost done (design is attached in the proposal).\n\nWe want to attract more Parachains and projects to this initiative! We need your support to showcase the power of decentralized technologies outside the web3 world together. \n\nWe believe that even in these strict timelines, we can worthy present Polkadot at the biggest Web conference and bring mass adoption.",

      "title": "Proposal for USDT Token Sufficiency on Statemint",
      "content": "[Tether](https://tether.to/en/) registered USDT on Statemint (asset ID `1984` - it can be verified here). The team is requesting Polkadot governance to make it sufficient such that it can pay transaction fees and exist on accounts without DOT. Tether's announcement can be found [HERE](https://tether.to/en/tether-tokens-usdt-live-on-polkadot/). Polkadot's announcement can be found [HERE](https://twitter.com/Polkadot/status/1573299786266050561).\n\nOn Statemint, assets can be Sufficient or Non-Sufficient. To hold a Non-Sufficient asset, the Statemint account needs to exist on-chain. This is different from Ethereum where a non-existent account can hold ERC-20 tokens, as users need to ensure that the receiver account has at least 0.1 DOT which is the Existential Deposit for a Statemint account. However, if an asset is Sufficient, the Existential Deposit in DOT on the receiver account is not needed to create the account; the asset itself is sufficient. The team is requesting this property to be voted by governance.\n\nThis proposal would allow much more flexibility for holders on Polkadot Network and the stablecoin will power transactions on Polkadot’s Statemint needed for asset deployment and balance-keeping of fungible and non-fungible tokens flowing across the web of blockchains.

StackUp breaks the typical learning journey into smaller, bite-sized pieces (that we call quests), offering users real currency rewards for finishing each quest. This format of smaller exercises with incremental rewards, encourages learners to tackle more quests and learn more, as well as encourages them to follow through and finish the quest.\n\nUpon project commencement, $50k USD of the original $80k USD was sought and obtained as the initial allocation.  Having completed the learn-and-earn campaign, we are pleased to announce the successful results, which can be viewed here: [Program Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcgDw0I3AXF7YDP6dFttETC6OgaGKAnouURdfwSRyAc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nGiven the successful execution of the project, this proposal submission seeks to acquire the remaining portion of the allocation of $30k USD, marking the conclusion to this project. After which, the StackUp team will continue to find new opportunities to educate more developers about Polkadot and the various projects in the ecosystem.\n\n**Key Links and References can be found in the links below:**\n\n- Detailed Proposal for the Learn-and-Earn Campaign: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NxH0-hxjttIXOxWgS0yURCpj2u2kJTCdT7gbFISqZSI/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Polkassembly - First Treasury Proposal for the request for first Allocation: [Link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/97)\n- Link to Motion: [Link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/169)\n- Link to Program Report: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pcgDw0I3AXF7YDP6dFttETC6OgaGKAnouURdfwSRyAc/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Link to Discussion Post for Second Allocation: [Link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1288)",

      "title": "Gossamer Ongoing Development Grant",
      "content": "Previous discussion: <https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1260>\n\n---\n\n- **Treasury Proposal:** Gossamer Ongoing Development Grant\n- **Proponent:** AFRI, `1dvvq2sZg55LfLqFmegU493oUaPWxJfjiYysP1eyovkX6hP` (`1413`)\n- **Beneficiary:** CHAINSAFE, `14gaKBxYkbBh2SKGtRDdhuhtyGAs5XLh55bE5x4cDi5CmL75`\n- **Date:** 09.09.2022\n- **Requested amount:** USD 1,998,117.60 in DOT on the day of submission using EMA30 rate by Subscan _(Oct 1st, 2022: EMA30 6.815 USD/DOT)_\n- **Scope:** Software development / Protocol \n\n**Short description:** Gossamer is a Polkadot host written in Go: a framework to build and run nodes for different blockchain protocols compatible with the Polkadot ecosystem, mainly but not limited to the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains. This proposal addresses the Polkadot treasury to consider a grant for the ongoing development by ChainSafe's Gossamer team for another 12 months after the successful collaboration with the Web3 Foundation Grants Program on the initial steps of this development. \n\n---\n\n**Context:** ChainSafe Systems [0], founded in 2017 in Toronto, is a Canadian blockchain development studio with more than 100 employees worldwide. Our vision is to move the various blockchain ecosystems closer, building bridges and increasing client diversity by providing alternative protocol implementations. With a strong emphasis on protocol engineering, we have been engaged by various clients and foundations, among others, in the Ethereum, Polkadot, COSMOS, and Filecoin ecosystems.\n\nInitially funded through a Web3 Foundation grant [1], our protocol team started implementing a Go-Lang Polkadot host in January 2019. Ever since three years and 1300 merged pull requests later, the client has seen more than 40 contributors. As a result, a Gossamer node today can act as an alternative full node for chains such as Polkadot or Kusama. However, it is not yet feature complete. A treasury allocation should cover the pending developments with approval from the community. We want to continue developing and maintaining Gossamer to extend its capabilities further to grow and stabilize the Polkadot ecosystem with an alternative client implementation that is actively used by the community.\n\nThe current team consists of seven full-time protocol engineers and a dedicated project manager. The source code is available on GitHub [2] under the terms of an LGPL v3.0 license.\n\nWhile the Web3 Foundation has entirely covered funding for the development in the past, this will be our first treasury proposal. Hopefully, this will secure our future operations, allow us to scale the team, and continue to broaden our scope while fostering our presence in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Problem Statement:** The Substrate blockchain framework enables developers to quickly assemble blockchains for many different use cases. However, it is locking the ecosystem down onto a single programming language, Rust, competing for resources in areas where collaboration is desired.\n\nOffering alternative frameworks in other programming languages should be a high-valued goal of the Polkadot community **as it opens up the ecosystem to a larger pool of engineers**. Thus far, Gossamer is not yet a generalized framework for building blockchains in Go; however, this will always be our central mission for the project.\n\n**Objective:** The overall goal is for Gossamer to provide the functionality needed to bring true client diversity to the Polkadot ecosystem. This entails, but is not limited to:\n- A **full-node client** capable of peering, synchronizing and seeding the most prominent relay chains and parachains of the Polkadot ecosystems.\n- **Block-production and finality** capability for relay chains and parachains (validators, collators).\n- **API services** to allow sharing chain and node states through standardized interfaces.\n- **Runtimes** generated in alternative programming languages such as Go.\n\nThe primary focus of Gossamer development has been implementing the protocols of the Polkadot host, the client architecture that hosts the Wasm runtime of a Polkadot-like relay chain. The first milestone on the Gossamer roadmap is to allow members of the Polkadot community to stake cryptocurrency behind a Gossamer block-authoring node on the Polkadot Network.\n\n**Deliverables:** The objectives of this proposal can be broken down into the following milestones in no particular order.\n- **Validator specification:** Gossamer currently runs in single-node development environments or in sync with other Gossamer nodes or older Substrate versions. A desirable goal for the next year would be **implementing the latest validator specification**, which breaks down into three major components.\n  - Transaction queue: Gossamer must be able to receive user-submitted extrinsics [3] and deliver them to the network. Furthermore, Gossamer must implement the transaction queue logic [4] to handle user-submitted transactions efficiently.\n  - Block production: Gossamer must be able to author blocks using the latest BABE block production protocol [5].\n  - Block finality: Gossamer must be able to participate in the latest GRANDPA block finalization protocol [6].\n- **Sync modes:** Gossamer can currently conduct a full bootstrap synchronization to the tip of the chain. This means that the node can use the chain specification [7] of a Polkadot-like network to connect to that network and to import and verify the blocks that make up the network's canonical chain; these blocks will be stored in Gossamer's key-value database. A desirable goal for next year's development would be to **update BABE and GRANDPA implementations to the latest specification and provide alternative synchronization modes**. \n  - State Integrity: Gossamer must implement Polkadot's Patricia-Merkle trie [8] and use it to generate proofs correctly.\n  - Fork Choice: Gossamer must tip-sync with a Polkadot-like network, which implies tracking multiple candidate forks at the head of the chain and following the best according to the specification.\n  - Warp Sync: Besides providing a full-synchronization service, it would be desirable to provide other modes such as warp sync.\n  - DB Imports: A Gossamer node should be able to bootstrap with a database snapshot at a given block height.\n- **RPC APIs:** Gossamer must implement the same WebSocket JSON-RPC APIs as the Substrate Polkadot implementation (PSP-6, [9]); this means that the Polkadot-JS API [a] should be able to **work seamlessly with a Gossamer host**.\n- **Telemetry:** A Gossamer client should be able to natively connect to any Polkadot Telemetry Service [b] to announce its presence. These Go-hosts should be identifiable by the Telemetry UI reporting the existence of alternative clients.\n- **Performance:** To make the client attractive, it's crucial to adjust the reality to the user's performance expectations concerning CPU usage, memory usage, and synchronization time. Metrics can be comparable with Parity's implementation.\n\nThe focus for the next development cycle is **matching the latest specification to be able to bootstrap a full Polkadot node and participate in consensus**, e.g., on a public testnet such as Westend. Success metrics can be defined by passing the respective test suites provided by the Web3 Foundation; the organization will partner on this proposal as technical advisor and deliverables auditor to ensure the completed milestones are technically sound. If unavailable, an additional deliverable could entail providing test suites for the respective deliverable above.\n\nPlease note that funds are requested from the community treasury. The Web3 Foundation technical team has no control over these funds and will not be rewarded as a reviewer of the milestones. The team will serve the sole purpose of evaluating deliverables in alignment with the community approval of this proposal. This role is based on their past participation in this project. It is expected for the ChainSafe team to publish deliverable reports after the Web3 Foundation's technical evaluation and before continuing with subsequent milestones.\n\n**Payment Conditions**: The requested amount for a 12-months ongoing development grant is USD 1,998,117.60 in DOT on the day of submission using the EMA30 rate by Subscan [c]. The allocation is asked for as a single, up-front payment to cover our ongoing development costs and for the team to be able to provide a runway to their developer resources.\n\nThe following resource table outlines the expected costs for the Gossamer team. The table consists of:\n- the current base cost to operate the team,\n- an 18% operational overhead to cover the costs of running the project as a team within ChainSafe Systems (e.g., operations, offices, equipment, tooling, infrastructure, legal, travel),\n- the potential to grow the team sustainability by another two engineers over the course of the following year,\n- as well as a 3% margin to protect against market volatility of the underlying DOT assets.\n\n```\n             | E2*    | E3*    | E4*    | TPM*   | Base Cost        | Cost +18% overhead |\n| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |\n| Month 0    | 3 FTE* | 3 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   120,000.00 | USD     141,600.00 |\n| Month 1    | 3 FTE* | 3 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   120,000.00 | USD     141,600.00 |\n| Month 2    | 3 FTE* | 3 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   120,000.00 | USD     141,600.00 |\n| Month 3    | 3 FTE* | 3 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   120,000.00 | USD     141,600.00 |\n| Month 4    | 3 FTE* | 3 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   120,000.00 | USD     141,600.00 |\n| Month 5    | 3 FTE* | 3 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   120,000.00 | USD     141,600.00 |\n| Month 6    | 4 FTE* | 4 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   154,000.00 | USD     181,720.00 |\n| Month 7    | 4 FTE* | 4 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   154,000.00 | USD     181,720.00 |\n| Month 8    | 4 FTE* | 4 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   154,000.00 | USD     181,720.00 |\n| Month 9    | 4 FTE* | 4 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   154,000.00 | USD     181,720.00 |\n| Month 10   | 4 FTE* | 4 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   154,000.00 | USD     181,720.00 |\n| Month 11   | 4 FTE* | 4 FTE* | 1 FTE* | 1 FTE* | USD   154,000.00 | USD     181,720.00 |\n| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |\n| USD Sum    |        |        |        |        | USD 1,644,000.00 | USD   1,939,920.00 |\n| +3% margin |        |        |        |        |                  | USD      58,197.60 |\n| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |\n| USD Total  |        |        |        |        |                  | USD   1,998,117.60 |\n                                                                     ====================\n```\n\n_[*] Abbreviations: E2 - Engineer II (Mid-level Engineer), E3 - Engineer III (Senior Engineer), E4 - Engineer IV (Technical Lead), TPM - Technical Project Manager, FTE - Full-Time Employee_\n\nThe beneficiary of this proposal is ChainSafe Systems Inc, Toronto, Canada.

Only this user can edit this description and the title. If you own this account, login and tell us more about your proposal.\n\nHello everyone,\n\nThis proposal is submitted by three Polkadot teams: Bitgreen, Sequester, and Evercity, detailing a common good collaboration to measure and report the collective carbon footprint of the entire Polkadot and Kusama networks, and offset their emissions with carbon credits from within the Dotsama ecosystem. It builds on the pre-existing W3F grant issued to Sequester to develop a pallet to translate parachain treasury funds into tokenized carbon credits. The following proposal resolves a prerequisite to determine a methodology, set of measurement parameters and reporting standard to measure the electricity consumption and approximate emissions of each participating parachain with real-time periodicity and verifiable accuracy. The final deliverable will be an open-sourced dashboard and the launch of the treasury-to-carbon credits pallet. Several parachain teams have committed to backing referendum on their local chains to adopt this functionality, and are excited to integrate it pending governance approval including Acala, Astar, Interlay, Bifrost and Kilt.\n\nThe Dashboard and initial audit are scheduled to be finished by sub0 in November with the Sequester and Bitgreen parachain colaboration early Q1 2023.\n\nPlease see the document for details: \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/19mGYD10uWB8SXwJeqdgRe8o5VayaVYnnVvPkm_TtjPw](url)\n\nAdam & Dennis CEO and CTO, Bitgreen",

      "content": "Polkadot community, the time has finally come:\n\nNomination pools can go live any time now in Polkadot. This is a great milestone, removing any barrier for native relay chain staking for DOT-holders. This proposal suggests the following configuration for nomination pools on Polkadot, following Kian's advice from the staking team:\n\n**1 DOT to join a pool.** \"I actually used to suggest 5 DOTs for a slightly higher sybil resistance, but I think the 5x factor here is not that big of a difference, and allowing staker holders to join pools with at little as 1 DOT is a nice milestone. Moreover, this sybil attack is not really viable as we can easily lift the limit on maximum members (mentioned below) and then it would have no effect.\"\n\n**200 DOTs to create a pool.** \"This is not a cost or deposit. It is actually the initial collateral/stake of the pool, and by setting it to 200, it will ensure that all pools have an initial stake that’s more than the minimum that’s needed to earn rewards (~170 as of now). This initial stake still earns rewards for the creator of the pool, and can be unstaked once the pool is being dissolved.\"\n\n**Maximum of 64 pools and 16k members in all pools**. \"These are only there so that if there is a bug, we can easily migrate the data and perform a fix. If we reach these limits, they can trivially be lifted to a higher value. Moreover, if pools work fine for e.g. ~6 months, we can proceed with lifting them altogether.\"\n\n\"I have worked hard on communicating that: “Pools are designed to be infinitely scalable”, I am suggesting these limits only out of extra caution.\"\n\nThis initial configuration composition, aiming to be presented for a vote if the community agrees, can be found [HERE](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x270a0100e40b540200000000000000000000000100204aa9d101000000000000000000000140000000010040000000). Preimage is submitted. Please note this is an external motion needing root origin: after Council approval, the community will vote to approve or reject this proposal in referenda queue. ",

      "content": "The image composition is incorrect as it sets the min amount to join the pool to 5 DOTS instead of 1 DOT: the right proposal is [this one](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/270), up for vote now, \n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPolkadot community, the time has finally come:\n\nNomination pools can go live any time now in Polkadot. This is a great milestone, removing any barrier for native relay chain staking for DOT-holders. This proposal suggests the following configuration for nomination pools on Polkadot, following Kian's advice from the staking team:\n\n**1 DOT to join a pool.** \"I actually used to suggest 5 DOTs for a slightly higher sybil resistance, but I think the 5x factor here is not that big of a difference, and allowing staker holders to join pools with at little as 1 DOT is a nice milestone. Moreover, this sybil attack is not really viable as we can easily lift the limit on maximum members (mentioned below) and then it would have no effect.\"\n\n**200 DOTs to create a pool.** \"This is not a cost or deposit. It is actually the initial collateral/stake of the pool, and by setting it to 200, it will ensure that all pools have an initial stake that’s more than the minimum that’s needed to earn rewards (~170 as of now). This initial stake still earns rewards for the creator of the pool, and can be unstaked once the pool is being dissolved.\"\n\n**Maximum of 64 pools and 16k members in all pools**. \"These are only there so that if there is a bug, we can easily migrate the data and perform a fix. If we reach these limits, they can trivially be lifted to a higher value. Moreover, if pools work fine for e.g. ~6 months, we can proceed with lifting them altogether.\"\n\n\"I have worked hard on communicating that: “Pools are designed to be infinitely scalable”, I am suggesting these limits only out of extra caution.\"\n\nThis initial configuration composition, aiming to be presented for a vote if the community agrees, can be found [HERE](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x270a0100743ba40b00000000000000000000000100204aa9d101000000000000000000000140000000010040000000). Preimage is submitted. Please note this is an external motion needing root origin: after Council approval, the community will vote to approve or reject this proposal in referenda queue. ",

This is the timeline of the summit (WIP)\n\nThe motivation behind this initiative is that we think that Polkadot needs more exposure in the US. Having a Polkadot local event during a big conference is effective and needed.\n\nWe have confirmed speakers from the following top teams in Dotsama including Parity, Astar, Acala, Parallel, Nodle, Zeitgeist, Oak, Phala, Polkahaus, and Manta, and trying to invite more ecosystem projects.\n\n[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JCQCBFXDV84X-6r6EwWhhKTvsoYm-sVkZw7OssKAmlk/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1) is the proposal.

The font will be specifically designed for small size screen use, come in light, regular and bold weights with matching italics and a corresponding monospaced version for coding. The font will also come with a suite of variable iconography and cover both latin and cyrillic scripts. We aim to wrap this all up in a single file as a cutting edge variable font, offering both technical and design benefits.\n\nUnlike the Polkadot brand font that was designed for large sizes, this typeface will be built specifically for small size use across the Dotsama ecosystem. As an open source font our aim is that it has utility for users around the world.\n\n[Read full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KlK51o5JfTAwJQlv7AkZtv5FL5oKDtiUd5GOtKFT5GA/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)",

      "title": "YieldBay Proposal: Listing platform for all dotsama liquidity pools and yield farms",
      "content": "[YieldBay](https://yieldbay.io) started out, about 9 months ago, as an effort to reduce information asymmetry and lower the barrier to entry for liquidity providers and yield farmers within the dotsama ecosystem and make it easier for protocols to acquire liquidity for their token pools.\n\nFor details see [Introducing Yield Bay - by Batman](https://blog.yieldbay.io/p/intro).\n\nDotsama’s multi-chain and interoperable infrastructure enables novel solutions to be built, which were previously not possible. However, this novelty also brings complexity.\n\nSpending time in various community chat servers, we noticed similar questions from community members, stemming from the problem of information asymmetry in finding and participating in liquidity pools and yield farms.\n\n![Information asymmetry in finding and participating in liquidity pools and yield farms](https://i.postimg.cc/nL86ZKgm/collage.png)\n\nThis problem affects not only LPs and yield farmers but also protocols, as they suffer from low discoverability and lower conversions, resulting in lower liquidity for their token pools and higher slippage. That’s a big problem if you want people to be able to buy your token. Hence, it is a huge barrier to a new project’s success.\n\nOur goal is to help reduce the time and effort costs of liquidity acquisition and provision for protocols and end-users (LP/yield farmers) respectively, by making it easier to find and list liquidity pools and yield farms in one central location.\n\nIn this proposal, we are seeking to fund the development of an aggregation platform for finding and listing liquidity pools and yield farms across the dotsama ecosystem to reduce problem of information asymmetry mentioned above. We believe such a platform will be mutually beneficial for users as well as protocols.\n\n**Progress so far:**\n\n- We've already built a proof-of-concept for this, which is live on [list.yieldbay.io](https://list.yieldbay.io)\n- The platform has had 350+ unique visitors who spent an average time of over 4min on the site\n- Within a week since we launched YieldBay List (on July 11th, 2022), we’ve received listing requests from over 5 different protocols including Tapio/Taiga, BeamSwap, Darwinia, et al. (**disclaimer:** please note that this **does NOT** imply a partnership or endorsement between YieldBay and these projects)\n\n**NOTE:** This submission is only for the first milestone. We shall make separate submissions for the remaining milestones.\n\nPlease see the [full proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fssDqgPtIjdwO0XfJW5po94JHMf1ozdjeLwM2a40zJ8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThank you to everyone who contributed during the [community feedback stage](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1171) of this proposal. We have corresponded with everyone that has provided their inputs in the comment section of the discussion thread.",

      "content": "- Discussion: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1223\n- Requested Amount: $25k\n- The average price of DOT in the last 7 days: $7.44\n- Requested DOT: 3360 DOT\n\nThis is Sota Watanabe, founder of Astar Network. On behalf of the following projects, I submit this proposal on Polkassembly. (Astar, Acala, Ajuna, Bifrost, DFG, Efinity, Efficient Frontier, Integritee, Unique, LongHash, Jsquare, Moonbeam, OnFinality, Phala, SubQuery, Equilibrium,Tribe, Web3Go, SubWallet, CESS and Acurast)\n\nToken2049 is the biggest event in Asia this year and more than 3000 people are going to attend. We think that having a great Polkadot presence during this event is important especially to be recognized in Asia. The above 21 projects are going to either participate in token2049 or visit Singapore. These teams have come together to organize a Polkadot event, inviting not only Polkadot team members but also non-Polkadot ecosystem members to help build the Polkadot brand in Asia.\n\nThe goal of this event is to make a stronger Polkadot brand and show the unity of the ecosystem. Our KPIs are 1. 300+ registrations and 2. 200+ attendees.\n\nPlease see the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HyBvtQ1ljW0r6-snUtFmoNDoDRzC1L1oJV3WSsLQ0n8/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1).\n\n[The event page](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/polkadot-asia-lounge-party-tickets-413358926677\n) is already published and more than 300 people already registered. \n",

      "title": "Milestone 2 Proposal: Polkadot Hackathon for 200 Students and Educators",
      "content": "**Requested Allocation:** $40,000 (milestone 2 hackathon for Polkadot)\n\n*DOT amount calculated via EMA on 9 September 2022 at GMT+0 0845hrs: 1 DOT ~ USD$7.55. USD$40,000 ~ 5,298.01 DOT\n\n**Proponent:** EasyA 5FQqvRHgBEUZG17qs9cNFH6ZSSVyAwhb7D6dKjGWb8xgKFkP\n\n**Short Description:**\nWe’re thrilled to announce our report on the successful completion of the EasyA x Polkadot hackathon (check out the highlight reel [here](https://youtu.be/vo4McHKpchY))! We held the hackathon on 30-31 July in London and are delighted that we exceeded all our targets. Overall, 27 awesome projects were created by 250 students from 30 universities. We educated them on how to build parachains/dApps in Dotsama, and we raised huge awareness of the Polkadot ecosystem amongst thousands of new student developers while we were promoting the hackathon. We have documented the hackathon fully [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10GTdZby0vj1qrmmUKrmWpat2XDsB7W38i52gfTdq668/edit?usp=sharing), along with our key successes and learnings for others to draw on when hosting future hackathons. \n\nAs we have completely fulfilled the objectives of the proposal, we are therefore requesting the reimbursement of Milestone 2 (to reward winners and cover final costs). The prizes will be distributed in DOT to the winners. Although the value of DOT has dropped since the Milestone 1 proposal, the participants were aware token prices fluctuate. This is in accordance with our original Milestone 1 proposal which was approved [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/215).\n\nWe’re looking forward to building on this momentum and bringing more students to the Polkadot ecosystem soon!",

This motion accepts them all and opens return channels.\n\n**Handy Info**\n\n- **Treasury Address**: `13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB`\n- **Treasury AccountId:** `0x6d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n- **Statemint Address:** `13YMK2edbuhwMBxeUWm9c643A2wyYHwSVh1bCM7tShtg7Dtk`\n- **Statemint AccountId:** `0x70617261e8030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n\n- **Parachains that aim to open channels**: 2021, 2031, 2032, 2035, 2046.\n\n**Call Construction**\n\nThese are constructed backwards. That is, the call to use as the proposal is at the end.\n\n**Relay Chain Call to Execute**\n\nFirst, we need the call that Statemint will execute on the Relay Chain. This accepts all channel requests and returns channel requests to the initiators.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Polkadot): \n\n```\n0x1a02283c01e50700003c01ef0700003c01f00700003c01f30700003c01fe0700003c00e5070000e8030000009001003c00ef070000e8030000009001003c00f0070000e8030000009001003c00f3070000e8030000009001003c00fe070000e803000000900100\n```\n\n**Message from Statemint**\n\nThe above message needs to come from Statemint. So we put it into an XCM (the “Transact” instruction) along with purchasing some execution capacity and returning any leftover fees to the Treasury.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Statemint): \n\n```\n0x1f0001010002140004000000000700c817a80413000000000700c817a80400060002286bee9d011a02283c01e50700003c01ef0700003c01f00700003c01f30700003c01fe0700003c00e5070000e8030000009001003c00ef070000e8030000009001003c00f0070000e8030000009001003c00f3070000e8030000009001003c00fe070000e803000000900100140d01010000000004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\n**Proposal on the Relay Chain**\n\nBut, governance is on the Relay Chain, not Statemint. So take some DOT from the Treasury (100 DOT for 10 channels at 10 DOT each plus 2 DOT for fees) and send a message to Statemint telling it to send a message back. This is the proposal to vote on.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Polkadot): \n\n``` \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\n```\n\n- Call Hash: `0xfa5da8a4d9ef08dd22dfbc189861cbb9275dc8c52e4ce9b04f21cc830b3d5617`\n\nPreimage has already been submitted for verification by the community as well.

      "content": "**Note: PLEASE REJECT - The proposal will fail because it does not provide enough weight. A new proposal will be submitted for vote.**\n\nFive more parachains have requested an HRMP channel with Statemint. This motion accepts them all and opens return channels.\n\n**Handy Info**\n\n- **Treasury Address**: `13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwFGyDvVd1y27Tt8tkntv6Q7JVPhFsTB`\n- **Treasury AccountId:** `0x6d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n- **Statemint Address:** `13YMK2edbuhwMBxeUWm9c643A2wyYHwSVh1bCM7tShtg7Dtk`\n- **Statemint AccountId:** `0x70617261e8030000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`\n\n- **Parachains that aim to open channels**: 2021, 2031, 2032, 2035, 2046.\n\n**Call Construction**\n\nThese are constructed backwards. That is, the call to use as the proposal is at the end.\n\n**Relay Chain Call to Execute**\n\nFirst, we need the call that Statemint will execute on the Relay Chain. This accepts all channel requests and returns channel requests to the initiators.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Polkadot): \n\n```\n0x1a02283c01e50700003c01ef0700003c01f00700003c01f30700003c01fe0700003c00e5070000e8030000009001003c00ef070000e8030000009001003c00f0070000e8030000009001003c00f3070000e8030000009001003c00fe070000e803000000900100\n```\n\n**Message from Statemint**\n\nThe above message needs to come from Statemint. So we put it into an XCM (the “Transact” instruction) along with purchasing some execution capacity and returning any leftover fees to the Treasury.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Statemint): \n\n```\n0x1f0001010002140004000000000700c817a80413000000000700c817a80400060002286bee9d011a02283c01e50700003c01ef0700003c01f00700003c01f30700003c01fe0700003c00e5070000e8030000009001003c00ef070000e8030000009001003c00f0070000e8030000009001003c00f3070000e8030000009001003c00fe070000e803000000900100140d01010000000004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\n**Proposal on the Relay Chain**\n\nBut, governance is on the Relay Chain, not Statemint. So take some DOT from the Treasury (100 DOT for 10 channels at 10 DOT each plus 2 DOT for fees) and send a message to Statemint telling it to send a message back. This is the proposal to vote on.\n\n- Encoded Call Data (Polkadot): \n\n```\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\n```\n\n- Call Hash: `0x66533cf91c782761160b5ed11a0f65ca5d7d752040f94750875ace851b3f697f`\n\nPreimage has already been submitted for verification by the community as well.

      "content": "This is proposal for Milestones 1&2.\n\nDOT/EUR exchange rate calculated as 7.3481 by EMA7 (EMA with 168 period frame) by [Kraken](https://trade.kraken.com/snapshot/ccbh735b5aau6chkob5g-kraken-dot-eur)\n\nOur team proposes to design an open source hardware storage for dotsama ecosystem.\n\n[Please see complete proposal on Skiff](https://app.skiff.com/docs/6e1d3e9f-9e2c-4413-9190-9c39cda20763#yJcS2WZZbiuFk4Pe3W5nycQ7vcjEbrXkbfcf2EKIiV4=)\n\nProject name is Kampela, Finnish word for flounder fish. The device is envisioned as flat card mostly consisting of e-paper screen and few controls (and it allows keys to stay safely in depth).\n\nKampela is a hardware version of Parity Signer. It is a small card-shaped device (ideally comparable to a credit card form factor, to be carried in a wallet when needed) that accepts data through unidirectional NFC port and shows output on a monochrome electronic paper screen. It has cryptographic strongbox with elliptic curves supported by Substrate — which only stores private keys (after initial import) and performs all signing operations on-chip.\n\nKampela is designed to be a comparatively low-cost (below €100, in contrast to €500+ for a Signer-compatible smartphone) single-purpose device, which would only support a single seed phrase per unit, operated via a drastically simplified user interface. However, it would have all the security features of Parity Signer: a full-featured SURI account derivation system, transactions preview, metadata updates, logging.\n\nAs something that supports the same QR code output formats as Signer, it would be able to drop-in replace Signer when providing signatures back to a mobile/desktop wallet. The only challenge would be in transforming the current QR-driven input format of Signer into a suitable NFC payload. Alongside with native support in some apps (which would require software modification) this can also be achieved with a tiny “translator” app for a regular (online, not necessary trusted — one’s usual daily driver) mobile phone: it would snap a QR code with the transaction details and (statelessly, without any extra features or complicated UI) transform that into an NFC payload.\n\nKampela is a natural (and long-discussed) extension of Parity Signer to leverage the most out of modern hardware-based crypto chips and drastically reduce Signer’s attack surface: no mobile OS, not extra platform features, no unexpected communication methods or airplane mode to take care of.\n\nKampela is not a wallet! It is a signing tool, it is not able to track on-chain balances, validate things over chain-provided information or generate transactions on itself.\n\nThe scope of this proposal does not include actual production, but does result in all preliminary development required for production. Hopefully, many assembly shops would rush in to compete with us and each other!\n\n[This proposal was prevoiusly posted in Discussions](../post/1227)\n\nEdit: [Milestone 1 report](https://app.skiff.com/docs/2b25845a-4a00-4bf4-aaff-3de4a70d4ad7#zSepFgAI0EetUe7eIp2Tlgu/RnhMjnAJRDecVUiVmhQ=)\n\nEdit: [Milestone 2 report](https://app.skiff.com/docs/5dcbeadc-e5f3-4f29-8476-e8fcb7786585#ZNnc%2FdmSz3dYkUNc%2BI%2BiarGsZKa0W9uUN25ZqCySPAg%3D)",

      "content": "A Ziggurat is a rectangular stepped tower that uses precise measurements to ensure that each foundation can support the layers above.\n\nThis metaphor can be applied to network testing by defining three layers:\n\n1. Conformance: adherence to the network protocol\n2. Performance: healthy throughput under pressure\n3. Resistance: the withstanding of malicious behavior\n\nZiggurat, by [Equilibrium](https://equilibrium.co/), is a set of tools that allows node developers to test these three layers extensively and ensure that each new release does not introduce bugs, performance bottlenecks, or security flaws.\n\nAs mentioned in the conclusion of the recent Trail of Bits report: It’s only a matter of time before a blockchain network is completely toppled by a network-level hack. This proposal will detail why this work is critical, and how we will go about solving it.\n\nFor the full proposal, see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing",

[Polkawatch](https://polkawatch.app/) entered in production in 2022 Q2.\n\nThis proposal aims to fund the 2022 Q3 Continued Operation and implement Software Development and infrastructure improvements.\n\nOur detailed [proposal can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hh1Vjn2tPwx2fAPFoY5WfOeltEJy-B-1HlukPSHLTI0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nCommunity feedabck to our proposal can be found in the [Discussion Post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1212).\n",

      "title": "YieldBay Proposal: Listing platform for all dotsama liquidity pools and yield farms",
      "content": "[YieldBay](https://yieldbay.io) started out, about 9 months ago, as an effort to reduce information asymmetry and lower the barrier to entry for liquidity providers and yield farmers within the dotsama ecosystem and make it easier for protocols to acquire liquidity for their token pools.\n\nFor details see [Introducing Yield Bay - by Batman](https://blog.yieldbay.io/p/intro).\n\nDotsama’s multi-chain and interoperable infrastructure enables novel solutions to be built, which were previously not possible. However, this novelty also brings complexity.\n\nSpending time in various community chat servers, we noticed similar questions from community members, stemming from the problem of information asymmetry in finding and participating in liquidity pools and yield farms.\n\n![Information asymmetry in finding and participating in liquidity pools and yield farms](https://i.postimg.cc/nL86ZKgm/collage.png)\n\nThis problem affects not only LPs and yield farmers but also protocols, as they suffer from low discoverability and lower conversions, resulting in lower liquidity for their token pools and higher slippage. That’s a big problem if you want people to be able to buy your token. Hence, it is a huge barrier to a new project’s success.\n\nOur goal is to help reduce the time and effort costs of liquidity acquisition and provision for protocols and end-users (LP/yield farmers) respectively, by making it easier to find and list liquidity pools and yield farms in one central location.\n\nIn this proposal, we are seeking to fund the development of an aggregation platform for finding and listing liquidity pools and yield farms across the dotsama ecosystem to reduce problem of information asymmetry mentioned above. We believe such a platform will be mutually beneficial for users as well as protocols.\n\n**Progress so far:**\n\n- We've already built a proof-of-concept for this, which is live on [list.yieldbay.io](https://list.yieldbay.io)\n- The platform has had 350+ unique visitors who spent an average time of over 4min on the site\n- Within a week since we launched YieldBay List (on July 11th, 2022), we’ve received listing requests from over 5 different protocols including Tapio/Taiga, BeamSwap, Darwinia, et al. (**disclaimer:** please note that this **does NOT** imply a partnership or endorsement between YieldBay and these projects)\n\n**NOTE:** This submission is only for the first milestone. We shall make separate submissions for the remaining milestones.\n\nPlease see the [full proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fssDqgPtIjdwO0XfJW5po94JHMf1ozdjeLwM2a40zJ8/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThank you to everyone who contributed during the [community feedback stage](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1171) of this proposal. We have corresponded with everyone that has provided their inputs in the comment section of the discussion thread.",

May had a higher activity than the rest of the quarter which also had our largest daily responses in the quarter of over 224 million in a single day to Polkadot. \n\nWe continued to execute on our efforts to provide unprecedented service stability and reliability to this ecosystem. All supported networks exceeded our 99.9% target, including 99.98% uptime for Polkadot over the last 90 days . At this stage, OnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% availability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.\n\nBetween 2022-04-01 and 2022-06-31 our Polkadot API service has:\n\n- Served a total of 12,264,823,022 (12 billion) responses\n- Accumulated over 85 TB of data egress \n- The highest daily total was 224,203,539 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 133 million responses each day.\n- Westend had over 609  million API responses in the period\n- Statemint had over 353 million API responses in the period\n- All time totals for Polkadot is 65,360,914,521 (65 Billion) since November, 2020\n- At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend was 99.98%, 99.98%, and 99.99%\n\n**Full Proposal:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpNAYIdSlF9_uofueNHMkmvEtUPExBnJ92zZRgk9Afs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cpNAYIdSlF9_uofueNHMkmvEtUPExBnJ92zZRgk9Afs/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Fido Wallet(s)",
      "content": "👋 *Hola* dear community and council! I'm [Daniel](https://github.com/olanod), long time ecosystem builder, senior \"king\" ambassador and founder of the [Virto Network](https://virto.network), the future hub of sustainable d-commerce and services for Polkadot. \n\nEarlier this year [with your support](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/825) my team and I built [`libwallet`](https://github.com/virto-network/libwallet), an ultra-light and portable framework for creating fast, secure wallets of all kinds(web apps, extensions, mobile, desktop, hardware, hosted, etc.). It has been an on-going effort of continuous redesign and iteration to get to a point where we are now comfortable with its current architecture to start building real-world and user facing products that accommodate the many interesting use cases of our interconnected ecosystem.\n\nIt's our mission to *reeally* bring blockchain to the masses, for more than two years we've been creating solid foundations* and have being learning first hand from regular citizens what might take for people to use blockchain technology without realizing it and how not to compromise decentralization in the process.\n\n*_**Previous work**: Web3 grant for [orml-payments](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/payments), Kusama funded [Sube](https://github.com/virto-network/sube), [Kreivo](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1520) common good parachain for Kusama, [Bloque](https://bloque.app) insta-stores, decentralized on&off ramps._\n\n## Problem\n\nAlthough a lot of progress has been made all over the place to ease the entry barrier to the Web3, we are still miles away from reaching mass adoption, it's inspiring to see the many efforts the community put in educating new users in the ways of blockchains and decentralization but there's still a long, possibly never ending journey ahead.   \n\nIt's great to see how the blockchain industry has one of the highest levels of innovation and technology advancement ever seen, the field moves at incredible speeds that are hard even for seasoned technologists to catch up, trying to reeducate the world in \"the new better ways\" is a common approach in Web3 however it might not be the best option, we could be neglecting the big majority of the population that won't try to follow the latest and greatest, instead we need to be inclusive and find ways to translate the new revolutionary ideas to a common language that results familiar to the people.\n\n## Solution\n\nWe want help newcomers to easily navigate the world of Web3, wallets are the first interaction point of a user but we are starting simple and a bit different, with a set of constraints that I'll call now _the mom rule_, any term or action that would  require me to explain my mom what it is should be avoided, terms like(at least initially) blockchain, private key, hash, staking, NFTs, browser extension, or even wallet don't pass the mom rule so they are not making it in the first cut since they need explanation.\n\nNo metaverse-enabled-NFT-capable killer wallet this time, instead let us introduce you what we hope will become your reliable partner in the quest of exploring the sometimes scary Web3.\n\n## [**Fido**](http://fido.sh) 🐶  Your trustworthy Web3 companion\n![Logo Fido](https://fido.sh/fido.svg) \n\nFido is more than a wallet, it's a development platform. On top of `libwallet` and a plugin runtime we've [prototyped before](https://github.com/virto-network/valor) we are building an ecosystem of wallets for different use cases that can be extended with a variety of services(skills and tricks) developed by the community in their language of preference(JS and WASM). Our target audience being non crypto-native users(including developers) means our product has to feel familiar(e.g. easy login, familiar technologies) yet decentralized.  \nThe Fido project breaks down mainly in two pieces,\n\n- **Fido bot**: Your companion as hosted wallet that can be interacted with via chat using Matrix, the decentralized communications protocol(bridges to other chats can come later) or other protocols like a traditional HTTP API that gives developers access the different **skills** your Fido has learned. There will be multiple ways to install Fido so it can stay alert 24/7 and give you a hand whenever you need, depending on the platform it will use the most appropriate libwallet vault backend to keep secrets secure, an interesting one being a vault based on Matrix's [SSSS](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/implementing-more-advanced-e-2-ee-features-such-as-cross-signing#3-implementing-ssss) that we have [prototyped](https://github.com/virto-network/summa/pull/9), it allows backing up your wallet securely in your Matrix account to reduce the risk of losing access.\n\n  - **Self-hosted** provided as a binary, docker image, or per-configured OS image that can be burned directly to a linux computer as small as a RaspberryPi Zero.\n  - **Embedded Hardware**: Mini-Fido provided as firmware for popular microchips. Initial support for ESP32(-C3) and (future bonus based on what I have available) nrf52840/nrf9160 or the super tiny SAM L11 that could become more of a complementary chewing toy/key-holder/jewellery for Fido that can be powered with just an NFC field.\n  - **In browser**_(not yet in scope)_ backed by a combination of service/shared workers(cool web technology) that allows Fido running fully decentralized in your browser without having to install anything. We would also provide an embeddable iframe/web-component that allows third-party applications access the many skills of your Fido. For Virto Marketplaces it will be an important feature that allows executing payments or approve certain transactions.\n  - **[Matrix app service](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/application-services)**_(not in scope)_ For communities(like Virto's local communities and marketplaces) with their own Matrix server, this allows non-technical users to have an exclusive companion created for them automatically as soon as they join.\n  - **Desktop shell**_(not in scope)_ Embedded in the desktop application.👇\n\n- **Fido Shell**: A decentralized super-app for the Web(not an extension), desktop, mobile and terminal. It's  the graphical interface and Matrix client used to manage your Fido(s), where you can teach it new skills or tricks(mini appplets) and aggregate the many compatible applications created by the community.\n_NOTE:  Initiall functionality will be very basic, we will only provide an \"accounts skill\" with a simple applet for minimal token transfers support and a very simple chat._\n\n  - **Web**: Hosted in [fido.sh](https://fido.sh) and in decentralized form.\n  - **Desktop**: As single executable file that works(should) in most platforms(I'll personally only test on Linux but other team members and community will for extended support).\n  - **Mobile**(not in scope): Very similar deployment as the desktop application for IOS and Android. \n\n> ⚠️ To set expectations right, this first delivery of the Fido bot and the Fido shell should be consider experimental software not suitable to for managing large amounts of money that could be lost due to bugs in any of the components of our system. After launch we hope to gather enough feedback from the early adopters in the community before we recommend Fido for production use. \n\n> 🤔 Hard-core crypto fans might initially find the wallet boring as we are focused more on the real-world use cases of Virto that need to pass the _mom rule_, like buying a t-shirt, ordering food, calling a taxi, etc.\n\n## Development and Milestones\n\nWe will divide the work in 3 stages that will last a total of **4-5 months**, after previous experiences developing small pieces of software at a time that are hard to visualize as part of a bigger whole, this time we aim for a longer runway as it has proven difficult to attract/keep talent when working conditions are short term driven and uncertain.\n\n### Stage 1 - Design and architecture\nEstimated duration: **1 month**\n\n```\n| Task                                         | role  | hours |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Project planning and break-down in GH issues | lead  |  1w   |\n| Shell concept design                         | desig |  1w   |\n| Brand, logo, web design and components       | desig |  2w   |\n| Basic fido.sh with chat for updates          | f-dev |  2w   |\n```\n\n### Stage 2 - Wallet backends, Skills API & Shell UI components\nEstimated duration: **2 months**\n\n**This is the main stage of development for creating the core building blocks with great emphasis in embedded(no_std) support.**\n\n```\n| Task                                         | role  | hours |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Libwallet embedded vault (hardware keys)     | e-dev |  2w   |\n| Libwallet Matrix vault with embedded support | b-dev |  2w   |\n| Libwallet `pass` vault for hosted Fido       | b-dev |  1w   |\n| *Libwallet BLE proxy for Fido->mini-Fido     | e-dev |  3w   |\n| APIs design and \"Skills SDK\" prototype       | lead  |  2w   |\n| Web components for shell and tricks/applets  | f-dev |  4w   |\n| Fido Skills JS+WASM runtime                  | b-dev |  3w   |\n```\n_* Bonus with low priority_\n\n### Stage 3 - Integrations and deployments\nEstimated duration: **1 month**\n``` \n| Task                                         | role  | hours |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Bot and Skills management Skill/API          | b-dev |  1w   |\n| Blockchain&Accounts skill with Sube library  | b-dev |  2w   |\n| Shell implementation and bot integration     | f-dev |  3w   |\n| Accounts applet implementation               | f-dev |  2w   |\n| *Bot management applet                       | f-dev |  1w   |\n| *Developer applet for debugging              | f-dev |  1w   |\n| Shell and Bot packages(image,docker,bin,...) | f-dev |  1w   |\n| Testing and QA                               | lead  |  1w   |\n| Infrastructure set-up and server deployments | lead  |  1w   |\n```\n_* Bonus with low priority_\n\nEstimated total hours = `31w * 30h/w = 930h`  \nTotal USD cost with avg. hourly rate = `930h * USD$75/h = USD$69_750`  \n**Total DOT cost** = `USD$69_750 / 7.394 USD/DOT(EMA30) = 9_433 DOT`",

The payment involved in this proposal does not include any software development, human resources, etc. \n\nPreviously, every infrastructure cost of Subscan was applied by submitting treasury proposals separately. The application time was asynchronous and the process was complicated, which is easy to cause some confusion to users, and it is inconvenient to clearly obtain the monthly cost. Therefore , this application will count all unpaid infrastructure costs of the polkadot network before June 30, 2022, including:\n\n- GCP: January 1st - June 30th\n- Datadog: January 1st - June 30th\n- Cloudflare: April 15th - June 30th\n\nIn the future, the billing time of all bills will be completely unified, which is more convenient for community management and supervision.\n\nThis time, we plan to apply for a total of **50,814 USD in Polkadot**, the amount of DOT will be converted based on the **EMA7 price** on the day of the official submission.  \n\n- 2022-07-27 10:59:42 (+UTC), Block #11343941\n- DOT EMA7 Price ( USD ): 7.051;\n- Number of DOT: 7,205.831\n> https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=50814&type=time&from=USD&to=DOT&time=1658919600\n\n**Billing details can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXSELzfmNH1CP9JbI5Nq1wu8H83vnxJJ22TEjkF2Wgg/edit?usp=sharing).**",

      "title": "Proposal: Polkaevent - A one stop event discovery platform for the Dotsama ecosystem",
      "content": "### **THE PROPOSAL**\n\n**Description**\n\n\nOne of the key pillars for the growth of a particular technology revolves around community events organised by the technology educators and other members of the community. Even though you have events that happen today in the Polkadot ecosystem, the discovery of these events still remains quite cumbersome. You might find some event details here and there from twitter to Polkassembly, but it's difficult for users to find them without going out of their way to keep up with these channels. \n\nPolkaevent focuses on bringing these events together by listing all of them on one single platform thereby taking away the pain of discovery from the end user. It also aims to use its social channels to market those events. \n\n**Dotsama Calendar**\n\n\nDotsama calendar showcases everything that’s happening in the Dotsama ecosystem along with the relevant details of the location where that’s happening. So be it an airdrop, a new Parachain launch or just regular news, you can find all the info in the calendar.\n\nThe current calendar is limited as in it just shows things around proposals and only has an option for online events. This current calendar is designed to work with the parachains and relay chains where it’ll showcase events around the chain. It will show events around chain upgrades, new parachain launches, airdrops/other events for that chain. In fact it will also show referenda dates for a particular parachain.\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/HEtoZGH.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DsvoRAn.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/a/1DAU2Ju.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/fwgpcXc.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/jj0TbVZx/Polkaevent-calender-general.png)\n\n\n\n**Bounties**\n\n\nThe bounties section in Polkaevent lists out all the bounties that are part of the Dotsama ecosystem along with their respective details. This is a first draft of the design so please take this with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\n![](https://imgur.com/9aF6ZXN.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more details about the team, V1 Design and milestones please read our full proposal:\n\n[Proposal for Polkaevent](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ea4LU0Xo8hgtLlh7IJ6u9Q0PymhpJVGj6uidRRpXJbo/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "This proposal aims provide funding for the evangelists’ to operate their tasks and motivate them to contribute continuous effort to the Substrate developer community.\n\nOneblock plans to run a global Substrate evangelist Program to reach a broader group of audience, grow the Substrate developer community and push for the massive adoption of this technology, and at the end will further contribute to develop and grow the Polkadot ecosystem. This program will have a clear growth path and promotion mechanism to motivate the evangelists to contribute for the technology promotion and adoption.\n\nSubstrate has gained growing influence in China’s blockchain dev community in the past 24 months. Polkadot outperforms other new L1 chains as the second largest ecosystem in the size of active developers and it clearly has something to do with the continuous promotion and adoption of Substrate as a technology in China and global-wise. Oneblock views the necessity of doubling down the effort of promoting and adopting Substrate which directly contribute to the growth and thrive of the Polkadot ecosystem. Substrate Evangelist Program is a natural extension of Oneblock’s successful effort to promote Substrate and grow the Substrate developer community, from the perspectives of the influential coverage and the geographic market.\n\nTill Mar 5th,a total of 125 applicants come from China, Nigeria, Russia, Minsk, Ukraine, Solomon, Turkey, Togo, Iran, Morocco, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, America, etc 14 countries.\n\nOn April 9th,We hosted the Substrate Evangelist Program kickoff meeting and invited Dr. Radhakrishna @Web3foundation & Parity Asia Pacific Head @helenawang to join the panel and share the latest Polkadot news.\n\nIn the past April, May, and June, Substrate evangelists promoted Substrate ecosystem-related content.here you can get all the details [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14o481tQZBxGPr1xBZq-sSVt5HxzbNAItOFGXGt1SLCo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nPlease feel free to leave a comment!",

Reasoning behind the proposal, along with budget, a report on all child-bounties opened and roadmap can be found on their post below.**\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLink to the original discussion post: [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1159). \n\nWith this proposal we request a top-up to the [Anti-Scam Bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/11) to continue funding the community initiatives that aim to protect users in our ecosystem from falling victim to scams.\n\nThe bounty expanded on the previous community initiative targeting scam sites that was ongoing for several months, by adding new tasks that aim to create a holistic solution that addresses the problem from several aspects, while bringing awareness to the community, and educating users of both the problems and the efforts to address them.\n\nThe Task to find and take down scam sites is still the flagship of the bounty, taking the lion's share of the rewards, but several others of the tasks are being worked on with good progress and we aim to have all of them completed/active by the end of September 2022.\n\nAll the details of the proposal, along with spending analysis, can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JAtLuwzQjk5AejR_cxvMgz1xnWGwr90r2L34zBs1v8/edit). \n\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPLEASE NOTE YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE BENEFICIARY IDENTITY ON-CHAIN (this is the address of the bounty, created once the bounty proposal is accepted) BUT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CHECK THIS [ON SUBSCAN](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/13UVJyLnbVp9RBZYFwHYxa6GPKJ2SqkGg4Mo7jG7uLAbPkT8).\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/2tbzG3H/Screenshot-2022-07-18-at-15-17-31.png)",

      "title": "Talisman Proposal: Cross-Chain Transaction History Service",
      "content": "[Talisman](https://talisman.xyz) is a community-owned wallet that enables users to “traverse the Paraverse” with ease. We believe in a future where everyone has freedom via true agency over their intentions and finances, and we believe that DotSama will bring this to fruition. \n\nFor more on Talisman, please see the following talks from Polkadot Decoded 2022: Agyle’s [How Talisman is bringing multi-chain to the masses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7tZjVv70Jk), as well as Jonathan's [introduction to light clients in Talisman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaidhA5eL_8).\n\nToday, because of its early stage of development and complex multi-chain architecture, both Polkadot and Kusama are changing rapidly and the user experience (UX) can be confusing for end users. It’s our goal to solve that using user experience design and storytelling. We abstract away the complexity of underlying implementation and provide a friendly user experience when using DotSama and a way to discover new applications and services available to end users, while keeping them safe and educated about the actions they are taking.\n\nIn this proposal, we are seeking to fund development of a cross-chain transaction history service for the benefit of users, parachains and applications. We believe this will be an advancement in usability and security for end users, as they will be able to more easily understand the actions they have taken across different parachains in DotSama. Parachains and applications that have a presence across multiple parachains will also have an easier way to show users their relevant actions.\n\nWe regularly gather customer feedback as we work to uncover difficulties customers have with Talisman and within DotSama. Here are what some users have told us about the need for better cross-chain transaction visibility:\n\n- “Sometimes I don’t even know what assets I have. I do it the hard way, I have them all listed in p.js and I have to cycle through each of the projects to check my balances. When I check on sub.id everything loads, but sometimes locked tokens are missing. So I have to switch parachains, then visit each dapp to keep track.”\n- \"I would like to see my transaction history all in one place. This would be a huge help for example with my tax filings. Right now it's a real hassle.\"\n- “I want to be able to see multichain assets across multiple parachains.”\n\nPlease see the [full description here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/192asiQ13s4EAfXFFDFgKm_W3cqBVPPPxB5VNAig7keE/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThank you everyone who has commented during the [community feedback stage](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1152) of this proposal. We have corresponded with everyone that has provided comment.\n",

As a result, we developed a lot of internal tooling that could benefit peer substrate teams deploying zero-knowledge-proof techniques securely and quickly into their project. \n\n# Potential Applications\n- DID projects like KILT can leverage OpenZL to make their KYC/AML process more decentralized\n- Cross-chain Bridges can leverage OpenZL to make the bridges high-performance and trust-less\n- DAO tooling project can leverage OpenZL to build MACI for governance\n- Project like Astar can leverage OpenZL to build ZKRollups \n\nand many more\n\n# OpenZL Design\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/720571/167014503-10117012-c898-4d54-802a-966eb02dab98.svg)\n\nOpenZL is an open-source library that helps practioners (especially in Web3 space) to develop and deploy secure, high performance zero-knowledge proof code in production. It tries to bridge the gap between low level cryptographic primitives and devlopers' need to build scalable protocols using zero-knowlege proof cryptography securely and quickly. More specifically, many developers today want to leverage zero-knowledge proof systems to build powerful protocols like ZCash/Manta/ZKSync. However, they are facing two less than ideal choices; first, building a protocol using high-level languages like [Circom](https://docs.circom.io/) or [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/) loses many performance optimization opportunities, and second, building the protocol directly using libraries like [arkworks/groth16](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/groth16), [zk-garage/plonk](https://github.com/zk-garage/plonk), or [microsoft/nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) requires expertise in cryptography and can be very error-prone. Also, zero-knowledge proof systems are a moving target. There have been many new, and \"better\", proof systems coming out every 2-3 years ([BCTV](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/879.pdf) -> [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) -> [Plonk](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) -> [Nova](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/370)). OpenZL tries to solve this problem by building flexible, proof-system agnostic, and extensible libraries for Web3 practitioners.\n\nOpenZL consists of 3 parts:\n\n- Gadget libraries: a library of gadgets that developers can use as building blocks for their protocols. The initial range of the gadgets includes accumulators (merkle tree with zero-knowledge membership proof), zk-friendly hash functions (poseidon hash), and commitment schemes. The gadget libraries are programmed in eclair.\n- Embedded Circuit Language And Intermediate Representation (eclair): An embedded DSL in Rust that describes circuit logic. eclair leverages Rust's expressive type system to rule out certain classes of errors during the circuit construction.\n- Adaptors to Proof Systems: Adaptors that convert circuit logic in eclair to the constraint systems used in different proof systems. The initial supported proof systems are arkworks/groth16, zk-garage/plonk, and microsoft/nova.\n\n\n# Interested Users (alphabetical)\n* Acala\n* Astar\n* Interlay\n* Mangata \n* Jump Trading Crypto (at ZK Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-gayIFspno)\n* KILT\n* Talisman \n\n# Milestones, Deliveries and  Budgets\n\n## Oversight Committee\n\nOversight commitee will manage the overall execution and the financial budget of OpenZL:\n* **Shumo Chu** (Co-founder, Manta Network), DOT address: `15yUHnjUPumSZUWsAJuDgm794kLyCPFehXrFY4uFUt18jTnV`\n* **Luke Pearson** (Research Partner, Polychain Capital), DOT address: `14QPHeVLAvv5EU24mF4LBoqXFPmNg8MpNwsT9e1GSoEKW3Eh`\n* **Bryan Chen** (CTO, Acala Network), DOT address: `14DsLzVyTUTDMm2eP3czwPbH53KgqnQRp3CJJZS9GR7yxGDP`\n\nFunding and spendings will be managed in a 2/3 multisig:\n`15t6F3Ww4LHy6uw6vYqJzFzWSBqM2gLFDj3mzBFx8qzLeuH7`\n\n## OpenZL Milestones and Deliveries\n\n* Milestone 1 (Product):  Oct, 2022\n   * Code complete for all gadget libraries\n   * Code complete for `eclair`\n   * Code complete for `groth16` adaptor\n   * End-to-end example and test using `groth16` backend\n   * Spec complete for security audit \n* Milestone 2 (Audit): Nov. 2022\n  Potential auditors: ABDK, Least Authority, Trail of Bits\n  * Audit complete for all production level support code\n  * Substrate based tutorials\n  * Trusted-setup toolings \n\n## Project Budgets:\n*  **Developer salary**, `405,000 USD`, (4 cryptographic engineers * 6 months + 1 devop engineer * 0.5 month )  \n*  **Security audit**,  `600,000 USD`,  `40,000` LOC (currently, `manta-rs` has about 30,000 LOC) * `15 USD/LOC` (quote from [ABDK](https://www.abdk.consulting/)) |\n*  **CI/CD**,  `5,000 USD`,  CI/CD for OpenZL\n*  **Misc.** , `500 USD`, DNS, Website Hosting, etc \n\nTotal budget: 1,010,500 USD \n\nIn this proposal, we would like to ask from the milestone 1 funding, 400,500 USD development fund. According to the average DOT price of recent 30 days (https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price), this equals to \n53149.6 DOT (price 7.62 USD at July 10, 2022).\n\n## Budget and Execution\nAfter the completion of milestone 1, the oversight committee will evaluate the technical merits of the OpenZL and decide whether or not to release the fund to Manta Ray Lab (the dev company of Manta Network).\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal: Creation of an open-source KMS, a pool of shared nodes, and a block explorer for Polkadot",
      "content": "Dear Polkadot community,\n\nWe at Crypto APIs are building a robust auto-scalable B2B suite, providing blockchain- and crypto-related products as a service. With a team of 25 engineers, we have already successfully delivered our development tools to the communities of 12 of the largest blockchains. Now we are looking for a funding of 60,000 USD to build three tools that we will provide free of charge to the Polkadot community.\n\nAn open-source KMS (Key Management System). We will build an open-source SDK, which allows you to create blockchain-agnostic HD Omnibus wallets, derive addresses, prepare and sign transactions, etc. The private keys, xPriv, etc. (key management) are stored locally and not shared with anyone under any circumstances. Developers can use the other products of Crypto APIs for queries and transactions (read-only data and transact locally signed transactions) if they want to. However, there will be no vendor lock-in and the user can switch to another blockchain tooling and infrastructure provider anytime. This open-source product is an alternative to a paid business wallet, providing maximum independence and security to the user.\n\nA pool of shared public Polkadot nodes. The default and initial setup will be for 3 nodes. The more demand we have, the more nodes we will add. We will make sure that users always have their needs covered with industry-level response times. Crypto APIs will offer a free plan to the Polkadot community and to every organization planning to build on the Polkadot network. The nodes will have a Smart Load Balancer for improved efficiency and optimal response time. The shared Polkadot nodes will have a response time lower than 20 ms. The bandwidth will be set at 1 GB/sec. The nodes will be hosted on multiple clouds, utilizing the infrastructure of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Crypto APIs will also make sure that the shared RPC nodes are hosted in multiple regions, starting with the EU, USA, and Asia.\n\nBlock explorer. We want to provide a block explorer to the Polkadot community. We will integrate the Polkadot network into our Blockexplorer.One along with all other protocols that we support. Blockexplorer.One shows on-chain data only and it is completely free to use.\n\nYou can find the complete Spending Proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sllD_ly0Z0M5lID2NNc1tLolpB824WUO2oYTrb6bVrQ).\n\nWe would also like to share with you our [detailed Project Plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kM9L13iQsnnkfwSGdRVxOI1mVOd1k6vaFj6qf3OaoMg/edit?usp=sharing) for Polkadot with milestones, timeline, roles, and budget.\n\nThe funding will cover both the development costs and the infrastructure costs that will occur during development. Since we would need to run several nodes before starting the development, we expect a payment in two installments: 50% at the beginning and the other 50% after we successfully deliver all three products.\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and your thoughts on the project. Feel free to leave a comment below, or reach out via email. My email address is martin.hrisoskulov@cryptoapis.io",

The font will also come with a suite of variable iconography and cover both latin and cyrillic scripts. We aim to wrap this all up in a single file as a cutting edge variable font, offering both technical and design benefits.\n\nUnlike the Polkadot brand font that was designed for large sizes, this typeface will be built specifically for small size use across the Dotsama ecosystem. As an open source font our aim is that it has utility for users around the world.\n\n[Read full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KlK51o5JfTAwJQlv7AkZtv5FL5oKDtiUd5GOtKFT5GA/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)",

They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains added as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\nAll archives can be accessed and queried via an web intuitive GraphiQL interface and are often used as developer friendly replacement of a block explorer.\n\nOver the last 3 months (March, April, May 2022) we've provided a free public data indexing service for ~35 Substrate blockchains (some archives have been dismissed, new ones have been added), so that everyone interested in the projects can publicly access indexed data on Substrate Events, Extrinsics, Storage Items and EVM logs.\n\nBetween 2022-03-20 (when tracking has started) and 2022-05-06 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n\n- Served a total of 1,213,705,478 (1.2 billion) queries\n- The highest daily total was 394,214,930 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our 7 day average at the end of this period is over 25 million responses each day.\n- Kusama and Polkadot chains represent a very important share of the demanded data, with 10 and 2.8 million queries per week, respectively\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTM5hIviY0x_1YVeOD0QEw8uPvPHmFKNcAQrEwCQGSF7JuYAZuUCYo9dXrIfRnCQqVVH5tIMzCb1jjC/pubchart?oid=1449674255&format=image)\n\nThis proposal includes the combined costs for running Archives for Polkadot and its Parachains, which amounts to a total of  USD $16,044.40 - [raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RkNQ6-10u_nmmNy2Nkwi-i9EDXv6VwwLJw4DdJVx1pQ/).\n\n[Full text of the proposal can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTmxUAJivNHO4oMMdJY42c5UonPz_gIAN9PCqZpzGBdgu11ZzU_y0KCByzLkJZegG2gO_nJgw0Btc-K/pub)\n\nThank you for your consideration, Subsquid.io\n\n[Website](https://subsquid.io/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/subsquid) [Email](mailto:social@subsquid.io) [Github](https://github.com/subsquid/)",

      "content": "**Dear Dotsama community, and Councils,**\n\nThe crypto wallet is one of the key factors that determine the growth of a blockchain ecosystem. However, the Polkadot {.js} extension is [too complicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Polkadot/comments/r8bdw3/why_is_the_polkadotjs_wallet_so_complicated_to_use/) and [confusing](https://www.reddit.com/r/dot/comments/nuag6l/does_anyone_find_the_polkadotjs_app_too_confusing/) for end-users, especially those without a technical background. Other options are [few and far between](https://messari.io/article/state-of-polkadot-q1-2022?utm_source=twitter_nickgarcia&utm_medium=organic_social&utm_campaign=state_of_polkadot_q12022). Given that parachains are launching rapidly and XCM has come into effect, the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem needs a multi-functional wallet-friendly enough to onboard new users in the coming years, especially after the tipping point.\n\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/B1THH26yM-lThu2tjrWBWOgwQg_uNZzF_aj55B35mCaQ-0jwPTXZ6l8riCzxCBAsm9VcQ10-H28M8xr8tunGfezm=w640-h400-e365-rj-sc0x00ffffff)\n\nSubWallet aspires to become the pioneering user-friendly Web3 Multiverse Gateway for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. We envision a wallet in which Dotsama users can track, send, receive, stake, contribute to crowdloans and manage multi-chain assets with utmost ease. \n\n**Extension demo:**\n\n[SubWallet: Web3 Multiverse Gateway for Polkadot & Kusama Ecosystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrYsxVJsOR4)\n\n**Some tractions as of 15 June 2022**\n\n1. 60+ networks supported (relaychains, parachains & solochains) in the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem\n2. 5000+ organic installs and 4000+ active users on Chrome Store & Firefox Store.\n3. Conversation rate ~ 100%\n4. Our users come from 70+ countries. \n5. 5000+ community members on Twitter, Telegram, and Discord\n\n**These are the proposals for SubWallet’s Milestone 1 the full amount will be divided based on the milestones**\n\n1. Milestone 1: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C0ikxeAVEFm6MiskmtOrH1fZpo-3iwp_8RGFZxWriMo/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1) \n2. Community Discussion: [Link](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1113) \n\nWe would love to hear feedback/recommendations from the community and Councils. \n\n**All the best,**\n\n**SubWallet Team**",

It also allows NFT collection owners to set a [max number of items](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/11441). Finally, this release updates the deposits required to create both fungible and non-fungible asset classes to 10 DOT.",

      "content": "@Councillors, [**motion 220**](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/220) is now up for vote! Note this is a `batch` call for two treasuries proposals by the Ryabina/Web3Alert team:\n\n- [The first proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/136) aims to cover the completed development of web3alert.io: to provide Polkadot users with immediate access to on-chain data. Substrate integration allowing Polkadot and Kusama users to receive messages about on-chain events in Telegram and Discord messengers, totally customisable to the user’s needs. The proposal covers _only_ the Substrate module development (at councillors’ request). Deliverables, reasoning and budget can be found [HERE](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/136). \n\n- [The second proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/137), and since web3alert.io is up and running for the community to use, aims to cover the maintenance of the application for the next 6 months. Budget and items covered (codebase updates, servers maintenance and user support) can be found on [the post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/137). \n\nMake sure to review and vote at your convenience! The team is here to answer any questions!",

      "title": "Graded Assets & Fractional Uniques (Pallet Development)",
      "content": "**Requested Amount**: 2635 DOT = $ 27,300 @ EMA30 DOT Price=$ 10.359\n\n**Short description**: Development of two pallets in support of several use cases related to a gated marketplace for graded assets and fractional uniques (NFTs).\n\n**Detailed Proposal**: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUliCrFl-uTY8cIbOLhNoyBDvzm32UdoxIftGxJrUXI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUliCrFl-uTY8cIbOLhNoyBDvzm32UdoxIftGxJrUXI)\n\nAs more real-world assets continue to make their way to blockchain applications, there is an increasing need to ensure that the assets have been verified or graded by an expert third party/appraiser. This treasury proposal supports Substrate pallets that allow developers to launch a gated marketplace for graded assets that can be fractionalized in configurable quantities.\n\n## Graded Assets and Marketplace\n### Example Use Cases\n#### Coins and Cards\nSports memorabilia and historic or rare coins have long been collected as a hobby and store of value. Sports memorabilia alone is estimated at $5.4 Billion, but has a reputation for fakes. A common marketplace for these is eBay, and in their buying guide, they recommend having cards graded: \n\n> These independent organizations evaluate a card for authenticity and quality. Many use a 10-point grade scale. They then secure the card in a sealed, tamper-evident plastic holder complete with a certification tag, grade designation, and other pertinent card information. Graded cards command premium prices and allow collectors to buy and sell with confidence. \n\nThe grading organizations provide a physical representation of their certificate and grade embedded within a plastic holder, but these attestations lack digital verification and trust. \n\n#### Diamonds\nWe previously built a blockchain-powered, cooperative marketplace for diamonds. Since it is a complex process requiring a special skill set and instrumentation, and there is a high incentive for fraud, all diamonds must be graded by a community-approved grader (e.g. Gemological Institute of America or IGI). \n\nOnce graded, these diamonds are then purchased by the [Diamond Standard Company](https://diamondstandard.co/technology), where they are molded into pucks of equal value, stored in a secure vault, and minted on the Ethereum main net. See the [detailed proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUliCrFl-uTY8cIbOLhNoyBDvzm32UdoxIftGxJrUXI) for more details.\n\n#### Tax Credits\nIn many areas, tax credits offered by governments are transferable from the credit earner to other taxpayers interested in redeeming the credits. It is often the case that a credit may be earned by a person or company that does not have enough of a tax burden to leverage the credit. However, the validity of a tax credit requires an assessment from a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), lawyer, or other trained professional. \n\nThe grader must review a credit owner’s documentation and evidentiary materials to determine if in fact the credit will be honored by the taxing authority (government). \n\n### Pallet - Graded Assets and Marketplace\nThis pallet will support the selection and approval of graders, accounts that will perform asset verification or assessment on behalf of asset owners. Similar to the Identity pallet’s registrars, these parties may have a corresponding fee for their services, and the community’s trust in their attestation is secured by their reputation.\n\n#### Asset Redemption\nSome graded assets in our use cases also require a specific skill set or equipment for asset redemption. The pallet will also support this functionality, where again the redeemer pays a fee to a redemption specialist for the service.\n\nThe pallet will be compatible with the prebuilt Uniques pallet.\n\n## Fractional Uniques\n### Example Use Cases\nSome of the above mentioned use cases are fractionalizable, meaning a new asset may be spawned from an existing one and the new one inherits the attributes of the parent. Here are more details on these and other relevant use cases for this pallet.\n\n#### Commercial Leases\nWhen a commercial office space lease is signed, it becomes a future promise to pay the rent from the renter to the owner (landlord). This instrument can be sold or used as collateral for borrowing. The landlord may sell it shortly after executing it in order to receive capital immediately. It would be sold for less than the face value due to the risk and time-value-of-money. The difference between the sales price and the face value is the return awarded to the buyer.\n\nLeases are typically monthly, and each individual month is a separate future promise to pay. The leases can be fractionalized into monthly units where each one has a different value because the time to receipt is different.\n\n#### Cannabis Traceability and Regulation\nThe 'war on drugs' has failed, and cannabis legalization and regulation is sweeping free cultures around the world. In the United States, cannabis has remained prohibited at the federal level, and the regulation is happening at the state-level. Nearly all 50 states have some form of cannabis regulation, with the trend towards more support for allowing and taxing recreational cannabis.\n\nAlthough each state applies a bit of nuance to their specific rules, one rule remains consistent. All cannabis material must be closely tracked and accounted for. Growers purchase a bag of seeds, such as 100 seeds of a single strain. These are placed in water to germinate, where some will succeed and others will not. Of the successful ones, some are planted into a cube of potting soil substrate and others are frozen for safekeeping.\n\nThe cubed plants are grown to become \"mother plants\", where the yield, potency, and other traits are closely measured and monitored. These mother plants spawn clones and also flower that is dried and packaged. The flower is sold, often to a dispensary, where it is sold to the consumer.\n\nAt each of these steps, a new Universally-Unique-Identifier (UUID) is assigned to each unit, where its characteristics and weight are recorded. Test results, images, videos, PDFs, and other files or content can be attached to each UUID, and by default, each UUID inherits the parent's attributes. These attributes may also be overwritten, and/or uninheritable attributes may be added to each UUID.\n\nIn the context of the pallet, each UUID is a fractional unique. We are actively modeling this with [growers](http://nuponixlabs.com) in the state of New York, where recreational cannabis is legal and the details of licensing and regulations are actively being decided. We think a blockchain-enabled platform on Polkadot would be a compelling solution for more transparency and regulatory compliance in this fast growing industry.\n\n### Tax Credits\nTax credits are earned or created with a specific face value, determined by the taxing authority and corresponding asset grade. Buyers of the tax credit may not have a tax liability equivalent to the face value of the credit listed for sale. It is common practice for the owner to split the credit into a child asset in the precise amount desired by the buyer. \n\nSignaling even more interest in this space, in a [recent report](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/22/04/26859007/goldman-sachs-explores-nfts-in-the-context-of-financial-instruments), Goldman Sachs reported that they are “exploring NFTs in the context of financial instruments”.\n\n## Pallet - Fractional Uniques\nIn terms of data structure and functionality, tax credits, commercial leases, and cannabis units all can be modeled as fractional uniques/NFTs. \n\nEach use case requires:\n\n1. Attaching any various data elements or supporting materials (e.g. files)\n2. A parent-child relationship:\n- Each NFT starts as a root and supports spawning 0..n child NFTs.\n- Each child NFT inherits attributes and data from the parent, but may also override them.\n3. Numerical constraints may be applied to each NFT, for example: \n- Sum of all tax credit children must match the original face value of the root. \n- Sum of the weight of cannabis must be tracked and enforced, even what goes to \"scrap\". \n- Face value of a lease is the sum of its years, quarters, months, and weeks.\n\nJust like graded assets above, the pallet will be compatible with the prebuilt Uniques pallet.\n\n## User Interfaces\nWe will build polkadot-{js} style web user interfaces for all functionality. Since these components are general purpose, high fidelity screens and interfaces will be developed by individual use case projects and are beyond the scope of this proposal.\n\n## Documentation\nWe will provide detailed documentation, including step-by-step instructions, on how to use both pallets. \n\n## Milestones\nDetailed milestones and hours are included in the [detailed proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xUliCrFl-uTY8cIbOLhNoyBDvzm32UdoxIftGxJrUXI).\n### Phase 1\nUser on-boarding functionality for registering, configuring, and approving asset graders by an asset class. \n\n### Phase 2\nThis milestone is for developing the Fractionalizable Uniques pallet, including spawning, attribute inheritance, and hierarchical numeric constraints.\n\n### Phase 3\nThis milestone is for development of the marketplace and settlement processes, including listing for sale, accessing lineage/descendants and attributes, making offers and purchasing, accepting offers, and settlement with fees and commissions.",

This offline meetup will be held on June 28th Tuesday, 2022, and will include Web3 talks, featured panels with Klaytn(local Substrate Partner) along with Networking Party in the evening; provided by multiple parachains and Substrate Devs/partners in the Korean DotSama ecosystem.\n\nWe know some individual decoded 2022 speakers are from South Korea: indicating that there are local Polkadot ecosystem followers committed to community building, but unfortunately they can only be broadcast live online. But luckily Rhee, Polkadot Head Ambassador(East Asia), is also a core member of Phala Team: so we can take this opportunity to deepen the development of our local community and promote the Polkadot ecosystem by creating a relaxed atmosphere, where we can educate attendees about the latest developments on the ecosystem and the Web3 vision.\n\n[Link to the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1haXeB120uKwaP5x2EofEB_55WwAjXGXWkE5Tv6dcrps/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)",

This conference will be held during June 29-30, 2022, and will include two full days of talks, panels, and workshops on the most important topics for Polkadot in the last year and what is to come. The Polka Häus team will run the end-to-end organization (from the planning to the execution) of the Polkadot Decoded event in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe Polka Häus community was formed as a result of the Clubhouse audio app; it has since evolved into a diverse group of people with various levels of expertise participating in a multitude of activities hosted by the team on both digital platforms and real life. Today, the Polka Häus team captures community attention by sharing high level concepts and technical information within an approachable framework. This approach broadens the knowledge base within the community (and beyond it) in an inclusive way, as well as providing a valuable platform for Dotsama projects to reach an active community. The Polka Häus stage has been available to any team building anything of value in the ecosystem and we intend to carry that spirit forward.\n\n[Link to full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn__rw9n_gdCsICcb7GfgujuqBCf_b0BKI5xl2eQ4Ug/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

Our vision is to deliver 1 mn blockchain engineers, 1000 Startups and 10 mn retail traders with a continuity support program of education and certification in 1000 schools.\n\nThe first edition of International Blockchain Congress (IBC) held in August 2018 was a resounding success with over 5000+ attendees, out of which 200 represented the government. Conducted in 2 cities across 3 days, the conference attracted 300+ international delegates and 500+ hackathon participants. Receiving warm feedback from the government and the blockchain community, IBC media decided to continue with the conference on a much grander scale starting this year.\n\nThe second edition is bigger, better and will be game changing. Not only in terms of scale, IBC 2.0 will set benchmarks in the blockchain industry, raise the bar for attracting prospective investors for companies/ projects/ start-ups and bring in top line blockchain talent on a common platform.\n\nFind the link to the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_7lYIDN2a9vDcV20ho3sWySQRnBX6O7rvGeGroFyoDE)\n\nDOT price was calculated using the 30 day average of subscan [here](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n",

      "title": "Proposal for Educational Series at AIBC Americas Summit and Virtual Events",
      "content": "This proposal is for the first in a series of Web3 workshops delivered by SydTek DAO and Women in Blockchain Canada. The first session will take place at the AIBC Americas Summit on June 7th in Toronto, Canada, and will be delivered via a Web3 Masterclass by Dr. Justin Goldston and Justyna Osowska. The subsequent sessions will be delivered online at a later date within Bit.Country, a metaverse within the Polkadot ecosystem. In the event that live streaming will not be ready in Bit.Country, a contingency plan is in place to deliver the Blockchain 201 and 301 workshops in Cryptovoxels.\n\nThe purpose of these events are to get more people, namely more diverse users, within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, and we will initially target students within the higher education sector. In an effort to bring in more developers into the ecosystem, we look to market across the SydTek DAO, Women in Blockchain Canada, and the Polkadot (upon approval) social media platforms to bring more users into these workshops.\n\nAlso, to save on travel costs, the presentation below also includes travel expenses for an event at Georgetown University for Tranche Two where three members of the team will educate students and policymakers on Web3, blockchain, and Polkadot. As Dr. Goldston is a Graduate Advisory Board Member at Georgetown, he has been discussing blockchain and Web3 with Georgetown administration and policymakers in the United States as of late. With Georgetown ranked among the top universities globally in blockchain by Coindesk - https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2021/10/04/the-top-universities-for-blockchain-by-coindesk-2021 - the team feels this event has the potential to create a positive impact to the Polkadot ecosystem and the world.\n\nBelow is the presentation that outlines the two projects, the team members, and the agenda for the three events.\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E43gL-9LS1QwCBrk6D7P8iarvUOpJX8qvPZspj0AkAw/edit?usp=sharing\n\n**Updated Calculation 29 May 2022**\n\nProposal Value- $37,325.88 USD\n\nEMA30 - $11.628\n\nTotal Requested DOT- 3210\n\nThe proposal value was updated from $30,000 USD to begin planning and booking the travel for tranche two at Georgetown University as mentioned above.\n\n**Budget details can be found on slides 38 and 39 within the presentation above.\n**",

      "content": "My name is Sonal Banerjii. You can find me on riot as **@sb_ksm:matrix.org**.  I have been writing documentation and translating Polkadot and Kusama content for the Urdu speaking community. I’ve been awarded multiple tips for my efforts towards the community.\n\nAccording to the World Report on Disability  by WHO from 2011, the most marginalised people when it comes to education are not the poor but rather people with special disabilities. Particularly in the crypto space, these folks are being widely excluded from even providing them the basics of crypto education.\n\nIt’s our duty to include newcomers into this industry through educating them properly and while there will always be people that are not willing to put in the time, we’ve seen over and over again that there’s many that do want to learn more, but simply can’t find good educational sources to do so. \n\nSince Polkadot is one of the most used crypto platforms and we’re seeing so many folks getting acquainted with it, I believe opening up such a learning opportunity by teaching them just the basics would bring about a revolution in the crypto space.\n\nOur goal with this proposal is to create 30 educational videos geared towards people with special disabilities with a focus on explaining the basics. Based on my research with sign language interpreters as well teachers and other creators in this space, creating sign language based videos require a couple of people including:\n\n- Sign language interpreters\n- Conceptual content creators\n- Instructional designers\n- Visual story makers\n- Editors\n\nConnecting and getting all of these folks on board does require some funds and hence the need for this proposal. \n\nYou can take a look at the entire proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-GzRyrXL2CwVo-1tHTHluXy0y7v6LLTldNPC7SxJgIY/).\n\nSince we would get all the above mentioned creators on board, we wanted to make sure that they have the resources in place to create these videos. Hence, we are proposing a one-time payment for all the milestones.\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and get your thoughts around the project. Feel free to leave a comment below, or reach out via email, anytime.\n\nUpdated Calculation 24 May 2022\n\n**Proposal Value- $39,600**\n\n**7 day AVG- $10.03**\n\n**Total Requested DOT- 3948.15**\n\n\nUpdate : We have completed 80 percent of our videos that we mentioned in our proposal and we are conducting school workshop across different cities. We will be publishing our detailed report in the first week of April 2023. ",

On-chain [treasury proposal #113](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/113) - Requested amount: 5698.9 DOT\n\nTotal grant requested as in the proposal and as a sum of above: 6026.9 DOT - the team made a mistake on the first submission and this is the reason why two proposals are now up for vote. To ease the work of Council, I have combined them in one `batchAll` call. \n\nYou can find the contextual intormation of the proposal, with budget, success metrics and other requirements on the links above. \n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "**Proponent:** 12mRyiCp9zdh1wEVW5gLLiFBxDPKks72rRXmSupyEK3VAMLf\n\n**Date:** 6th May 2022\n\n**Requested DOT:** 7,404 DOT\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Polkadot, Statemint and Westend.\n\n**Raw Data:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhhzxTO8pC9tQMG12Uf8NnHZah6O_TIhMaerzsEBAVY/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (January, February, March 2022) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n- Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n- Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n- Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we’ve made GitHub issues based on behaviour we’ve observed)\n\n## Service Details\n\nThis last quarter has been huge for Polkadot and OnFinality, the demand for our services continues to be another  unprecedented period. January had a larger activity than the rest of the quarter which also had our highest daily Polkadot response count (for Q1)  of over 340 million responses in a single day. [Raw data is here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XhhzxTO8pC9tQMG12Uf8NnHZah6O_TIhMaerzsEBAVY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThis quarter was all about service stabilisation as part of the promise we made to this ecosystem to provide enterprise grade services to the community. Our services all exceeded our 99.9% target, with 99.99% uptime for Polkadot over the last 90 days. This is an important measure as we surpassed our largest ever day, with over a billion API responses processed by our service in a single 24 hour period in late January.\n\nYou’ll note that there was a significant increase in the amount of data egress over the previous quarter (55% growth to 110TB). We’ve been constantly scaling our nodes to meet this rising level of demand while maintaining our target 99.9% uptime (actual was 99.99%). We are currently working on new load balancing solutions to better route this traffic to different node types and expect that we will soon be able to handle more traffic with less resources.\n\nBetween 2022-01-01 and 2022-03-31 our Kusama API service has:\n\n- Served a total of 17,841,881,373 (17 billion) responses\n- Accumulated over 110 TB of data egress (up 44% on Q4, 2021)\n- The highest daily total was 340,585,751 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 201 million responses each day.\n- Westend had over 465  million API responses in the period\n- Statemint had over 302 million API responses in the period\n- All time totals for Polkadot is 1,919,138,536,720 (1.9 Trillion) since November, 2020\n- At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend was 99.99%, 99.98%, and 100%\n\n[The full proposal is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lgzqzhk4NFNLNbShfMlT4MbrIrhFFDNwlNCvD2Kt7mo/edit?usp=sharing)",

I meant to include this in [motion 191](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/191) but forgot. It should be enacted at a similar time to the enactment of the v9190 or later runtime upgrade. Two notes:\n\n1. The deposit is per one-way channel, so a bi-directional HRMP channel will require 2,000 DOT per parachain.\n2. Configuration changes can take a few sessions to take effect, depending on other pending changes in the parachains protocol. Therefore, parachains should wait until the new configuration takes effect before opening channels if they want to take advantage of the lower deposit.\n\n![preimage](https://i.imgur.com/P12Rv1H.png)",

On the runtime side, this release includes, among others, child bounties, and a PR enabling migration of slot depositors in crowdloan migration for parachains to be able to swap slots, among other things. \n\nFeel free to use srtool yourself to check the proposal hash. If passed by the Council, this proposal should be voted by the community and enacted after. Make sure to vote at your convenience!\n\n## Statemint\n\nStatemint v900 ([release notes](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v9.0.0)) marks the true launch of Statemint and its functionality. With audits having been complete for several months, the only thing Statemint needed was a way to get DOT from the Polkadot Relay onto Statemint. With the enabling of disputes and XCM on the Relay Chain as of v9190, this is now possible. The v900 release allows users of Statemint to teleport DOT from the Relay Chain, teleport it back, open HRMP channels, and perform all asset/NFT operations without restrictions.\n\nThis Statemint release also includes some minor Uniques pallet improvements in preparation for XCM V3, which will allow users and applications to use NFTs over XCM.\n\n## Call\n\n![preimage](https://i.imgur.com/UdvUEmX.png)\n\n![statemint auth](https://i.imgur.com/Wcmmg8m.png)",

      "content": "This proposal aims provide funding for the 2022 Summer Polkadot Hackathon by Oneblock in China - for operations and winners prizes.\n\nOneBlock, in collaboration with Parity Asia, successfully organized, operated and promoted the two Polkadot Hackathons in [March 2021](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/30) and [June 2021](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/62). OneBlock propose to continue the Polkadot Hackathon program in the year of 2022, an essential part of the Substrate promotion and adoption initiatives in China, to promote Substrate as an open-source framework for developers and convert the Substrate learners from OneBlock’s ongoing Substrate courses to Substrate builders. \n\nOneBlock, aligning with Parity Asia’s Substrate initiatives, plans to run two Polkadot hackathons in June 2022 (potentially along with Polkadot Decoded on June 29-June30 2022) and December 2022 (exact dates TBD). \n\nThe polkadot hackathon in 2021 was a success and it indeed helped to promote Substrate as an open-source framework for developers and convert the Substrate students from our ongoing Substrate courses to actually use Substrate to build projects. Receiving warm feedback from the developers, OneBlock decided to have 2022 polkadot hackathon and hereby submit this proposal for the necessary financial support on this event.\n\nhere and you can get all details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aGzWrQVfuWdAJND80bTxKi-u4htjjypGEtnDAWcJvBc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease feel free to comments!\n\n",

      "title": "User experience optimization and new function development of Subscan Multi-sig Tool",
      "content": "\n`Multisig` is an important module in the Substrate ecological network, which is of great significance for the fund management and permissions. It is widely integrated into the runtime by the networks that developed based on Substrate, and is gradually accepted and used by more users. Subscan multi-sig app is designed to help users create and manage multi-signature accounts and extrinsics. We keep working to provide users with a more convenient multi-signature tool, and will aim for this goal in the future.\n\nSince [the grant delivery](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/multisignature_management_tool_milestone_2.md) in Aug 2021, we have also fixed some disturbing bugs, and have been adding many new exciting features and enhancing UI/ UX for the multi-sig tool. The goal of this proposal is to seek funds for the new features developed for **Subscan multi-sig app** ([Github](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react)). \n\n**These new features are divided into 3 Milestones:**\n\n- **We have already completed Milestone 1 and 2**, and released (open sourced) it for anyone to use. Welcome to use and experience the [Subscan multisig tool](https://multisig.subscan.io/). \n\n- We sincerely welcome suggestions and feedbacks from the community to help us improve UX. **Over the next 3 months, we will complete Milestone 3 and add more community-requested features**.\n\n**More details can be found on Github:**\n\n- [Milestone 1: August-December 2021](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/milestone/1)\n- [Milestone 2: January-March 2022](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/milestone/2)\n- [Milestone 3: April-June 2022](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/milestone/3)\n\nIt can be seen that the number of commits is much more than Issues. Many small features are not recorded here, and the actual workload will be more.\n\nIn summary, our work focuses on two points:\n\n**- Make it more convenient for users to use multi-signature related functions.\n- Improve compatibility and facilitate more network integration.**\n\n\n**Here are some details of the main features:**\n\n- Custom endpoints for new network\nThe default support networks include Polkadot, Kusama, Darwinia, Crab and Pangolin. Users can now add custom substrate-based chain by configuring name, endpoint and explorer(optional).\nWith this function, we can now serve all networks with standard multisig modules, without the trouble to deploy another fork instance. Thus, it becomes a convenient facility in the Polkadot ecosystem, and users without coding experience can configure networks with ease.\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/subscan-explorer/treasury-proposals/master/multisig-treasury-proposal-2022-Aug//custom-endpoint.png)\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/78)\n\n- Historical multi-sig extrinsic indexing\nHistorical multi-sig extrinsics (including confirmed/cancelled ) are stored and indexed using SubQuery.  Accounts(member account + threshold) with extrinsic history will be stored as well. This is a prerequisite for importing multi-sig account from url.\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/subscan-explorer/treasury-proposals/master/multisig-treasury-proposal-2022-Aug/history-extrinsics.png)\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/88)\n\n- Import a multi-sig account (which has multi-sig extrinsic history) from url. (e.g. [https://multisig.subscan.io/account/1x8aa2N2Ar9SQweJv9vsuZn3WYDHu7gMQu1RePjZuBe33Hv#r%3Dwss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io](https://multisig.subscan.io/account/1x8aa2N2Ar9SQweJv9vsuZn3WYDHu7gMQu1RePjZuBe33Hv#r%3Dwss%3A%2F%2Frpc.polkadot.io)）\nWe know that a multi-signature account can be assembled and saved locally for the sent multi-signature extrinsic, according to the threshold and member accounts. Thus, when a user shares a url containing an endpoint and a multi-signature address, the corresponding threshold and member accounts are queried and saved locally for information viewing and further operations.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/137)\n\n- Import & export a multi-sig account through json file\nCreating a multi-sig account by manually input dozens of member accounts can be quite annoying. This feature can save us the trouble of doing so.\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/subscan-explorer/treasury-proposals/master/multisig-treasury-proposal-2022-Aug/export.png)\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/subscan-explorer/treasury-proposals/master/multisig-treasury-proposal-2022-Aug/import.png)\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/121)\n\n- Optimize the acquisition method of call data to adapt to more usage scenarios\nWhen a member initiate an extrinsic from other tools such as [polkadot.js/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer), the call data may not store on chain, and user can manually input the call data which will be verified correspondingly.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/61)\n\n- Compatible with metadata v14 upgrade\nSome related data structure have changed, such as call data stored on chain. We’ve made relevant adjustment to make it compatible with metadata v14 upgrade.\n\n**UI/UX improvement:**\n\n- Refine the general UI layout.\n- Show estimated reserve amount when submitting an extrinsic.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/84)\n\n- Optimize call data display in extrinsic list on account detail page.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/119)\n\n- Distinguish between cancelled extrinsic and confirmed extrinsic.\n- Add connection timeout message.\n- Optimize wallet list.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/148)\n\n- Show multi-sig account balance.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/94)\n\n- Improve performance and load speed.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/149)\n\nFuture plans:\n\n- Optimize network configuration architecture, support external chain submit RPC endpoint and subquery GraphQL endpoint configuration by PR.\n\n    We are committed to building multi-sig tools as an open, highly compatible infrastructure like the polkadot.js app. In order to achieve this goal, we still need to complete these tasks: [Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/157)\n\n    - Open source SubQuery schema/template so that external chain can deploy and host the node by themselves.\n    - Submit PR to include the RPC endpoint and subquery GraphQL endpoint into the menu.\n    - Automatically check the format and usability of PR (subsequent manual review will be carried out).\n    - Update README to provide instructions.\n\n\n- Batch import/export multi-sig accounts\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/138)\n- Deploy the SubQuery service for networks that have frequent  multi-sig extrinsics.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/151)\n- Simplify transfer operations.\nCurrently it requires user to select module and call to make transfer extrinsic. To make it easier, we plan to add a separate entrance for transfer.\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/subscan-explorer/treasury-proposals/master/multisig-treasury-proposal-2022-Aug/transfer.png)\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/136)\n\n- Add “favorite” and “share” multi-sig account features.\n[Issue & PR related](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/issues/143)\n- Add more community-requested features.\n- Add user education docs, videos, etc.\n\n\n---\n\n**Funding**\n\ndevelopment and maintenance cost:\n\n- [Milestone 1: August-December 2021](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/milestone/1): $32,100\n- [Milestone 2: January-March 2022](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/milestone/2): $35,800\n- [Milestone 3: April-June 2022](https://github.com/itering/subscan-multisig-react/milestone/3): $34,400\n\n**Total proposed amount: $102,300**\n\n---\n\n**Funding usage:**\n\nThe above-mentioned funds are used for the labor cost of subscan multi-signature tool milestone1-3 (9 months in total) development. Here is the detail:\n\n- Front-end development engineer: 1 full-time, 1 part-time\n- Product Manager: 1 part-time\n- Test Engineer: 1 part-time\n- UI & UX Designer: 1 part-time\n\nThe average monthly labor cost is **$11k**. Due to the different working hours of part-time staff each month, the funds applied for each milestone are also slightly different.\n\n---\n\n2022-04-21 06:04:54 (+UTC), Block #9967626\n\nDOT EMA30 Price ( USD ):  `19.389`\n\nNumber of DOT: `102,300 USD -> 5,276.305 DOT`\n\n[https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=102300&type=time&from=USD&to=DOT&time=1650522208](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=102300&type=time&from=USD&to=DOT&time=1650522208)\n\nPlease refer to the previous discussion: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/981\n",

      "content": "Hello Polkadot Treasury\n\n[RadiumBlock is an aspiring Web3 infrastructure service provider](https://radiumblock.com/) focused on the Dotsama ecosystem. We would like to submit a treasury proposal for the maintenance of radiumblock.com's [validator snapshot service](https://radiumblock.com/snapshots) for Q1 2022. The snapshot service provides both polkadot and kusama snapshots. The detailed proposal can be found [here](https://radiumblock.com/proposals/polkadot/2022/Polkadot_Snapshots_Q1_2022.pdf).\n\nAlthough this service benefits both Polkadot and Kusama communities, we believe that the amount is reasonable enough to request it from the Polkadot Treasury. We plan to alternate between Kusama and Polkadot treasury per quarter. \n\nVery much in the spirit of decentralization, we have explicitly tried to provide both geographical as well as infrastructure provider diversity. Here is a summary table of the snapshot providers and information about their infra and geographical we compiled(to the best of our knowledge).\n\nSnapshots | Infra Provider | Geo Location\n\nRadiumBlock.com | Hetzner | Finland\n\nPolkadots.io. | Google Cloud | US\n\nPolkachu.com | Digital Ocean | EU\n\nParasnaps.io | ? | ?\n\nBased on instructions we have adjusted the DOT amount to 100 DOT using todays DOT rate (EMA30) from https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price\nGiven the increased volatility we have seen the last few days we have slightly adjusted the slippage to 8%(vs 5% listed in our original proposal). \nWe request the payment to be made to our DOT wallet(same as the proposer address) 13GtCixw3EZARj52CVbKLrsAzyc7dmmYhDV6quS5yeVCfnh1\n\n\nWe welcome your feedback.\n\nThank you for your consideration!\n\nRadiumBlock\n\n",

I produce cryptocurrency content and tutorials for the Polkadot ecosystem on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/PauloZagoYT) channel, [Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/3WUO44czt7om3nbn45hARe) and [Articles](https://app.subsocial.network/5562).\n\nI started creating content on my YouTube channel on the 25th of July 2021 and I have already produced 23 videos about the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. \nI currently have a total of 23,990 views and 528 subscribers on my YouTube channel. \n\nDue to my dedication to contribute to the development of the Polkadot ecosystem, some Tips of my content were requested and endorsed for the Polkadot and Kusama council and I am currently the moderator of the Polkadot and Kusama Portuguese Telegram group.\n\nMy proposal is to create 36 educational contents during a period of 03 months with the frequency of 03 contents per week. These contents will be developed for the Polkadot ecosystem in 3 different media formats. Each content will be produced specifically for each graduate.\n\nI try to research and study the content produced around the world by the Polkadot community and translate it into Portuguese with a simple and easy to understand language to help beginner users.\n\n\n\nSee the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CwX86-WTrfOuKRDc33craMR93azh6AzRmjEdFOh1Gog/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nDiscussion page Polkassembly [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/956). \n\n[Tweet](https://twitter.com/paulo__zago/status/1506706392148844557?s=20&t=gk8UIo0cZw1lomLn2f3OPw) with community feedback\n\nFeel free to leave a feedback below. \nAll opinions are welcome.\n",

On the other hand, we will also follow up on the outstanding projects of the Polkadot ecology to keep everyone informed of the latest developments of the Polkadot ecology.\n\nPolkadot's success cannot be separated from the prosperity of the Polkadot Ecological Projects. Our goal is to make more people aware of Polkadot and also to make more people aware of the development of Polkadot ecology, which in turn will lead them to join in the participation and construction of Polkadot ecology, so that Polkadot and Polkadot ecology can flourish.\n\nSince September 2021, [we have established a Polkadot Treasury for our 2021/9-2022/2 operation cost, and get funding from the Polkadot Treasury](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19is5Ihn_0HEfOwUbsaDQzX7n89oRlWYwpt6eDWeabw0/edit). We have completed all the goals. [Please check our report to learn more.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNjxO6lPnA_fdtThuM3hgU1eM62irpEHOMVG6kgfwtY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSo this is a proposal for our six months operation cost. We apply approx 104,760.00 USD total allocation for 2022/3-2022/8 and [you can get all details here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mTWu_x7ULOKLz5Vmk2BMNj_THXFyXkDbKbpQRvKnBCw/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "content": "It’s time to celebrate!\n\nPolkadot Ambassador's program has grown significantly in a little less than a year (we are currently 2247 candidates and ambassadors according to the data provided on October 31, 2021) and our amazing community continues to grow. It is a fact that our Ambassadors have made an enormous contribution to the success of the Multichain future by educating our community about Polkadot technology, organising workshops and meetups, and pushing forward Web3 technologies for mass adoption.\n\nWe want to award each ambassador for the relevant work done which has made Polkadot a success. With these Ambassador’s badges, both in a physical form and as a NFT; we, the Ambassador’s community celebrate the success of the Polkadot Community and Network.\n\nFollowing the online PolkaOscar ceremony that took place online on December 28, 2021, we began minting and distributing ambassador’s NFT badges.Our original plan was to only post 3D badges to all ambassadors; but thanks to the Polkadot Decoded event in June we’ll have the opportunity to meet and hand some awards in person. We believe that taking the chance to host a physical PolkaOscar award ceremony will add spark to our movement.\n\nThe Polkadot Decoded event will take place in Berlin, Mexico City, New York, and Shanghai on June 29th & 30th 2022. Therefore, we will only post badges to those ambassadors who won’t be able to make it to the physical event. This way we will increase the chances that everyone will be awarded, and we will add a physical and virtual chapter to the wonderful history of our community.\n\nThe printing process must begin as soon as possible in order for the printing company to finalise 3d works, package the figurines and ship them to the event destination or to individuals on time for the event. About Polkadot Kings & Queens Characters: The very idea of ​​assembling and varying characters fits very well with the social story. Games like the Sims, where you collect a hero similar to yourself or Memoji from Apple, all works and plunges us somewhere into our childhood.\n\nAmbassador’s Badges are the characters made from cubes that you can assemble yourself, according to your taste and colour preferences. Your first badge can be the beginning of a regular collection - small and static, or something big and dynamic: games, cartoons, merch, the metaverse. This project is about personalities, anyone can find himself in a chelobrik and can build his own little cheloworld. Kusama Princes & Princesses and Polkadot Kings & Queens are a symbol of the Power of The Community and The Power of an Individual in this ecosystem. We are Decentralised but United by the ideal of building a new creative, decentralised and fairer world.\n\nLink to the proposal discussion [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/730)\nYou can find the proposal (with a breakdown of costs) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bTjb9CwnLnKbpQaHoASMJ9sTSee6eA22_yr5sADStmw/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "**Proponent:** NicholasHong/Tribe/StackUp `1FJCfJzPnuPTeSZnpwMetY5yZi56t2RRxvHsrAYkzwvfCFC`\n\n**Date:** March 2022\n\n**Overall Project Allocation:** $80,000 USD \n\n**Requested Allocation Through This Submission:** $50,000 USD *(covers first payment milestone -  phase 0 of this project - please see full proposal for more details - proposal link at the end of this post)*\n\n- DOT amount calculated via EMA on 11 Mar 2022 at GMT+0 1111hrs - 1 DOT ~ 18.135 USD. $50k USD ~ 2757 DOT\n\n**Short description:**\n\nReviewing Polkadot Hackathon: APAC Edition that took place in Quarter 4 2021, the organising team at AngelHack (a subsidiary of Tribe) identified gaps in the participants’ level of knowledge when attempting to learn Substrate, impacting the quality of the hackathon submissions received. By raising the number of quality of submissions, the Polkadot ecosystem can become even more vibrant.\n\nWith the series of 2022 hackathons planned by AngelHack together with Web3 Foundation, the team at Tribe aims to level up the participant’s prior knowledge of the Polkadot Ecosystem and fundamentals of Substrate pre-hackathon, in hopes to result in better submission quality.\n\nSpecifically, Tribe proposes to provide Learn-and-Earn campaigns to onboard global developers onto the Polkadot developer ecosystem, growing Polkadot’s active developer base with new developers that are equipped with strong foundational knowledge and hands-on development experience. Targeting 150 global developers to be onboarded through this engagement.\n\nThe Learn-and-Earn campaigns will be conducted through StackUp - Tribe's newest business offering - a platform that rewards developers with monetary incentives for completing tasks that level up their skills and knowledge. StackUp breaks the typical learning journey into smaller, bite-sized pieces (that we call quests), offering users real currency rewards for finishing each quest. This format of smaller exercises with incremental rewards, encourages learners to tackle more quests and learn more, as well as encourages them to follow through and finish the quest.\n\nFull Proposal Link: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NxH0-hxjttIXOxWgS0yURCpj2u2kJTCdT7gbFISqZSI/edit)",

      "title": "Polkadot Proposal: Lowering Nomination Intention Limits",
      "content": "This proposal is explained as suggested by Kian from the Staking team.\n\n**NOTE**: this proposal is using the new terminology introduced in [the February newsletters](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bisngPfte-P2vMuP_JrV6fIpNnd04uCWrqt4UbFklF8/edit#heading=h.kdyyexvr13fu), please refer to that for a recap.\n\nThis proposal aims to alter the limits on the nomination intention for Polkadot, namely lowering them since they are not strictly needed anymore.\n\nAs of release of runtime 9170, pallet-bags-list has been [fully enabled in Polkadot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bisngPfte-P2vMuP_JrV6fIpNnd04uCWrqt4UbFklF8/edit#heading=h.z30dvegsxvsi), and setting the intention to nominate should now be made possible for a larger audience. In essence, the number of intentions need no longer be bounded by 22,500. The bags-list will take care of picking up the top 22,500 nominations (those who become “electing”). Thus, we propose the following:\n\n1. Increase the number of possible intentions to **50,000**. \n\n**NOTE**: that this number could be lifted altogether, but we suggest keeping an upper bound that’s dynamically controlled by the governance as an extra safety measure, at least for the time being.\n\n2. Decrease the amount of stake needed to submit a nomination intention to **10 DOT**.\n\n**NOTE**: Similarly, this number could also be lowered back to 1 DOTs, which is the existential deposit, but we suggest doing that as a next step within the next few months, and for now keep this small limit to prevent a massive sudden influx of intentions. \n\nCall design:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RczyGyY/Screenshot-2022-03-09-at-09-57-10.png)\n\nEncoded call data: `0x071700e87648170000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000150c3000001b0040000015a00000000`\n\n**Urgency**: Ideally, this proposal should be enacted before the number of total nominators in Polkadot reaches 22,500 (the value for which at the time of this writing is 21,214). If it does, the ‘nominate’ transaction will become unavailable to all stakers. This proposal should have no negative effect on any stakers, as it will only relax the limits to submit for nomination intentions.\n\nLink to discussion post: [HERE](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/921).

      "content": "As many of you know, [Supercolony](https://supercolony.net/) requested funding from treasury to organize the **first Smart Contracts on Polkadot - WASM conference** and bring the community together to discuss this particular topic. The proposal was approved, after some discussions regarding budget and platform for online event, by [motion 152](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/152) a few days ago (more information on budget, milestones, roadmap and agenda can be found there). \n\nThe conference website can be visited [HERE](https://wasm-conference.com/). \n\nGiven recent events, and since the main organizers of the conference are located in Ukraine, they had to move from Kyiv for safety purposes. The holders of the beneficiary multisig for the proposal (`16PtCn76c7SB8mMDnuWsq5BjtaDetH8apZh5hRrHtLA3ce1W`) unfortunately lost access to the address while going away from Kyiv and have asked me what the alternatives to recover the funds, given they are still working to deliver the conference to the community.\n\nAfter discussion with the community regarding the two original alternatives to help save the funds, a third one and more viable was presented: to vote on a new treasury proposal with Supercolony's new account (the comment that originally suggested this can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/904#eeec650b-7afc-42c0-b7eb-3ffa6c9fe0ab)). \n\n- New address (with verified identity): [14QZaDL6Pj8TWdjoe2honAsoVKSytSc74rNcTZxfnJqSwaxc](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/14QZaDL6Pj8TWdjoe2honAsoVKSytSc74rNcTZxfnJqSwaxc).\n- Original discussion to help recover the funds can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/904).\n- The proposal aims to fund the **Smart Contracts on Polkadot - WASM conference (Virtual)**: the specs of the proposal, including budget, agenda, speakers and other elements can be found on [the original proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/152).**The old funds will be marked as \"Lost\" since they cannot be moved, and the account will be monitored**.

This release improves the block time degradation issues, as seen [on Kusama](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4911). It also includes new changes in the runtime: like optimised weights and contains the PR to fully enable the bags list on polkadot, which **removes the need of having a strict maximum count for nominators** and also fully alleviates the phantom nominator issue. Both of these are explained further [in the January issue of \"Polkadot Staking Progress”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12MPnxGzoiRcJJYAGOYVU8dGUkqybuhoQX7wg5ouGfgU/edit?usp=sharing).\n- Call hash for polkadot upgrade: `0x8eb2806cbdf1a4ba91334669b2476870134db3af5c77f418152af0ad354d3b32`\n \nThe **Statemint runtime** will be upgraded to [v700](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v7.0.0-rc8):\n\n-  The Uniques pallet includes an [extra storage item](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9940) linking class owners to their NFT classes. This storage map comes in handy for UI developers, especially around the UX of creating and minting NFTs.\n\n- With the inclusion of [Polkadot 4470](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/4470) and [Cumulus 831](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/831), parachains that have HRMP channels with Statemint will finally be able to use them in both directions. For parachain developers, note that this is a breaking change and if you've used reserve backed transfers from Statemint then you will need to migrate some storage items.\n\n- It addresses all issues found by independent auditors regarding the Statemint runtimes. For Statemint, this means that once teleportation is ready (pending some final disputes related features) it should be OK to lift the call filter restricting asset/unique creation, opening the door for fungible and non-fungible assets in the Polkadot network.\n\nAs usual, the Statemint proposal will dispatch an `authorizeUpgrade` message. All info about the upgrade can be found on the link above.\n\n- Hash for XCM call (council motion) can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BvnGFDK2KVjvFNMxs6qA9evkeSyniOdS/view?usp=sharing).\n- Hash: `0x8adb4ccdf996f05fa7941ce3b56ecec6dd49a88d9db445963e813ac10cadd326`.\n- Encoded call: `0x01028adb4ccdf996f05fa7941ce3b56ecec6dd49a88d9db445963e813ac10cadd326`\n- Runtime release can be found [HERE](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/parachains-v7.0.0-rc8).\n\nFeel free to use srtool yourself to check the proposal hash. If passed by the Council, this proposal should be voted by the community and enacted after. Make sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "This new proposal aims to enact the same as [motion 157](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/157): to temporarily increase the nomination limit to `160` DOTs. This allows for the permissionless `chill_other` transaction to be used and prune the number of nominators, in order to keep the nomination ecosystem of Polkadot active, whilst we wait for the enactment of the next runtime upgrade on Polkadot.\n\nThe enacted proposal unfortunately contained a major flaw: the numerical values are not in DOTs, but rather in PLANKs, the smallest unit of the DOT currency. Thus, the correct value for minimum nominator bond should have been set to `160 * (10^10)`, i.e. `1600,000,000,000`.\n \nAll values are unchanged except for `minNominatorBond`.\n\nThe correct call hash and data:\n\n- Call data: `0x071700806e877401000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e457000001b0040000015a`\n\n- Call hash: `0xbdf1c925dbca9e1e55de029db3786ea71949ff872e5b53588f46d0db6ccae379`",

      "title": "The Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot Network from Sep 2021 to Dec 2021.",
      "content": "\nSubscan is an aggregated Blockchain explorer for Substrate-based chains. We have supported several chains:\n\n- Relay chain: Polkadot, Kusama\n- Testnet: Westend, Rococo\n- Public parachain: Statemine\n\nWe not just provide basic explorer services for the above networks, and develop new features, optimize the ux and fix bugs as always.\nPlease refer to the version update document:\n> https://medium.com/subscan\n\nOver the past few months，We have seen an encouraging trend in the number of users and their level of activity. However, with the rapid growth of users, stability and reliability in infrastructure are becoming a challenge. As a result, Subscan has to expend more resources to ensure the quality of the service. \n\nActually, Subscan is starting to generate some revenue, which mainly comes from the development fee and O&M fee to support the new network. As our original supporters, Parity/W3F helped a lot in the early stage of Subscan. We don't want to charge the team a high premium O&M fee to gain profits, instead we will do more development and research to provide better explorer services to repay the ecosyetem. Therefore, we decided to only apply the necessary infrastructure costs as O&M fees, and the rest of the cost such as human resources and development will on the subscan team. We look forward to growing rapidly and taking on more and more responsibilities.\n\n## Current Service Scale of Subscan\n\nBelow are some metrics from Cloudflare and Subscan's monitoring system for the last few weeks.\n\n*Subscan traffic overview:*\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/subscan-cloudflare.png)\n\n*Subscan API traffic and distribution:*\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/subscan-qps-per-network.png)\n\n\n\n## Billing Info\n\nThe infrastructure cost refers to what we have spent on Google Cloud Platform.\n\n### September 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/09_2021.jpeg)\n\nSubtotal in September: $9,370.69\n\n### October 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/10_2021.jpeg)\n\nSubtotal in October: $8,495.50\n\n### November 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/11_2021.jpeg)\n\nSubtotal in November: $10,057.64\n\n### December 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/12_2021.jpeg)\n\nSubtotal in December: $10,349.90\n\n\n### Total Amount\n\n**$9,370.69 + $8,495.50 + $10,057.64 + $10,349.90 = $38,273.73**\n\n*Compute Engine*, *Cloud Logging*, and *Cloud SQL* are the three primary services, among which *Compute Engine* alone constitutes around **75%** of the total cost. Detailed billing info and other relevant proof are available upon request.\n\nThe estimated infrastructure cost we spent on Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, and Rococo adds up to **$28,705** according to the request distribution chart. Therefore, the amount we are requesting is **1483 DOT**.\n> 1 DOT ≈ 19.355 $USD (EMA 30: 2022-02-24 08:33:42)\n\n\n## References\n\n- Subscan for Polkadot Network: https://polkadot.subscan.io/\n- Subscan Service Status: https://subscan.statuspage.io/\n\nThe source code of this proposal is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/blob/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-Sep-to-Dec/).\n",

      "title": "Cloudflare Enterprise Plan for Subscan from January 2022 to April 2022",
      "content": "## About Subscan\n\nSubscan is an aggregate high-precision blockchain explorer for Substrate-based chains. We have been supporting several influential blockchains, including Polkadot, Kusama, Rococo, and Westend. For many users, Subscan is their first stop in the blockchain world. As we continue to deliver new features and support more blockchains, our user base is on the steady rise. Therefore, high robustness and availability are currently among our major concerns.\n\n\n\n## About the previous proposal\n\nIn the [previous proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/60), we explained **Why We Can't Do Without a Firewall?**\nand **Why We Need the Cloudflare Enterprise Plan?**\n\nWe greatly appreciate the support from Polkadot Treasury and all the community members, Subscan has integrated with Cloudflare Enterprise since August 16th, the enterprise plan really helps us reduce the service latencies significantly. It has been working smoothly for the past 6 months, with no noticeable Cloudflare incidents up to now.\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2022-Jan-to-Apr/cloudflare-data.png)\n\n\nThe previous proposal was for advance payment, now I am here to update the whereabouts of the money. Although Subscan has integrated with Cloudflare Enterprise since August 16th, due to trial and commissioning, the first two months are free and the formal payments began on October 15. The invoice is as follows:\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2022-Jan-to-Apr/cloudflare-invoice-10.png)\n\n\n\n## Total Amount\n\nThis time we apply for the fee from January 15, 2022 to April 14, 2022, and the invoice is as follows:\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2022-Jan-to-Apr/cloudflare-invoice-01.png)\n\n\n\nThis proposal is for Subscan's Cloudflare enterprise plan (mid-January to mid-April), the Cloudflare enterprise service fee is **$15,300**. \n\nIn the last proposal, we applied for 100% of the cost of Cloudflare enterprise service. As Subscan grows, we will strive to cover more and more costs. This time, we decided to reduce the application proportion to 85%, and it will be less and less in the future until complete financial independence.\n\nTherefore,  the amount we are requesting is :\n\n**15,300 * 85% = 13,005 $USD**\n\n**1 DOT ≈ 19.355 $USD (EMA 30: 2022-02-24 08:33:42)**\n\n**13,005/19.355 ≈ 671 DOT**\n\nIn case we missed any information or you have any questions, please feel free to send us an inquiry.\n\n## References\n\n- Cloudflare Enterprise plan: <https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/>\n- Cloudflare Argo: <https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/>\n\nThe source code of this proposal is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/tree/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2022-Jan-to-Apr).\n",

We would like to further integrate with Polkassembly and add some improvements based on user feedback as well as integrate Tips and child-bounties mechanism. More details about the planned scope can be found in the description of each milestone.\n\nProject Link : [https://treasury.bright.dev](https://treasury.bright.dev)\nLink to any documentation already published: [https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury](https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury)\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\nThe first development phase of this project was funded by the Web3.0 Foundation Grants Program. Currently, BrightTreasury maintenance is funded by Treasury funds and is available in the production environment at https://bright.treasury.dev. \n\n**The Team behind it**\n\nBright Inventions is a team of 70 developers, project managers, UX/UI designers and operations specialists - experts in mobile and web applications, systems integration, IOT devices and Blockchain platforms. \n\nWe believe that building a software product is about people working together in a collective way. By offering complex support – mobile and web development as well as IT consultancy we try to eliminate roadblocks towards engaging clients as partners at every step of the process. \n\nWe support startups, digital agencies as well as medium to big businesses. We cooperate with startups, accelerators and incubators. Whatever the client profile is, we always  aim to establish a satisfying partnership for both sides. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide.\n\nThe BrightTreasury team currently consists of:\n\nAgnieszka Olszewska - Technical Lead, blockchain specialist. \nShe is a senior backend developer with a main interest in data modeling. She started her software development career 10 years ago and from then she began discovering a lot of new technologies. Among them there are JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Postgres, Node.js, NestJS. Most recently she’s been engaged in developing blockchain based solutions with Substrate.\n\nAlisa Kashytska - UI/UX design\nShe is a UI/UX designer with a passion for digging deep into the product domain and understanding the user's perspective. She has worked on the design for multiple web/mobile solutions and lately has been responsible for UI redesign of Parity Building Blocks Android and web apps.\n\nŁukasz Kuderewski - fullstack developer\nHe is an optimist, always willing to learn new things. Mechatronics engineer who fell in love with programming. He has always been interested in a holistic approach to programming problems, which is why after working as a frontend, he is now fulfilled as a fullstack.\n\nRobert Koprowski - fullstack developer, blockchain specialist\nHe is an experienced and ambitious blockchain enthusiast. Graduated from the University of Edinburgh, he lived in various locations around the world to settle now in Gdańsk. Originally a Backend Developer who decided to extend his skills and become Fullstack Developer, always trying to learn something new.\n\nKatarzyna Łukasiewicz - Project Manager\nShe has been working with agile methods for over 10 years, both as a researcher and a practitioner. She believes in teamwork and a power of user centered mindset. With experience in leading international projects, she knows how to support and encourage timely and high quality deliveries.\n\n**Costs and budget**\n\nThe total cost is a sum of budgets for the four milestones.\n\nThe cost covers all necessary development, design and management efforts performed by the team introduced in the \"Team behind it\". \n\nAfter each milestone a summary of what has been accomplished along with a link to documentation and guidelines how to test will be posted in the Discussion of the proposal.\n\n**Milestones**\n\nMilestone 1 - Add proposals’ and bounties’ description and title to Polkassembly  \nDates: 2022-02-28 to 2022-02-28  \nCost: 393.4 DOT  \nCurrently BrightTreasury displays the Proposal and Bounty information that were added through Polkassembly. The goal of this milestone is to support the flow other way around. We want to allow users to share to Polkassembly the Proposal or Bounty contextual information they add via BrightTreasury. Whenever a user converts an Idea to Proposal or adds a new Bounty using BrightTreasury, she/he will be asked if they want to share the description to Polkassembly as well. If the user agrees, she/he will need to confirm the identity and the description will be shared automatically. There will also be the possibility to do it later. \nIt will include the following user stories:\n\n- US.1 Ask user if description can be shared to Polkassembly\n- US.2 User identity confirmation \n- US.3 Convert BrightTreasury structure to Polkassembly structure (+ information “This proposal was added through BrightTreasury. For more info & discussion, check BrightTreasury link...”)\n- US.4 Preview Polkassembly post (no editing) \n\nMilestone 2 - Improvements & change requests  \nDates: 2022-03-14 to 2022-04-03  \nCost: 936.68 DOT  \nWithin this milestone we would like to present the users with a set of smaller features that were suggested to us in the testing phase of the app. They should improve the overall user experience and engage the community in discussions. \nIt will include the following user stories:\n\n- US.5 Import blockchain identity context info & add blockchain avatar for all types of accounts \n- US.6 Deleting own account by the user \n- US.7 Tagging users in the discussions (+search/filter users) \n- In-app notifications\n- Mail notifications\n- US.8 Add reactions for comments in discussions (thumbs up & down) \n- US.9 Add markdown interpretation for description fields (Ideas/Proposals/Bounties) with preview \n- US.10 Password reminder/recovery \n\nMilestone 3 - Implementation of child-bounties  \nDates: 2022-04-03 to 2022-05-02  \nCost: 1064.75 DOT  \nIn this milestone we want to integrate the new child-bounties pallet in BrightTreasury Bounties module.\nIt will include the following use stories:\n\n- U.S. 11 As a curator I can create a child-bounty within a curated active bounty.\n- U.S. 12 As a curator I can share child-bounty description to Polkassembly\n- U.S, 13 As an anonymous user I can view the child-bounties list\n- U.S. 14 As an anonymous user I can view the child-bounty details\n- U.S. 15 As a curator I can propose a child-bounty curator and his fee\n- U.S. 16 As a child-bounty curator I can accept the nomination\n- U.S. 17 As a child-bounty curator I can reject the nomination\n- U.S. 18 As a parent-bounty curator I can unassign the child-bounty curator (and slash his deposit)\n- U.S. 19 As a curator I can edit the contextual info of a child-bounty (title, description, people who do the work) and report progress.\n- U.S. 20 As a child-bounty curator I can award a chosen beneficiary for the child-bounty\n- U.S. 21 As a bounty or child-bounty curator I can claim the payout of the child-bounty (the reserved amount will be paid out to the beneficiary account)\n- U.S. 22 As a bounty or child-bounty curator I can close an active or added child-bounty\n- U.S. 23 As a user, I can view the details of closed child-bounties (only for Polkadot and Kusama networks)\n- U.S. 24 As an anonymous user I can see the parent-bounty value left\n- U.S. 25 As a logged-in user I can discuss the child-bounty \n- U.S. 26 As a child-bounty owner I can get the discussion email and in-app notifications\n- U.S. 27 As a user taking part in discussion I get the email and in-app notifications\n\nMilestone 4 - Add Tips mechanism  \nDates: 2022-05-02 to 2022-05-23  \nCost: 891.71 DOT  \nThe main goal of this milestone is to integrate the Tips funding mechanism to BrightTreasury, in a similar manner as Proposals and Bounties. Users will be able to browse through tips, introduce a new one or support an already added tip. Tips module will also include Polkassembly integration - two way sharing of the contextual information.\nIt will include the following user stories:\n\n- US.28 As a logged-in user I can create a tip request \n- US.29 As an anonymous user I can see the on-chain tips list\n- US.30 As an anonymous user I can filter the tips by the status\n- US.31 As an anonymous user I can see the on-chain tips details\n- US.32 As an anonymous user I can see the polkassembly tips details\n- US.33 As a tip owner I can share tip details to polkassembly\n- US.34 As an anonymous user I can see the tippings list  \n- US.35 As a logged-in user I can discuss the tip \n- US.36 As a tip owner I can get the discussion email and in-app notifications\n- US.37 As a user taking part in discussion I get the email and in-app notifications \n- US.38 As a tip owner (in-app owner, finder) I can claim the tip pay out\n- US.39 As a tip owner (in-app owner, finder) I can cancel the tip\n- US.40 As an anonymous user I can view the tips history (list, details, discussion)  \n\nLink to this proposal info & discussion in BrightTreasury app: [https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/93/info?networkId=polkadot](https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/93/info?networkId=polkadot)\n\n\n",

      "content": "This is a short term upgrade proposed to increase the limit of DOTs for nomination from 120 DOTs to 160, maintaining the increase of 40 DOTs that the network has had throughout this period of updating the nominator limit through governance. The reason for this is the combination of the following:\n\n- Polkadot’s [0.9.16](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/releases/tag/v0.9.16) upgrade was scheduled to contain a fix that would completely remove the 120 DOTs limit. This explained thoroughly in the monthly staking report of [January 2022](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376#january-2022). After the 0.9.16 update, the nomination limit would move to a dynamic system based on demand, rather than a fixed entry barrier.  \n- Due to some unforeseen issues arisen after the deployment of 0.9.16 in Kusama, 0/9.16  has not yet been proposed to Polkadot.\n- In the meantime, the number of nominators in Polkadot has been increased to reach the 22500 limit. \n\nAs a consequence, we propose to temporarily increase the nomination limit to **160** DOTs. This allows for the permissionless `chill_other` transaction to be used and prune the number of nominators, in order to keep the nomination ecosystem of Polkadot active, whilst we wait for the enactment of runtime 0.9.16 on Polkadot.\n\n Proposal details: All values are unchanged except for `minNominatorBond`.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/vz2vcdj/Screenshot-2022-02-21-at-18-31-17.png)\n\n- Call hash: `0xb2286cbfdd18c265572d3305754b0dbe8ba1fd8da40ef48ff0d5ef40912f2291`\n\n- Call data: `0x0717a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e457000001b0040000015a`\n\nPreimage is submitted.

      "title": "Anti-Scam Bounty ",
      "content": "## Purpose of the bounty\n\nScams are plaguing our ecosystem, as they do the entire industry. However, as a community, we have shown time and again that we take scams seriously and strive to create a safe ecosystem for users.\n\nThis bounty proposal aims to incentivise the community, both individuals and companies, to fight against scams and protect users from falling for them. We believe that anti-scam response should be a community endeavour and this is what this proposal aims to build.\n\nThis proposal expands on the [community initiative targeting scam sites](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2iXCCvdkQ70WrfDPtG5uQA3RrCfvb0VDlZjti26q0yb17sg/viewform?pli=1) that has been ongoing for several months now with high levels of success. However, the current initiative is focused only on scam sites, while overlooking other aspects of scam fighting where we could be doing more.\n\nWith this proposal we aim to create a holistic solution that addresses the problem from several aspects, while bringing awareness to the community, and educating users, of both the problems and the efforts to address them. The bounty for this proposal is meant to be open-ended, with the funds being distributed through child bounties that cover several aspects of the anti-scam response.\n\nThe tasks described in the child bounties utilise mostly off-chain tools and processes, but it is the goal of this initiative to evolve to bring as much of that as possible on-chain. These tasks came from feedback from the community and the experience garnered from the current initiative.\n\nThe child bounties will be opened gradually as potential implementers come forward, and more will almost certainly be added along the way. They are described in this proposal with varying levels of details, but all parameters of each child bounty, in terms of implementation, participation and rewards, will be defined in detail before the child bounty is opened.\n\nAnd because this is an evolving process, changes to the bounties are almost certain as we gain more experience and get more feedback from the community. But the three main evolution goals of this initiative are:\n\n- To move it on-chain as much as possible\n\n- To have it being driven and coordinated exclusively by the community\n\n- To become an anti-scam umbrella over the broader Polkadot ecosystem, covering parachains, other relay chains and projects\n\nFinally, all rewards are subject to change as we evaluate the efforts needed, receive feedback from implementers, curators and the community at large, and in case the price of DOT is very low or very high for prolonged periods of time.\n\nDetails on the proposed child bounties and rewards can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V-39ktdgpvATPpV1cfI8iZlS8_3oBDAHdlcMDd_3jpo/edit).",

      "content": "***Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Polkadot, Statemint and Westend. Posted here for any discussion before moving to a Treasury Proposal***\n\nOver the last 3 months (October, November, December 2021) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend nodes.\n\nBetween 2021-10-01 and 2021-12-31 our Polkadot API service has:\n- Served an unprecedented total of 23,897,857,938 (23 billion) responses (an increase of 334% on the previous quarter)\n- Accumulated over 71 TB of data egress (up 313% on Q3)\n- The highest daily total was 515,417,945 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 227 million responses each day.\n- Westend had over 377 million API responses in the period\n- Statemint had over 295 million API responses in the period\n- All time totals for Polkadot is 35,146,213,629 (35 Billion) since November\n\n![Q4 Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSRvBZAOy2Zz2F5FygZHdSHFFGbdpvka9rz_zLzdz0JDaTBZVkrlX1FdnA4tIUjroW0-pms0Q06N-YN/pubchart?oid=1506257754&format=image)\n\nThis last quarter was huge for Polkadot and OnFinality, the demand for our services was unprecedented. In early November we experienced a surge of activity coinciding with the announcement of the Polkadot Parachain Auctions that took us to our highest daily response count of over 515 million responses in a single day.\n\nTowards the end of this period we also noticed additional load on the compute component of our resourcing that we believe is due to the first 5 parachains connecting to the main relay chain and the additional block verification that resulted. We scaled up the compute component of our infrastructure to maintain service levels as a result. Additionally we are closely watching the work that Dwellir is doing in the ecosystem to propose improvements to the RPC nodes.\n\nAdditionally, our experience shows significant performance improvements in terms of response times when the CPU usage is less than 50%. We observed a noticeable drop of service quality (in terms of response times) when the node is under load.\n\nThis proposal includes combined running costs for our infrastructure for Polkadot, Statemint, and Westend. The total combined running cost is USD $101,122.20\n\n[The full writeup is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UjcKMwoUOLrbFjBU_5HVofR6nQ-yDQ8wE7yPLB2AN_M/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "The bounty proposal, an incentive prize program called the **Polkadot Pioneers Prize**, aims to structure a series of challenges created with the goal of propelling technical innovation on the Polkadot network. The first two of those challenges will be announced later this year and will cover categories including **zero-knowledge research** and **Polkadot infrastructure improvements**. The expectation is also for the bounty to provide the Polkadot ecosystem with an influx of new talent.\n\nThe incentive prize program will be structured as a set of [child bounties](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10309) (to be included in the next runtime upgrade upon community approval), the details of which will be communicated in the second or third quarter of 2022 and will be decided by the general curator: to be elected by this Council. Due to the new design of the child bounties pallet, we can earmark funding now and announce the upcoming program, and then the elected curator can divide bounty payouts within the prize categories based on the sub-prizes and elect child bounty curators, which will be determined before the program launch. \n\nPlease note this is the first stage for the bounty: if approved by the Council and after the bounty status is marked as active, the Council will elect a bounty curator -  the proposal includes a suggestion to Council for this role as well (a multisig composed by a group of community members). \n\n**Reasoning behind the idea, requested allocation, categories and further suggestions can be reviewed on [the Polkassembly post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/10)**. \n\nCouncillors: please vote at your convenience!",

We are a mission driven validator with the goal of promoting more extensive adoption of privacy and zkp tech in the blockchain space.\n\nThe proposal would use €8000 in DOT from the treasury to fund the event. The full proposal is viewable through the link [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qKy8-dGO8w2GUMDW6qiEalhB0iTUKJsYBYUErnOx28w/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1). The key points and motivation for the profile are as follows:\n\n- Privacy is a blocker to more extensive adoption of blockchain technology.\n- Hosting an event raises awareness of the importance of privacy on Polkadot and encourages discussion in this subject area.\n- An event also provides a platform for networking - new connections can be made and ideas shared.\n- We previously hosted a privacy focused workshop for Polkadot in the Summer of 2019, the write up is here and a virtual event in April 2021, with the recordings of the event viewable here. We hope that you will support our proposal and welcome any feedback.\n\nThank you for your consideration!",

For more info & discussion, check [BrightTreasury](https://stage.treasury.bright.dev/proposals/85?networkId=polkadot)**\n\n## About the project\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to fund the Bright Treasury app maintenance costs. We have automated tests and deployment of infrastructure templates with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). The infrastructure as code approach lets us have an easy run and update of the environment.\n\nProject Link : [https://treasury.bright.dev](https://treasury.bright.dev)\nLink to any documentation already published: https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n",

      "content": "This treasury proposal is Between the Polkadot Council and MIDLDEV OÜ, a company registered in Estonia with registry number 14973249, commonly known as MIDL.dev.\n\n## Service description\n\n- A functioning infrastructure to provide usable blockchain database snapshots for the Polkadot network, to the benefit of node operators and validators,\n\n- New snapshots at least once per day. Snapshots are filesystem dumps of the Polkadot node storage backend files, of variety RocksDb, of type pruned, with a depth of 1000 blocks, compressed in 7z format, that can be used by validators to quickly spin up or restore their infrastructure,\n\n- A website frontend at polkashots.io with relevant metadata and download links, including a permanent link that always redirects to the most recent snapshot,\n\n- Best effort incident and problem management,\n\n- Redundant implementation setup which allows for continuity, seamless upgrades and basic disaster recovery & contingency management.\n\n## Context\n\nNode operators must have a contingency plan for loss of storage. For us at MIDL.dev, it consists of regularly taking snapshots of the node filesystem and backing it up for recovery if needed. We regularly generate these archives for our own benefit as well as the community. All cloud automation code used for generation of snapshots is [open-source](https://github.com/midl-dev/polkadot-snapshot-generator) so node operators can easily replicate the setup in order to be in full control of the generated snapshots.\n\nThe website polkashots.io has been operational for a year now. It has had excellent uptime. It is very frequently mentioned in the Validator Lounge Matrix channels and there are youtube videos referencing them. It is beneficial to the ecosystem by providing a path for validators to quickly and safely recover from a storage failure or migrate their operations.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe warp sync feature has been implemented in Polkadot 0.9.9, however it still requires several hours for a full sync.\n\nA unique snapshot service that many independent validators relies on constitues a centralization risk. It remains our hope that other ecosystem participants will step in and offer an alternative service.\n\n## Operational expenses\n\nThe labor cost is 1200 EUR/month including 2 engineers in 2 geographical locations (Western US and Western Europe).\n\nIn addition, we pass along the cloud costs with a 50% markup.\n\nPolkashots is hosted on google cloud. Google cloud has the concept of \"projects\" which allows for segregation of costs. The cloud cost is determined as follows:\n\n- from June 1 to October 10, 2021, polkashots was hosted in a google cloud project shared with other MIDL.dev services named \"MIDLUS\" for which we estimate about 30% of the costs were incurred by generation and download of Polkadot snapshots.\n\n- from October 11, 2021 to November 30, 2021, we moved polkashots to a dedicated google cloud project named \"MIDLPS\", allowing for the most precise cost calculation. We arbitrarily allocate 50% of these costs to Polkadot and 50% to Kusama. A dedicated project for each network would incur overhead costs that we do not feel are necessary.\n\nA majority of these costs are network egress. Google cloud egress costs are in the higher range, similar to Azure and Amazon. Google cloud has two tiers, premium ($0.12/Gb for most regions) and standard ($0.85/Gb for most regions). The premium tier is using google private network across the globe. Polkashots uses the premium tier.\n\nThe costs have gone upwards after the introduction of parachains. This is due to the increased storage requirement of the relay chain node in the presence of parachains: as of this writing, a pruned polkadot node with 1000 blocks uses 18Gi of storage (7z compressed). In other terms, it costs the treasury $2 each time someone downloads a Polkadot snapshot. We expect this cost to go up again soon as more parachain slots become active.\n\nThe usage of the best cloud platform money can buy is justified by the benefits: a faster download speed and better reliability means that the nodes are more apt to recover quickly in case of accidental loss of storage, making the entire network more resilient.\n\nScreenshots of the billing console are attached for reference.\n\n## Usage\n\nFrom the MIDLPS billing screenshot, we can see 17,262 Gibibytes of download from the period Oct 10-Nov 31 from all regions excluding Asia and Australia. Polkadot snapshot size is 17Gi and Kusama snapshot size is 50Gi, so assuming a medium download file size of 34Gi, there were 500 downloads during the period, or 10 downloads per day. This is a combined figure for Polkadot and Kusama networks.\n\n## Note\n\nThis proposal is for the Polkadot portion of polkashots. We already submitted a [similar proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/412) to the Kusama council, who accepted it.\n\n## Budget\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/rb2GC2j/Screenshot-2021-12-30-at-07-43-05.png)\n\nMore info on usage can be found on [THIS LINK](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/80).",

Specifically, Aura uses sr25519 keys to sign blocks, but the keys in the genesis chain spec were generated using ed25519.\n\nA new runtime was created as a temporary fix. This runtime enables ed25519 in Aura for Statemint. This will be enacted on the Relay Chain so that validators will be able to validate the collator signatures.

Reports will live as free resources on Messari and distributed through our newsletter (~200k subscribers) and various social channels.\n\nWe are requesting $125k payable in DOT with a 10% premium to account for market volatility. This will go towards funding an initial \"ecosystem report\" and then 4 quarterly reports to provide more ongoing coverage.\n\nYou can find further details in the [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mkurr4HK0UEiI4aDs6bDWYM7CwycKW8tTHA95dotwcU/edit#).",

The second will authorize the upgrade to Statemint. Both calls need to be constructed on Shell and then dispatched from the Relay Chain in an XCM.\n\nSee the [release notes](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/releases/tag/statemint-v6.0.1) to review the assets, reproduce the `set_storage` call, and generate the runtime.\n\n## Shell Constructions\n\n### Set Storage\n\nThe `set_storage` call can be generated with the `build-spec` command from a collator node, using `statemint_genesis.json` as input.

Authorize Upgrade\n\nThis message authorizes the upgrade of Shell to a runtime with a given hash (statemint_runtime-v601.compact.compressed.wasm). Once the upgrade is authorized, anyone can submit the runtime via `parachain_system.enact_authorized_upgrade`, and it will upgrade 600 blocks (approximately 1 hour) later.\n\nCall data: `0x0103af49687b93d91fc08c1fcea1001d724a95c533a949019645d3e4179beedbf67e`\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rHrTJRx.png)\n\n## Polkadot Proposal\n\nThis proposal is to schedule these messages to dispatch from Polkadot to Shell. They will dispatch 5 and 20 blocks after enactment to ensure each is processed separately. We give them plenty of weight (100 billion and 1 billion, respectively) to ensure they execute.\n\nCall hash: `0xa6830793b6a3473f66fbd7305a9e330dd2dd688df0e8fcbd0c9ff08d28040a34`\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/5D8syF9.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YmVC8o3.png)\n",

      "content": "**Proponent**: 1ndvErzA6F2gHFXwEqjcPd7qtGnsZDiStpSj4A8LytDJRhf\n\n**Date**: 24.11.2021\n\n**Short description**: This proposal is focused on increasing the Polkadot Spanish community with the development of an Educational Hub for Spanish community and ambassadors.\n\nAs ambassadors we need information about the Polkadot ecosystem, we have been searching and translating documentation to participate in events since last year. We also notice requests for this kind of information in social networks, official and unofficial chats, frequently. We have seen the limitations of English communication in the community. The complexity of the protocols and the ecosystem requires additional information and an easy way to explain the system.\n\nTo solve the necessity of the community, we believe that it is important to explain the ecosystem in an easy way, and in Spanish, to give tools to the community to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nAs we know, some people are working on tutorials, translations, or blog posts but there is not an integrated, compiled, and organized information system for this community, and we aim to establish one for the Spanish and Latin American communities.\n\nWe consider that development of the Spanish community (Spanish language) should be through different actions and activities, building content in communication channels:\n\na.- **COMPLETED** - Development of a Spanish community Polkadot webpage.\n\n**Milestone 2 (covered by this proposal) includes:**\n\nb.- Guidelines and Tutorials about Polkadot Ecosystem.\n\nc.- Spanish content as blog posts, guidelines, papers and more about Polkadot.\n\ne.- Translations of Polkadot Wiki and official documents and research of important information in the ecosystem.\n\nFor milestones, budget, and reasoning behind Milestone 2 of this proposal please visit [THIS DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj95yKquBI_qzoejMvljfmShqLvoE8p6S0gDwGt2-nY/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1).\n\nPlease note:\n\n- This allocation covers Milestone 2 of the original proposal\n- DOT Rate: 39,43 USD/DOT (24.11.2021) based on subcan EMA30 tool\n- Allocation: 494.35 DOTs\n- The team will follow up with a report on development.",

      "title": "Treasury Proposal - CryptoLab Staking Website (milestone 2&3)",
      "content": "**Short description**\n\nThe [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.network/) aims to help non-technical nominators build stable and risk-controlled cash flows via well-designed and financial tools. The core idea is that we want to make staking the same as an investment. Therefore, we help nominators to build good portfolios and to manage their portfolios to control risk and revenue. Portfolio management is challenging in Polkadot/Kusama system because they are NPoS consensus.\n\nWe design the CryptoLab website to help users to do their cryptocurrency financial management. Our goal is to make staking comprehensive to people who may not be yet familiar with blockchain, from basic wordings to data representation. We plan to provide the following features in this stage,\n\n- Portfolio Benchmark\n\n- Portfolio Management\n\nPortfolio Benchmark helps nominators to evaluate which validators they should stake on. They can simply choose and nominate from our pre-built strategies or set their conditions on different criteria to get a list of validators. And it is just the first step.\n\nThe real difference that makes CryptoLab outstanding is Portfolio Management. We want to help nominators track their revenue and suggest new sets of validators according to the criteria they set. In addition, we want to maintain nominators make adjustments in time to prevent profit loss by notifying them when a validator increased its commission or when a validator is being slashed.\n\nThe CryptoLab staking website supports both Polkadot and Kusama networks. Please note that this proposal is only for milestone 1 on Kusama. We will submit the milestone 2 & 3 to the Polkadot Treasury once we finish the milestone 1.\n\nPlease look at our [full proposal](https://github.com/cryptolab-network/cryptolab-staking-treasury-proposal) for more detailed information. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nAfter completing milestone one and launching the CryptoLab Staking website, the team submitted the second and final treasury proposal to achieve the website.\n\n- The report for milestone one can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/97#c6d6a68b-4b23-4580-8cdb-71e9faf6b51e).\n- Please see the details of the 2nd and 3rd milestones on the [full proposal](https://github.com/cryptolab-network/cryptolab-staking-treasury-proposal).\n- This second proposal also includes another half the operating costs (3000 USD) to maintain the website on AWS.\n- The total amount would be 14,250 (2nd) + 7,500 (3rd) + 3,000 (operation) = 24,750 USD\n- DOT rate: 43.39 USD based on EMA30 by Subscan on 11.24.2021",

      "content": "**Proponent**: 12WarfbFeUm5L9Fs5zkTaQQH7L5hqaGPEgM9vQ1UFK8kiUSK\n\n**Date**: 03 Nov 2021\n\n**Requested allocation**:  ~$25,000 (in three installments).\n\n**Short description**: Although Ethereum is a much less complicated system, google ‘books on Ethereum’, then google ‘books on Polkadot’. You’ll notice that while there are more than 10 books on Ethereum, Polkadot (the network) has nothing. Of course, this is more a sign of age than anything, but I’m proposing a way to start our journey.\n\nThis proposal brings to light the lack of a holistic and easy-to-understand explanation of Polkadot in a book form. It outlines the importance of a book and proposes a solution to create one. But not just another book about blockchains but one focused on Polkadot and written from a totally non-technical perspective.\n\nPlease visit [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NT6BzM8nOcbXR7wD1C2IJlsi0XyeJaS5Hv50Wy4rJ0/edit) to read the full proposal\n\nA first draft has already been drafted (90% finished).

This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we've made Github issues based on behaviour we've observed)\n\n### Service Details\n\nBetween 2021-07-01 and 2021-09-30 our Polkadot API service has:\n\n-   Served an unprecedented total of 5,506,995,252 (5.5 billion) requests\n-   Accumulated almost 17 TB of data egress\n-   The highest daily total was 87,529,840 requests in a single 24 hour period\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 70 million requests each day.\n-   Westend had over 96 million API requests in the period\n-   All time totals for Kusama is 11,181,846,891 (11 Billion) since November\n\nNote: We have implemented custom middleware in our platform that counts and logs these requests, [you can view the raw data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IpvVytzsaekxm8EmvWXsxrdq2AF1di7Q9O9rWHoraFM/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/lSOA6TwTODWmplqAKLeg2CvB-RCT2ANpwQiQcVVyAsZe98NOyAflbV-qYEixrrWVdLZcN-tmlliKPh51L4nOUkomq0pF6t6XWc0DI_jJDkxhUB9qMlnOic0wWMEy6zLMRZoXpBee=s0 \"Chart\")\n\n### Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements (on our own cost) that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   An improved dashboard for our partners so that they can monitor usage and manage the upgrades of the nodes in real time.\n-   Collection of a rich set of metrics and usage data that is securely shared with partners to help them scale and develop their network.\n-   Improvements to our routing strategies and scale enhancements to our load balancer with the goal of scaling to a Billion daily requests.\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is met.\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to every parachain team at launch\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/).\n\nWe continue to reaffirm our dedication to providing free support of 500,000 requests to our API service each day for users around the world. You can access our public API service by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer) or via the endpoints listed below. You can also [create your own free API key in our application](https://app.onfinality.io) and track metrics and statistics.\n\n-   https://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public\n-   wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws\n-   https://westend.api.onfinality.io/public\n-   wss://westend.api.onfinality.io/public-ws\n\n[**You can read more details about this proposal, including detailed traffic and costings here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SeXDFuhF3W5R0W7W86KEhQAKnGKQ75o-tBSsxyRi2ro/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "Proposal for First Parachain Auctions on Polkadot\n\nThis is a proposal to schedule the first set of parachain auctions on Polkadot as well as get\nCouncil buy-in to a recommended strategy for scheduling auctions on a 3-6 month basis.\n\nBased on the performance of parachains on Kusama and the state of audits, the Parity engineering\nteam believes that the code for parachains, auctions, and crowdloans is ready for an initial\nproduction release.\n\nThis motion proposes two batches of auctions:\n\n- The first: five auctions, starting 11 Nov, seven days each, beginning every _seven_ days, for\n  lease periods 6-13 (LP6 is slated to begin 15 Dec)\n- The second: six auctions, starting 23 Dec, seven days each, beginning every _14_ days, for\n  lease periods 7-14 (LP7 is slated to begin 09 Mar 2022)\n\nAs auctions can take place prior to a lease period starting, this motion schedules auctions to\nbegin around mid-day (UTC) of 11 November.\n\nIn order to ensure stability guarantees, I suggest along with this proposal that the Council and\nnetwork governance limit the number of parachain slots on Polkadot to 75% of that on Kusama. This\ninitial schedule will last until early March; as the network grows the Council can suggest an\nupdated auction cadence to stay within a reasonable factor of safety relative to the number of\nparachains on Kusama.\n",

      "content": "**Treasury request**\n\nKlever all in one Cryptocurrency Wallet is proposing to expand into the Polkadot ecosystem. We have already included Kusama. We now continue with Polkadot inclusion. The objective of this post is to request treasury funding for Klever team to include Polkadot in the Klever Wallet. This proposal will focus only on Polkadot at this time.\n\n\n**Intro to Klever**\n\nKlever is a crypto wallet ecosystem serving over 2.5 million users worldwide and over 500k monthly active users on Klever App, Klever Swap, and Klever OS. Klever currently has a staff complement of 50 developers and a 24-hour support team with approximately 20 additional employees. Klever App is a simple, powerful, and secure self-custody crypto wallet, supporting the world’s major blockchains. The app offers 300+ trading pairs in Klever Swap and access to ETH and TRX-based DApps in Klever Browser. Klever is supporting over 190 countries and 30 different languages at this stage.The Klever App provides the following functionality\n\n- Multi-cryptowallet : supports basic features like hold, send, receive, transaction history and balance. Currently supports 10 blockchains that includes BTC, ETH, TRX, XRP & LTC. Klever is actively adding more blockchains\n- Multi-Platform : support both iOS and Android. Available in the respective stores for download\n- Staking feature : stake on your favourite project and earn passive income\n- Swap : convert coins just in one click.\n- Buy : support to buy crypto with credit card and apple pay\n- Browser : ability to use website/dapps and allow the mobile wallet to interact with dapps directly. Confirm spend like one would do in metamask. Essentially Metamask in your hands\n- Security : Klever utilizes the latest military-grade technology for encryption.

You’ll notice that while there are more than 10 books on Ethereum, Polkadot (the network) has nothing. Of course, this is more a sign of age than anything, but I’m proposing a way to start our journey.\n\nThis proposal brings to light the lack of a holistic and easy-to-understand explanation of Polkadot in a book form. It outlines the importance of a book and proposes a solution to create one. But not just another book about blockchains but one focused on Polkadot and written from a totally non-technical perspective.\n\nPlease visit this [link to read the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11NT6BzM8nOcbXR7wD1C2IJlsi0XyeJaS5Hv50Wy4rJ0/edit#)\n\n**A first draft has already been drafted** (90% finished).

Therefore, it is important that current and future users have access to information about Polkadot-JS’ full functionalities to manage their account operations independently.\n\n[Guide to Polkadot-JS](https://anaelleltd.github.io/polkadotjs-guide/) provides step-by-step instructions for Polkadot-JS Extension and Apps, but it needs to be redesigned and updated to provide a better browsing and educational experience. This proposal is to request funding for these improvement and maintenance items.\n\n\n**Payment conditions:** This proposal covers funding for the following costs:\n1)\tUX and UI improvements (Milestones 1 & 2).\n2)\tOngoing Maintenance for September, October, and November 2021 (Milestone 3).\n\nThe total DOT allocation for this proposal was calculated using the [30-day average rate tool](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) by Subscan on the day of on-chain submission.\n\n\nYou can find the full proposal (including links to all milestones) [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpfMQfrkd8eJ1BVwur4uz8fm-JIlhs5pGqSx8y283ZU/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\nThank you! :)\n",

      "title": "The Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot Network from June 2021 to August 2021",
      "content": "> Past discussions: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/610\n](url)\n\nSubscan is an aggregated Blockchain explorer for Substrate-based chains. We have supported several chains, such as Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, and Rococo, for more than one year. We have seen an encouraging trend in the number of users and their level of activity. However, with the rapid growth of users, stability and reliability in infrastructure are becoming a challenge. As a result, Subscan has to expend more resources to ensure the quality of the service.\n\nIn the long run, we foresee Subscan is being a financially independent service. Although Subscan is starting to generate some revenue, it currently falls short of supporting the infrastructure costs. Therefore, we are looking for financial support from Polkadot Treasury to help to continue providing a realiable explorer service to the community.\n\n## Current Service Scale of Subscan\n\nBelow are some metrics from Cloudflare and Subscan's monitoring system for the last few weeks.\n\n*Subscan traffic overview:*\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/subscan-cloudflare.png)\n\n*Subscan API traffic and distribution:*\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/subscan-qps-per-network.png)\n\nAs the charts demonstrate, Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, and Rococo are the major user traffic of Subscan. This request-per-second value is showing a decreasing trend from ~80% the last time we submitted the proposal to ~70% currently.\n\nWe also launched the [service status page](https://subscan.statuspage.io/) in the last few months. In order to improve the transparency of the Subscan service, several core metrics of our backend have been published on it. Any user in the community is able to watch the incidents, scheduled maintenances, real-time request success rate, service response time graph, etc.\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/subscan-statuspage-metrics.png)\n\n## Billing Info\n\nThe infrastructure cost refers to what we have spent on Google Cloud Platform.\n\n### June 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/cost-table-june.png)\n\nSubtotal in June: $7,384.03\n\n### July 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/cost-table-july.png)\n\nSubtotal in July: $7,865.29\n\n### August 2021\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/cost-table-august.png)\n\nSubtotal in August: $8,643.68\n\n### Total Amount\n\n`$7,384.03 + $7,865.29 + $8,643.68 = $23,893`\n\n*Compute Engine*, *Cloud Logging*, and *Cloud SQL* are the three primary services, among which *Compute Engine* alone `constitutes around 70%` of the total cost. Detailed billing info and other relevant proof are available upon request.\n\nThe estimated infrastructure cost we spent on Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, and Rococo adds up to `$16,725` according to the request distribution chart. Therefore, the amount we are requesting is `568 DOT (1 DOT ≈ 29.40 $USD)`. Such support is indispensable for our goal to capitalize on economies of scale.\n\n## References\n\n- Subscan for Polkadot Network: https://polkadot.subscan.io/\n- Subscan Service Status: https://subscan.statuspage.io/\n\nThe source code of this proposal is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/blob/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-june-to-august/).",

      "content": "**Proponent**: 1ndvErzA6F2gHFXwEqjcPd7qtGnsZDiStpSj4A8LytDJRhf\n\n**Date**: 14.09.2021\n\n**Short description**: This proposal is focused on increasing the Polkadot Spanish community with the development of an Educational Hub for Spanish community and ambassadors. \n\nAs ambassadors we need information about the Polkadot ecosystem, we have been searching and translating documentation to participate in events since last year. We also notice requests for this kind of information in social networks, official and unofficial chats, frequently. We have seen the limitations of English communication in the community. The complexity of the protocols and the ecosystem requires additional information and an easy way to explain the system.\n\nTo solve the necessity of the community, we believe that it is important to explain the ecosystem in an easy way, and in Spanish, to give tools to the community to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nAs we know, some people are working on tutorials, translations, or blog posts but there is not an integrated, compiled, and organized information system for this community, and we aim to establish one for the Spanish and Latin American communities. \n\nWe consider that development of the Spanish community (Spanish language) should be through different actions and activities, building content in communication channels:\n\na.- Development of a Spanish community Polkadot webpage.\n\nb.- Guidelines and Tutorials about Polkadot Ecosystem.\n\nc.- Spanish content as blog posts, guidelines, papers and more about Polkadot.\n\ne.- Translations of Polkadot and Kusama Wiki and official documents and research of important\ninformation in the ecosystem.\n\nWe are considering creating a website integrated by video tutorials, translations, official information, blog and news. All to increase the Spanish Community engagement. \n\nWe have taken into consideration community  and council feedback and we will include into the proposal:\n\n1.- Section to add to the website a submissions form: to submit article / video / tutorial to be published on the website \n\n2.- Information related with validators and staking.\n\n3.- For the third part we could create a space to learn and develop the languages applicable to the DOT, including Rust. \n\nFor milestones, budget, wireframes and reasoning behind the proposal please visit [THIS DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vj95yKquBI_qzoejMvljfmShqLvoE8p6S0gDwGt2-nY/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease note:\n\n- this proposal covers the first part of development subsequent parts will be submitted onchain after council review and evaluation of development report. \n\n- DOT rate calculated based on [30 day avg tool by subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).",

      "title": "Increasing nominators’ min bond on Polkadot",
      "content": "The staking team requested a new proposal to increase the minimum bond and allow new nominators above the threshold to participate in the network’s security mechanism. As mentioned by the Staking team on [this message](https://matrix.to/#/!FdCojkeGzZLSEoiecf:web3.foundation/$YNsqfhHKXoRbW_QKvtG5EKn8HodUGFts6abJJdSAoVA?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), Polkadot currently has 22500 nominators and the configuration of the staking system prevents further nominators to join.\n\nThe team suggests to update the staking parameters: The proposal has the goal to increase the minimum bond to allow new nominators above the threshold to participate in the network’s security mechanism, and for less staked nominators to be chilled. **Note that after the latest runtime upgrade (9090), existing nominators can always update their preference at all conditions.**\n\nThe proposal the team suggested aims to change the staking parameters to allow more nominators with higher backing stake be able to join the staking system. The existing parameters as follows:\n\n- Minimum validator bond: None\n- Maximum validator count: `1200`\n- Minimum nominator bond: `80` DOT\n- Maximum nominator count: `22500`\n- Chill threshold: 90%\n\nThe new proposed parameters aim to update one value:\n\n- New minimum nominator bond: `120` DOTs\n\nThe team aims to increase the limit enough so that we won't need to do another tweak for at least a month. **Multiple tracks of optimization are ongoing by the development team**, and you can read more about them on this [issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9511). Furthermore, a monthly progress report will be released [here](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/aa835946455b9a3f167821b9d05ba376) to communicate the technical details. Please note that increasing the value of the parameter to **120 DOTs** will hopefully give the team another more time until the new threshold is reached and we have made progress on a more permanent solution. Please leave your comments and feedback on the proposal. Keep in mind these measure is **temporary**, and the overall goal is the stability and security of the network.\n\n- Preimage [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10FRH_Hzs8kqwI_lfMZhC6bu6Dt0bQdCf/view?usp=sharing) - submitted.\n- Hash: `0xb862a50c4e8541c013637e9766f3059af75218f0f9630dc8b6c85dc8f633a971`\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

On the other hand, we will also follow up on the outstanding projects of the Polkadot ecology to keep everyone informed of the latest developments of the Polkadot ecology.\n\nPolkadot's success cannot be separated from the prosperity of the Polkadot Ecological Projects. Our goal is to make more people aware of Polkadot and also to make more people aware of the development of Polkadot ecology, which in turn will lead them to join in the participation and construction of Polkadot ecology, so that Polkadot and Polkadot ecology can flourish.\n\nSince June 2021, we have established a Polkadot Treasury for our June/July/August operation cost, and get funding from the Polkadot Treasury. We have completed all the goals in June and July. Please check [our report for June and July](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xrIybVA7QH9MCzZs7nZyXNQleKRBc4k4ZVsabUFf6qM/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more. \n\nSo this is a proposal for our six months operation cost. We apply approx 86,250.00 USD total allocation for 2021/9-2022/2 while DOT=23.514 USD (DOT rate calculation using 30 day avg rate tool from Subscan [here](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) )and you can get all details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19is5Ihn_0HEfOwUbsaDQzX7n89oRlWYwpt6eDWeabw0/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Increasing nominators’ minimum bond on Polkadot",
      "content": "As mentioned by the Staking team on [this message](https://matrix.to/#/!FdCojkeGzZLSEoiecf:web3.foundation/$YNsqfhHKXoRbW_QKvtG5EKn8HodUGFts6abJJdSAoVA?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), Polkadot currently has 22500 nominators and the configuration of the staking system prevents further nominators to join. \n\nThe team suggests to update the staking parameters as soon as the next runtime upgrade happens today. The proposal has the goal to increase the minimum bond to allow new nominators above the threshold to participate in the network’s security mechanism, and for less staked nominators to be chilled. Note that after 9080, the existing nominators can always update their preference at all conditions. \n\nThe proposal the team suggested will change the staking parameters to allow more nominators with higher backing stake be able to join the staking system. The existing parameters as as follows:\n\n* minimum validator bond: None\n* maximum validator count: `1200`\n* minimum nominator bond: `40` DOTs\n* maximum nominator count: `22500`\n\n**The new proposed parameters will update one value:**\n* new minimum nominator bond: `80` DOTs\n\nand set a new parameter that did not existed before:\n* chill-threshold: 90%\n\nThe reasoning behind the new minimum nominator bond: Polkadot onboards ~150 nominators per day. That means if the network has 4500 empty slots, they will be filled in 30 days. The team aims to increase the limit enough so that we won't need to do another tweak for at least a month. Changing this parameter to `80` will almost expose 4500 nominators. \n\nThe new chill-threshold will ensure that the permissionless `chill_other` can only be used when more than 90% of \"maximum nominator count\" is used.\nnote that to ensure polkadot's stability until the parachains launch, this motion does not yet include an increase in the total count of nominators. Multiple tracks of optimization are ongoing by the development team, and you can read more about them in this [issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9511).\n\nPlease note that doubling the value of the parameter to `80` DOTs will hopefully give the team more time until the new threshold is reached and we have made progress on a more permanent solution. Please leave your comments and feedback on the proposal. Keep in mind these measures are temporary, and the overall goal is the stability and security of the overall network. \n\n\n- Preimage can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZdXO1y6_UUlsjaPZgNla6elaMUQgtOxS/view?usp=sharing).\n\n- Hash: `0xc8ca426c26fc637ab82f56e69e91469c6c7205b01609e7970c0ed11cc0c7981f`\n- Encoded call data: `0x07170040b743ba00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e457000001b0040000015a`",

OneBlock is committed to advocate Substrate technology and cultivate the Substrate ecosystem. As early as the year of 2019, OneBlock already started the early efforts of Substrate courses and cultivated more than 1200 Substrate developers as of now. Lots of the students from the Substrate courses of OneBlock become founders, CTOs, and core developers of the early Polkadot ecosystem projects. We also successfully delivered the spring Substrate hackathon in March with over 110 participating individuals in 33 teams and a high-profile judging panel with the people from Parity core devs, top VCs, top blockchain tech medias, top community leaders, etc. \n\n[The first polkadot hackathon](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h9fsn9Yimic2PI53hjAGnFZShLQ8g6hSfDFYz4ujawY/edit#) in March 2021 was a success and it indeed helped to promote Substrate as an open-source framework for developers and convert the Substrate students from our ongoing Substrate courses to actually use Substrate to build projects. Receiving warm feedback from the developers, OneBlock decided to have a second (summer) Substrate hackathon and hereby submit this proposal for the necessary financial support on this event. \n\nThis summer Substrate hackathon, along with the entire Substrate hackathon program of 2021,  has clear goals to 1) attract more Substrate enthusiasts to learn Substrate and participate in the Polkadot community, 2) influence developers with ambitions to deliver more high-quality Substrate-based projects and 3) build and grow a robust, diversified and healthy Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem. \n\n here and you can get all details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ujln1u9k8MpjMVbwi06LbtSLBasmqzf0C3KNybPnC_0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease feel free to comments!",

These numbers are obtained by taking the average score of Polkadot/Kusama election for the last 50 eras, and taking their average, then multiplied by 50% to take into account network variability.\n\nAs an example, we know that the current entry barrier of Polkadot's validators set is around 1.69 MDOT. This motion will impose any validator set elected henceforth to present a least-staked validators of at least 847.4 KDOT (50% of the current average). Similarly, we know that the average amount staked in Polkadot now is around 655 MDOT. This motion will ensure that all staking election henceforth will at least put 327.69 MDOT at stake.\n\nNote that these numbers need to be updated on a semi-regular basis, depending on the staking rate of the network. Although, given that (lenient) 50% threshold applied to the scores, we don't expect this to be very often.\n\nLastly, note that this motion has no impact on the current staking parameters. All validators and nominators continue to operate as they did.\nThe script used to deduce this motion can be found [here](https://github.com/kianenigma/polkadot-election-score-stats/blob/master/src/index.ts) and it is similar to the [motion proposed last week on Kusama Network](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/337).\n\n**Polkadot numbers:**\n\n- `8474057820699941`, 847.4057 kDOT\n- `3276970719352749444`, 327.6970 MDOT\n- `244059208045236715654727835467163294`, 24.4059 YDOT",

      "title": "Marketing and PR Proposal for Polkadot in APAC",
      "content": "Treasury Proposal\n\nThis Proposal to Polkadot Treasury aims to boost the brand recognition of Polkadot to a broader group of audience in APAC.\n\nProposer: （Winkrypto） DOT Address: 158fp6BNaiUF6G13EFeeditNz2YVQeMtY68M6D4pEqqCgrdC \n\nDate: July 28th, 2021 Requested DOT: 2041 DOTs (Rate: 14.698 USD/DOT as of the 28th July, which is equivalent of 30,000USD) \n\nShort description: The media and marketing plan to bring the brand awareness and community influence on a broader group of general blockchain audience.\n\nBrief Introduction\n\nWinkrypto proposes to provide a customized media and marketing service package to boost the brand recognition and community influence of Polkadot to a broader group of blockchain audiences in APAC through Winkrypto and ChainNews. Polkadot has gained good traction in the Polkadot audience but certainly, it has broad room to expand the media exposure and community awareness to the fast-growing broader general blockchain audience. Winkrpto and ChainNews (see the explanation of business relationship in the below section) are here to help to bring the general awareness of Polkadot in the Chinse-speaking community to another level.\n\nBackground\n\nWinkrpto, together with ChainNews being the top blockchain media, can provide the top blockchain media and blockchain technology advocating service in APAC market, both to English and Chinese audience.\n\nWhy us?\n\nChainNews is the top tier professional blockchain media in Chinese speaking community. We have the top influence and resource to generate the best content with business insights and unique view and delivery the contents to the desired blockchain audience maximumly. Outperforming other blockchain marketing service providers, ChainNews aims to be the best service provider in this market sector.\n\nWhat problem is the Treasury fund used to solve?\n\nPolkadot gains pretty good traction in APAC marketing for the Polkdot audience in the time frame of late 2019 and the year of 2020. However the size of the general blockchain audience grows fast and there is still broad room for Polkadot to expand to gain the bigger size of the pie. WinKrypto as a top blockchain marketing service provider, together with ChainNews, the top professional blockchain media, is able to help Polkadot to achieve this goal and gain more audience in general blockchain pie. Winkrypto has the confidence to converte our business insight and deep understanding of the Asian market of the blockchain into the practical help and effective deliverables to Polkadot.\n\nWinkrypto would design a customized yet comprehensive package to help Polkadot to gain wider exposure in media and community. We plans to generate the top quality content with the blockchain insider’s view and deliver these content through our media matrix for the maximum coverage of the blockchain audience in the APAC market. We will also provide the deliverable and the performance report (ok to work with your local team to design the performance tracking mechanism) periodically.\n \nSolutions\n\nThe General Plan of 2021\n\nWinkrypto and ChainNews offers a customized service package to improve the overall Polkadot brand, increase media exposure, and broaden community awareness.\n\nFollowing are the three folds of the plan,\n\n1） Publicize official events from Polkadot and the aligned community partners in the Asia Pacific (Will work with Polkadot’s local teams and local community partners in APAC)\n\nThe plan of 2021 includes but not limited to the following major official events (currently six major ones)\n\n• 4 Substrate Hackathons\n\n• 2021 Web3.0 Bootcamp\n\n• 2021 Web3.0 Forum\n\nFor each event, Winkrypto and ChainNews provides the following media support,\n\n• A long introductory article about the event, including the way to sign up or how to buy tickets. (Note: Will work with Polkadot local team to produce the article and content. Winkrypto polishes the article and provides publishing channels.)\n A post-event summary with photos, videos, or any available rich media materials (Note: Will work with Polkadot local team to produce the article and content. Winkrypto polishes the article and provides publishing channels.)\n\n2）Publicize outstanding projects in Polkadot Ecology\n\n2021 Polkadot Ecology Outstanding Projects: Outstanding projects that emerge from Polkadot boot camps,Substrate Hackathons, Substrate Courses, and Substrate Workshops.\n\nCurrently, it is estimated to have the size of 10 projects of the year 2021, and the media support for each project includes,\n\n• A Breaking News about the project that has won an award or performed well at the Polkadot event.  An Introductory article about the project (founding team, the vision of your project, the project features, product roadmap, the projection of the project, etc.)\n\nBesides these 10 projects, special merit projects may also receive ad-hoc reporting and media support per the recommendation of the local team of Polkadot and their local community partners.\n\n3.\tPublicize the strategy of Polkadot Ecosystem development in APAC from the local team of Polkadot\n\n• The comprehensive support to Substrate Devs in Polkadot Ecosystem • APAC Strategy of Polkadot Ecosystem Development\n\nIn a nutshell, the quantity of the breaking news and article are listed below:\n\nActivity – 12 Articles Project - 10 Articles & Breaking News Polkadot Team- 2 Articles\n\nYou can review the full proposal [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1by1Y690P8-ZgNbqAOD3qCLNT-BX3T_P_/view?usp=sharing) Please leave your comments!\n",

      "title": "Cloudflare Enterprise Plan for Subscan from August 2021 to October 2021",
      "content": "> Past discussions: <https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/541>\n\nSubscan is an aggregate high-precision blockchain explorer for Substrate-based chains. We have been supporting several influential blockchains, including Polkadot, Kusama, Rococo, and Westend for over a year. For many users, Subscan is their first stop in the blockchain world. As we continue to deliver new features and support more blockchains, our user base is on the steady rise. Therefore, high robustness and availability are currently among our major concerns.\n## Why We Can't Do Without a Firewall?\nIn the past few months, we have become one of many victims of multiple DDoS attacks. For example, here are some of the screenshots from the Google Cloud Platform Load Balancer and our Nginx monitoring system during one of the attacks:\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/chart-nginx-under-attack.png)\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/chart-gcp-load-balancer-under-attack.png)\n\nThe attacker generated much more packets and requests per second than usual. This forced us to find a firewall to protect Subscan and filter out DDoS traffic. In the next few days, we enabled Cloudflare as our firewall and CDN provider. However, attackers still point to Subscan as a valuable target. The following chart from Cloudflare shows that it successfully prevented many potential malicious attempts in a day:\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/cloudflare-firewall-analysis-june-21.png)\n\nFortunately, we are able to mitigate the impact of those attempts and Subscan has not had any major outage due to DDoS attacks since using Cloudflare.\n## Why We Need the Cloudflare Enterprise Plan?\nUp until June, we had been utilizing Cloudflare for some months. A considerable number of users reported multiple service interruptions in certain areas during the month. Benefit from the complete monitoring pipeline built by Subscan DevOps team, we noticed and observed the issues shortly after it was raised. For example, here are two dashboard snapshots on June 2nd and June 8th, which showing a very similar phenomenon:\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/cloudflare-public-plan-incident-june-2nd.png)\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/cloudflare-public-plan-incident-june-8th.png)\n\nWith careful diagnosis and analysis, we managed to pinpoint the cause. They coincided with some Cloudflare incidents of the Pro plan. The screenshot below recorded the announcement and postmortem by our DevOps team explaining the incident at that time:\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/cloudflare-public-plan-incident-impacted-subscan.png)\n\nAfter consulting with Cloudflare sales and support, we realized that the enterprise plan is a great choice that meets our high availability requirements, just as they suggested. Argo smart routing, one core feature included in the enterprise plan, can help us re-route the traffic during zonal network failures. The enhanced WAF rules can be even more accurate and effective in blocking the attackers. Beyond that, here are also several features that we can utilize to improve Subscan's accessibility and reliability.\n## What Other Features Can the Cloudflare Enterprise Plan Offer to Us?\nOpting into the Cloudflare enterprise plan will bring about other advantages besides higher availability.\nFor example, Argo smart routing promises an estimated increase of 30% in network latency.\n\nAlso, a relatively large proportion of Subscan users comes from mainland China, where Internet access can be unpredictable sometimes. With the Cloudflare enterprise plan, we can utilize their China network infrastructure to offer a faster and more reliable experience for visitors inside China.\n\nThe technical support for Cloudflare enterprise users is apparently better than other plans as well. We will be able to contact the support engineers, if there is any incident, via emails and even phone calls rather than just tickets. This allows us to become more proactive and advantageous in providing highly avaialble services to Subscan users in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n## The Financial Support\nWe have received financial support from the Polkadot treasury during the past month, and such support proved fruitful. This proposal is for financing Subscan's upgrade to the Cloudflare enterprise plan, which amounts to 967 DOTs. This includes 5000 $USD per month, and 3 months in total (August 2021 ~ October 2021), according to the EMA30 price `1 DOT ≈ 15.5 $USD`.\n\nThe quotation of the enterprise plan for Subscan can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/blob/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october/cloudflare-enterprise-quotation.xlsx).\n\nIn case we missed any information or you have any questions, please feel free to send us an inquiry.\n## References\n- Cloudflare Enterprise plan: <https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/enterprise/>\n- Cloudflare Argo: <https://www.cloudflare.com/products/argo-smart-routing/>\n- Cloudflare incident on June 2nd: <https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/zbzjv8sm3g94>\n- Cloudflare incident on June 8th: <https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/incidents/2hnqwq90dlrk>\n> The source code of this proposal is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/tree/master/cloudflare-enterprise-2021-august-to-october).\n\n",

      "title": " Funding of Polkadotters community",
      "content": "The purpose of this proposal is to reward all the activities by the Polkadotters community that was founded in August 2020. We have started the biggest Polkadot community in the Czech/Slovak region that is nowadays a central hub for all Polkadot users from the region. But our plans were always to go international and therefore we created a Polkadotters brand and started to publish everything in English as well.\nThe reason why we are asking for this reward is that I left my full-time job in order to become a Polkadot ambassador and devote my professional life to the promotion of the Polkadot and Web 3.0 vision. I didn't have any other means of income except being a validator (Polkadotters enjoys the freedom of the press by not being paid for promotions or marketing :-) \n\nI know we should have asked for this some time ago but I finally got the courage to reach the Polkadot council for our support as of now. \n\nA detailed version of our proposal with calculations and rationales can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iYqRt1ZB1E1XSZhwk5zH1J8Io_SkjtH8MINl9-ibN8k/edit#heading=h.4uhl8jouxvv5), however, I will try to sum up our activity over here as well\n\n**Social media**\n\n- Facebook (Polkadot CZ/SK) - 4.3k members\n- Twitter (Polkadotters) - over 1.5k followers\n- Medium (Polkadotters) - over 600 followers\n\n**Content**\n- Medium - over 60 original articles in both Czech and English\n- YouTube - over 20k views on Polkadot videos in the Czech language\n\n**Other activities**\n - founding the [DOT Validator Alliance](http://dotvalidators.org/manifesto)\n - education about Substrate and development (being a developer myself)\n - hackathon participation\n - promotion of Polkadot on various Czech cryptocurrency events\n - participating in testnets and helping projects to start their networks\n - and many others\n\nI created this post as the basis for the discussion with the council since I am not sure how much I can ask and what's the view of the council on such a proposal. I will appreciate any feedback and I am looking forward to the council's response.  \n\nAccording to the 30-day DOT price average, we are currently asking for 2,736 DOT or roughly $41,280. This includes all the activities we have been doing for the community as well as the creation of our content and spreading it out to the Polkadot communities all over the world. \n\nI am really grateful for the council's support and I am definitely open to the adjustment of my proposal. II tried to back my request with some numbers because I know it would be outright rejected s so here they are and I would love to discuss the details with you! Thank you very much :-)\n\n",

      "title": "Patract's treasury proposal about Metis M1 (ink! and Ask! Standard Library)",
      "content": "This is copy from [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/469](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/469)\n\n[Metis](https://github.com/patractlabs/metis) will be the Wasm contract standard library developed by Patract Labs. Patract Labs will work with community forces to formulate various Wasm contract standards, develop corresponding implementations of ink! and Ask! versions, and conduct audits by professional institutions.\n\n## 0. Motivation\n\nWe believe that in the Wasm contract ecosystem, a development library similar to Openzeppelin-contracts is very necessary. This is Metis. For the sake of simplicity and readability, the patterns and meta-language provided by this library should be as consistent with Openzeppelin-contracts as possible, so as to reduce the burden on developers and effectively absorb the experience accumulated in the Solidity ecosystem.\n\nBut you need to realize that the Wasm contract development based on ink! and Ask! is very different from the EVM contract development based on Solidity. Wasm's mature system support allows developers to use a variety of different languages and tools to develop smart contracts. Based on these mature or rapid iteration platforms, developers can enjoy a large number of underlying facilities support and development experience accumulation, but different languages and tools often have different considerations and trade-offs. This means that developers will use completely different codes to express the same mechanism and design, which will bring huge communication costs and mental burdens to the community.\n\nFaced with such problems, we need to summarize and accumulate the implementation model in the development of smart contracts. This idea was introduced in the book \"Implementation Patterns\" by Kent Beck. The purpose of summarizing the implementation mode is to clearly and accurately express the developer's intentions and ideas through these clear patterns, so that \"code that others can understand\" can be implemented. In contract development, this idea is very important.\n\nFrom Openzeppelin-contracts, we can see that it summarizes several implementation models in the development of smart contracts, such as the \"contract expansion model\" based on the Solidity inheritance grammar. These implementation models are valuable experience accumulated in the Solidity ecology. Of course, different languages have different ways of practicing these modes. Metis will implement these modes and provide corresponding support on different platforms. For example, in Rust, it is obvious that you cannot directly use inheritance to implement contract expansion. For this, Metis will provide code implementation examples and provide a series of help libraries to reduce the developer's mental cost.\n\nMetis will be more than just a Wasm contract standard library. We hope that through the practice of Metis, we can fully inherit and absorb previous contract development experience while exploring the best practices of Wasm contract development.\n\n## 1. Problem\n\nAt present, contract-based developers mainly face the following problems:\n\n- Lack of reliable implementation of common contracts (such as ERC20)\n- It is difficult to achieve contract combination and expansion similar to the Solidity inheritance mechanism\n- Lack of a series of reliable public components to implement contracts\n- Lack of experience accumulation and model summary based on ink! development contracts\n\nThe above problems severely limit the current ink!-based contract development ecology. Metis will solve these problems while avoiding the existing problems in Solidity.\n\n## 2. Contract Standard Library\n\nMetis will implement a series of common components, similar to the Openzeppelin-contracts development library. These components will be thoroughly tested and code audited. These components will be as consistent as possible with Openzeppelin-contracts, which can reduce the burden on developers and effectively absorb the experience accumulated in the Solidity ecosystem.\n\nMetis will include the following components:\n\n- Openzeppelin-contracts-like components, including basic Access and Security components, as well as Token and Governance components\n- Component developed for ink! contracts, wasm-based contracts can support better abstraction mechanisms, and we can implement more complex and practical components\n- Summarizing abstract components from mature contract projects, metis will absorb the experience and accumulation of the community, including both the mature Solidity ecology and emerging blockchain contract projects.\n- The expansion of ink! contracts, including basic data structures for different scenarios, etc.\n\nIn the previous version of Metis, we will first implement Openzeppelin-contracts-like components for developers to use. These components include:\n\n- Token: ERC20, ERC721, ERC777, ERC1155 and the expansion contract of the above Token contract\n- Access: Ownable, AccessControl, TimelockController\n- Security: PullPayment, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable\n\n## 3. ink! component\n\nMost of Metis development libraries are composed of contract components. In Solidity, the introduction of contract components can be implemented based on inheritance. Generally, the contract components will include the following parts:\n\n- Component Storage: The storage state related to the logic of the component itself, these states do not need to be exposed to the outside\n- Component Message: The externally-facing Message of the component\n- Component Event: The event that the component's own logic will  emit\n- Component internal interface: an interface for other logic in the contract to call\n\nFor example, common Ownable contracts:\n\n```Solidity\nabstract contract Ownable is Context {\n    // Component Storage\n    address private _owner;\n\n    // Component Event\n    event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);\n    \n    // Component internal interface\n    modifier onlyOwner() {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    // Component Event\n    function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIf a contract needs to be Ownable, just inherit the contract:\n\n```Solidity\ncontract Escrow is Ownable {\n...\n}\n```\n\nSimilarly, other components can also have Ownable through inheritance:\n\n```Solidity\ncontract Pausable is Ownable {\n  ...\n  function unpause() public onlyOwner whenPaused {\n      ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe intention of inheritance here is actually composition rather than an `is-a` relationship. Although excessive use of inheritance in Solidity will cause many problems, inheritance for specific intentions is still an important way to achieve it.\n\nIn contract development based on ink!, through metis, we can also achieve the same motivation based on generics and traits:\n\n```rust\n...\n\n#[metis::contract] // metis contract macro, will use ink_lang::contract auto\nmod flipper {\n    ...\n\n    #[ink(storage)]\n    #[import(ownable)] // flipper import the ownable\n    pub struct Flipper {\n        ownable: ownable::Data<Flipper>, // data by ownable\n\n        value: bool,\n    }\n\n    #[ink(event)]\n    #[metis(ownable)] // TODO: event in ink! will refactor\n    pub struct OwnershipTransferred {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    impl Flipper {\n        ...\n\n        #[ink(message)]\n        pub fn flip(&mut self) {\n            // check owner\n            ownable::Impl::ensure_caller_is_owner(self);\n\n            self.value = !self.value;\n        }\n\n        ...\n\n        #[ink(message)]\n        pub fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) {\n            ownable::Impl::renounce_ownership(self) // owner message\n        }\n\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMetis assists developers to achieve the same function through a series of helper macros. In order to improve the auditability of the contract, here we hope that users clearly implement storage, event and message declarations.\n\nAt the same time, metis has improved the implementation of components:\n\n```rust\n...\n\n// Storage\n#[metis::component::storage]\npub struct Data<E>\nwhere\n    E: Env,\n{\n    owner: Lazy<Option<E::AccountId>>,\n}\n\n// Event trait\npub trait EventEmit<E: Env>: EnvAccess<E> {\n    ...\n}\n\n// Impl trait\npub trait Impl<E: Env>: Storage<E> + EventEmit<E> {\n    // logics\n    fn init(&mut self) {\n        self.get_mut().set_ownership(&Some(Self::caller()));\n    }\n\n    fn renounce_ownership(&mut self) {\n        self.ensure_caller_is_owner();\n\n        self.emit_event_ownership_transferred(\n            self.get().get_ownership().clone(),\n            None);\n\n        self.get_mut().set_ownership(&None);\n    }\n\n    ...\n\n    /// Panic if `owner` is not an owner\n    fn ensure_owner(&self, owner: &E::AccountId) {\n        assert!(&self.get().get_ownership().clone().unwrap() == owner);\n    }\n\n    ...\n}\n\n```\n\nSuch components can extend their functions by inheriting other components, such as an ERC20 component with the function of destroying tokens:\n\n```rust\n...\n\npub trait Impl<E>: erc20::Impl<E>\nwhere\n    E: Env,\n{\n    fn _burn(&mut self, account: &E::AccountId, amount: E::Balance) -> Result<()> {\n        ...\n    }\n\n    fn burn(&mut self, amount: E::Balance) -> Result<()> {\n        self._burn(&Self::caller(), amount)\n    }\n\n    fn burn_from(&mut self, account: &E::AccountId, amount: E::Balance) -> Result<()> {\n        ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBased on metis, we can implement various contract combination modes implemented by Solidity through inheritance under limited intent, and at the same time, with the help of rust's zero-cost abstraction, these abstractions will not bring additional performance consumption.\n\n## 4. Overall Roadmap\n\nMetis for ink! is divided into several milestones:\n\n- **[M1]** Implement basic component macros and components, improve component testing support, developers can build regular DAPPs based on Metis\n- **[M2]** Complete component macros, complete component development support, developers can build custom components. Complete the api support corresponding to the metis component.\n- **[M3]** Rich component library, complete component and API support for governance and financial mechanism, perfect mathematical library suitable for contract development to support DeFi-type contracts that require complex calculations.\n\nConsidering that the current ink! and contract-pallet are still in iteration, some metis features will be implemented based on subsequent improvements, including:\n\n* Contract proxy and upgradeable support will depend on the improvement of subsequent contract calls, by [739](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/739).\n* The Event in the component, the Event in the current ink! cannot be independent of the contract, by [759](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/759), the event in the current component is only an early implementation, and it will be refactored based on the improvement of ink! in the future.\n\nWith the richness and completeness of the ink! contract community, metis will further implement more public components and libraries to assist developers in developing large-scale contract projects. Therefore, we may arrange [MR] milestones. It will be developed based on the iterative schedule of ink!\n\n* **[MR]** According to the ink!'s iterative progress, community feedback, contract upgrades, contract proxy and cross-contract call support, refactor Event-related implementations, improve basic components and add development assistance macros to reduce duplication while ensuring auditability Code.\n\n## 5. Detailed timeline of M1 (3 developers * 5 weeks)\n\n- Week 1: \n  - M1.1 Design and develop macros that support the development of metis components, and determine the component development paradigm\n  - M1.2 Design and develop macros that support the introduction of metis components into contracts, and determine the development paradigm for contract expansion and introduction of components\n- Week 2:\n  - M1.3 Design and develop unit test support for components\n  - M1.4 design and develop integration test support based on Redspot\n- Week 3:\n  - M1.5 Complete the implementation and testing of Access related components\n  - M1.6 Complete the implementation and testing of Security related components\n- Week 4:\n  - M1.7 Complete the implementation and testing of Token related components\n  - M1.8 Complete the detailed Metis component design document\n- Week 5:\n  - M1.9 Complete documentation and examples of metis components\n\nCost of M1 (15 developers \\* weeks):\n* Operating activities: $3000 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per employee \\* week )\n* Developer payments: $28500 ( $1900 per developer \\* week )\n* Total Cost: $31500\n* Treasury Proposal: 1525 DOT ($20.65/DOT @ 28Jun)\n\n## 6.

      "content": "This treasury proposal is Between the Polkadot Council and MIDLDEV OÜ, a company registered in Estonia with registry number 14973249, commonly known as [MIDL.dev](https://midl.dev/).\n\n# Service description\n\n1.  A functioning infrastructure to provide usable blockchain database snapshots for the Polkadot network, to the benefit of node operators and validators,\n    \n2.  New snapshots at least once per day. Snapshots are filesystem dump of the Polkadot node storage backend file, of variety RocksDb, of type pruned, with a depth of 1000 blocks, compressed in 7z format, that can be used by validators to quickly spin up or restore their infrastructure,\n    \n3.  A website frontend at [polkashots.io](https://polkashots.io/) with relevant metadata and download links, including a permanent link that always redirects to the most recent snapshot,\n    \n4.  Best effort incident and problem management,\n    \n5.  Redundant implementation setup which allows for continuity, seamless upgrades and basic disaster recovery & contingency management.\n    \n6.  Make snapshots available on IPFS and pin them for 3 days\n    \n\n### Context\n\nThe website [polkashots.io](https://polkashots.io/) has been operational for 6 months now and providing Polkadot and Kusama pruned snapshots for validators. It has had excellent uptime. It is currently the only provider for this service. It is very frequently mentioned in the Validator Lounge Matrix channels and there are [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE6GJGvIur8) referencing them. It is beneficial to the ecosystem by providing a path for validators to quickly and safely recover from a storage failure or migrate their operations.\n\n## Evolution over time\n\nShall substrate/polkadot add support for a useful native snapshot format, the platform will switch to providing these formats instead of a filesystem dump.\n\nShall substrate/polkadot implement a “warp sync” technology or any other technology, if this technology results in centrally managed snapshot services no longer be the most expedient way of starting or recovering a validator node, this agreement will expire and the service will cease.\n\n## Operational expenses\n\nThe labor cost is 1000 EUR/month including 2 engineers in 2 different time zones. The cloud cost varies and is currently estimated at 300 EUR/month.\n\n## Funding request from Polkadot treasury\n\nMIDLDEV OÜ will make funding requests to the Polkadot treasury every 6 months:\n\n-   The first request will cover the period January-June 2021. The future requests will cover post-paid funding of operational expenses, for the previous 6 months.\n    \n-   Operational expenses consist of labor costs of 1000 EUR/month plus the cloud costs with a 50% markup. Cloud costs include costs of operating the node, storing the files and operating the website frontend.\n    \n-   We will be operating the polkashots service in a dedicated Google Cloud project (or equivalent in a different cloud provider) for accurate metering and pricing.\n    \n-   This proposal is for Polkadot, we submitted [an equivalent proposal for the Kusama network](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/93)\n    \n## Budget\n```\n| Cost item                             | Monthly cost             |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Labor                                 | 1000 EUR /mo             |\n| 150% Cloud costs (estimate)           | 450 EUR /mo              |\n| Total (monthly)                       | 1,450.00 EUR /mo         |\n| Total (bi-annually)                   | 8,700 EUR bi-anually     |\n| Exchange rate DOT/EUR                 | 17.34 EUR (20.666 USD)   |\n| Total base price in DOT (bi-annually) | 501.730                  |\n| Slippage + conversion fee 5%          | 25.087                   |\n| Proposal (DOT)                        | 526.817                  |\n```\n\n## Payment conditions\n\n-   to calculate the price, we use Subscan's 30 avg tool at the day of submission:\n    \n\n       -   Polkadot: [https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n    \n     -   Kusama: [https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n    \n \n-  Trading-slippage will be taken into account by adding a 5% surplus to the DOT base-price\n    \n-   Proposal should be approved to cover the upcoming 6 months, not the 6 months of work done before.\n    \n-   Work will start upon approval.",

      "content": "The proposal will upgrade the nomination limits such that more people can start nominating. Note that this is a time-sensitive action, because currently existing nominators cannot change their intentions. [This pull request](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9193) will change this logic, so that those who are already a nominator will not be affected by any limit, and **will be placed in the next Polkadot  runtime upgrade**.\n\nThe new limits increase the nominator capacity by `2500` (making it `22500` in total), and increase the the stake threshold to `40DOTs`. It is intended that these numbers would keep the current count of nominators (all of whom must have 40 or more DOTs) below the new count limit (`22500`) **until the next runtime upgrade**: If an influx of nominators is observed over a very short period of time, the stake limit might need to be increased again proportionally to keep the staking system stable.\n\nPreimage [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Pp8mkUkFCkYiauUAe2RXFBhzk5wgulGV/view?usp=sharing).\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

      "content": "The proposal **sets a limit on the maximum number of validators**, namely `1200`, and leaves the rest of the parameters unchanged (`20000`/`20DOTs`) for nominators. This proposal started as an **external motion**, meaning that if the Council passes this, the community needs to vote in referenda queue to be executed. \n\nThe validator community should be aware that the discussion around minimum DOT stake limit for validators (similar to what was imposed recently on nominators) has already begun [on the Polkadot Direction channel](https://matrix.to/#/!OwgojQyBzTlUQGGLhq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), and will be proposed **as soon as discussion reaches consensus**. Similar to the nominator limits, **these limits are for the safety of the network and will grow as the network grows.**\n\nThe preimage of this proposal can be found [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W8J1zSPobzNMSAoAWaSeTWvLRI7QdmwH/view?usp=sharing). \n\nContext on why this is needed and an explanation of the scaling issues we are seeing on Polkadot Network can be found on the [last runtime upgrade post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/88).\n\nPlease vote at your convenience!",

      "title": "Treasury proposal: The June/July/August operating cost for the nonprofit organization Polkadot Ecology Research Institute",
      "content": "Hi, all councillors:\n\nThe proposal aims to seek support from the Polkadot Treasury for the June/July/August operating cost for the Chinese non-profit organization Polkadot Ecology Research Institute, in order to create more original and quality Chinese content, and to relay the otherwise boring technical language to Chinese users in a colloquial way, so that Chinese users can have a real knowledge of Polkadot and increase the breadth of Polkadot in the Chinese market. On the other hand, we will also follow up on the outstanding projects of the Polkadot ecology to keep everyone informed of the latest developments of the Polkadot ecology.\n\nPolkadot's success cannot be separated from the prosperity of the Polkadot Ecological Projects. Our goal is to make more people aware of Polkadot and also to make more people aware of the development of Polkadot ecology, which in turn will lead them to join in the participation and construction of Polkadot ecology, so that Polkadot and Polkadot ecology can flourish.\n\nSo this is a proposal for our three months operation cost. We apply approx 1,883.18 DOT total allocation for June, July, August depending on EMA(30) AVG rate (DOT = 22.90 USDT) [here](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) and you can get all details [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1njBTICPm8HNAzsmJExZdCCW2GqowrJac0UuMyrphOfw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nIf you have any questions, please give me feedback.\n\nThanks!",

      "title": "The Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot Network from March 2021 to May 2021",
      "content": "Subscan is an aggregated Blockchain explorer for Substrate-based chains. We have supported several chains, such as Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend, for more than one year. We have seen an encouraging trend in the number of users and their activeness since last August. However, with the rapid growth of users, stability and reliability in infrastructure are becoming a challenge. We have to pay large bills to ensure the quality of our service.\n\nSubscan is supposed to be a financially independent service in the long run. However, although it is starting to generate some revenue, it still falls short for the time being. Therefore, we wish to get some financial support of the Polkadot Treasury to continue our commitment to the improvement of our service.\n\nFollowing are some statistics of the current service scale of Subscan.\n\n## Current Service Scale of Subscan\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-march-to-may/subscan-cloudflare.png)\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-march-to-may/subscan-qps-per-network.png)\n\nWe can see from the charts that Polkadot accounts for the absolute majority of all requests by Subscan.\n\n## Billing Info\n\nThe infrastructure cost refers to what we spent on Subscan for Polkadot Network (<https://polkadot.subscan.io/>) on the Google Cloud Platform. Following are the rounded figures for the past three months (March to May 2021).\n\nMarch 2021:  $6593.67\n\nApril 2021: $6524.53\n\nMay 2021: $7668.53\n\n**Subtotal: $20786.73**\n\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-march-to-may/cost-table-march.png)\n\n![](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-march-to-may/cost-table-april.png)\n\n![](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/raw/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-march-to-may/cost-table-may.png)\n\n*Compute Engine*, *Stackdriver Logging*, and *Cloud SQL* are the three primary services, among which *Compute Engine* alone constitutes around 80% of the total cost. Detailed billing info and other relevant proof are available in private upon request.\n\n**The estimated infrastructure cost we spent on Polkadot adds up to $18,000. Therefore, the amount we are requesting is 780 DOT (1 DOT ≈ 23 $USD). Such support is indispensable for our goal to capitalize on economies of scale.**\n\n## References\n\n- Subscan for Polkadot Network: <https://polkadot.subscan.io/>\n- Subscan Service Status: <https://subscan.statuspage.io/>\n\n\n\n> The source code of this proposal is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/itering/subscan-treasury-proposals/blob/master/infrastructure-costs-2021-march-to-may/polkadot.md).",

Figment retains 0 DOTs for operational costs as part of this proposal.\n\n**Short description:** Figment is creating a proposal to request DOTs to be used as incentives to grow the Polkadot developer ecosystem via its platforms Figment Learn and DataHub. Learn is the education and onboarding platform for developers interested in Web 3 development. With Learn, developers gain access to the most comprehensive developer portal which standardizes documentation across networks and offers in-depth practical tutorials to help them get to the next level.\n\nTutorials can be completed seamlessly with DataHub which provides easy access to the protocols via our highly available full node infrastructure and suite of middleware. Developers then get to build and scale their DApps for free using the DataHub infrastructure.\n\n**Original proposal doc:**\n\n**[Visit this link for the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkgnwLhjVCCrKY43uRgzg6vFI6yN_aoD_TCxBdkNAg8/edit#l)**",

      "title": "Increasing the WASM heap pages.",
      "content": "**UPDATE: Please be so kind to reject this proposal, the team has included the heap pages increase on an upgrade and this seems to be the best way to approach the issue.**\n\n---\n\nWe’ve noticed that some validator nodes on polkadot, encounter a “allocator failed to allocate memory” error around the time when the staking election (phragmen) is being computed. Recall that this computation is happening in an **offchain worker thread**. Nonetheless, in the current implementation, the offchain worker thread, which itself is executed in WASM, uses the same WASM environment as the canonical runtime, and therefore has limited memory. To prevent the situation where no validator submits an election solution, the amount of memory accessible to the offchain worker environment should be increased.\n\nNote that ideally, this change should only affect the offchain worker thread, and not the main runtime. But as mentioned, currently they share the same configurations. A long term solution is to separate these configurations and only increase the amount of memory that is accessible to the offchain worker ([PR](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8885)). But, since this is not readily possible, we opt to propose increasing the overall WASM runtime memory pages, which affects both block execution and offchain worker. We expect this decision to have **no notable effect** on the main runtime’s progress and execution.\n\nThe amount of memory available to WASM is determined in the number of “pages of memory” that can be allocated in the called, aka. “**Heap pages**”. This value lives on-chain, and you can inspect it similar to other [well-known-keys via “:heappages](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/28107d402cb88cf50119c4ecb16555fcacf3a3e6/primitives/storage/src/lib.rs#L166)”. Currently, no value is set there and a [default of 1024](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/ef0e22e11535abaa393122209f83ed02a068a464/client/executor/src/native_executor.rs#L48) is used.\n\nMore info can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12CFQlgBxWwBOcpyoJiNhifvAoPQKBDej9f3YRf9Moq8/edit?usp=sharing). This proposal is a temporary solution, Kian from Parity is working on a permanent fix [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8885).\n\nPreimage for the motion [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1gQKqzYKo2CL-GrsZI2qNonH_kwGZXG/view?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Patract's Treasury proposal for Europa v0.3 (contract and runtime sandbox)",
      "content": "This is copy from [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/410](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/410)\n\n[Patract Labs](https://patract.io) started Patract Open Platform to promote Wasm contract technology in the Polkadot community. At present, dozens of parachain and DApp projects have joined, and [Europa](github.com/patractlabs/europa) has also been widely used in the community. 4 months ago we applied   [treasury proposal #27](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/27) for Europa v0.2, and 3 months ago we wrote a [development report #250](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/250). In the past 3 months, we have also followed up with the updates of `Pallet-Contracts` and `ink!`.\n\nEuropa is a sandbox environment for running `Pallet-Contracts`. Contract developers can use the executable files compiled by Europa to debug `ink!` contracts. Europa is also a framework that provides a sandbox environment for Substrate Runtime. Parachain developers can implement a sandbox environment for their specific Runtime.\n\nEuropa provides minimal service components that support Runtime to package and execute extrinsics normally. Therefore, although Europa can be regarded as a node, this node does not have a consensus system, no network connection, and only retains the Runtime executor, RPC and some other necessary services. In addition, as a sandbox for Wasm contract operation, we modified `Pallet-Contracts` to provide more detailed debugging information, including contract execution information (information in `Pallet-Contracts`) and Wasm execution information. In order to facilitate debugging and add new features, Europa removed all Wasm components in Substrate, so any `std` code can be added to the entire system of Europa to meet experimental requirements.\n\n## Europa's future plan\n\n* v0.1(finished): Have an independent runtime environment to facilitate more subsequent expansion directions.\n\n* v0.2(finished): Modify at contract module level to provide more information。\n\n* v0.3: Improve the developement experience, strengthen collaboration with other tools, and extend the sandbox to be compatible with other runtime modules。\n\nThe original v0.3 plan about expanding Europa's compatibility with other Runtime modules has been completed in v0.1, so the focus of now work in v0.3 is to improve Europa's usablity, which is mainly divided into the following two parts:\n\n1. We plan to design the UI interface for Europa and implement the following product functions:\n\n   Currently, the only UI interface that can directly operate Europa is the Polkadot apps, but apps are for chain operations rather than contract operations. We expect to show more information and elements for the wasm contracts, and improve the contract interaction experience.\n\n   1. Strengthen the functions related to the contract execution system in the contract UI section:\n      1. Visualization of contract execution process information: The current important information about contract execution in Europa is directly printed to the log. Developers need to spend a lot of effort to filter out the required information in the log. Therefore, Europa will display it visually and provide some indexing functions;\n      2. The relationship between the contract and related extrinsics and events: for example, when you click on the contract address, you can list the contract extrinsics related to this contract; when you click on an account address, you can list all the related extrinsics of this account, etc., this feature can assist developers in the relationship between related extrinsics, accounts and contracts;\n      3. Scan all the contracts in the current Europa storage and build the relationship;\n      4. Link with a Redspot project in Europa, scan the account and executed extrinsics in the Redspot configuration file, and build the relationship between contracts, accounts, and extrinsics.\n   2. Provide the interface and UI to operate Europa's special RPC functions and display state changes. Europa has some special functions for the sandbox environment. Currently, it can only be executed or displayed through RPC calls, such as backward of block height, forward of block height, state execution changes, etc. Operating these functions through the UI interface lowers the threshold for users.\n   3. Combined with Europa's workspace function, you can create and select different workspaces through the UI interface.\n\n1. Similar to Ganache, Europa and UI will be made into binary packages for different platforms for distribution\n\n   Although Europa is open source, there will be a lot of trouble if you directly use the source code to compile on a different platform (such as Windows). Moreover, the compilation process is time-consuming and requires resources. Therefore, we will package Europa together with the UI into a binary executable file for distribution. Contract developers can download and execute the packaged Europa binary file directly, so that contract developers can run the node directly without worrying about how to set up the environment for running the contract. .\n\n## Detailed design of v0.3\n\n### 1. The UI Interface\n\n#### 1.1. Visualization of contract execution process\n\nIn v0.2, the execution information of the contract in Europa will only be displayed in the log, and the structure is as follows:\n\n```text\n1: NestedRuntime {\n    ext_result: [success] ExecReturnValue { flags: 0, data:  },\n    caller: d43593c715fdd31c61141abd04a99fd68...(5GrwvaEF...),\n    self_account: 0144d6fc570d7bddda6f8e3614...(5C6NMXaS...),\n    selector: 0x9bae9d5e,\n    args: 0x40420f00000000000000000000000000,\n    value: 10000000000000000,\n    gas_limit: 200000000000,\n    gas_left: 190018947968,\n    env_trace: [\n        seal_input(Some(0x9bae9d5e40420f00000000000000000000000000)),\n       ...\n    ],\n    sandbox_result_ok: Value(I32(0,),),\n    nest: [],\n}\n```\n\nEuropa UI needs to interpret and reorganize the information implemented by Europa in v0.2. Therefore, the implementation details of this development are as follows:\n\n1. Europa: In this version, the information needs to be associated with the extrinsic and stored in the Europa database developed by v0.1, and provide RPC for the outside to call.\n2. Europa UI: Return contract execution information by calling RPC with tx hash, analyze and draw it into Europa UI in a visual form . **you can see all the [15 prototype diagrams](https://modao.cc/app/c8a2d9ec53de7ccaf412fe7caf6275ec151ab9ed)**\n\nThe visualization of the contract execution process information is the most complicated part of the v0.3 product. **The focus of this part is to convert the intuitionally difficult or even unreadable information originally provided by Europa into visualized information combined with the matadata information of the contract, providing developers with an intuitive display of the contract execution process**.\n\nOne of the detailed prototype diagram is\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115189910-d41f2f80-a119-11eb-8303-e2e0cc0fe267.png)\n\nContract execution is associated with a extrinsic, which is divided into details and states. Details clearly shows the contract execution details originally in the log, and states shows the state changes involved in this extrinsic.\n\nThe top data is the overall data of the entire extrinsic, including the hash, result, block, timestamp, gas limit, gas used, extrinsic fee of the entire extrinsic, each box below represents a call, and boxes with different colors and indents represent calls For different levels, the same depth of call uses arrows of the same color. More complex details are displayed through the drop-down box of more details.\n\nTherefore, the important meaning of this prototype diagram is to show that the \"calling relationship of the contract (including the cross-contract call process)\" can visually show this process, and developers can only obtain relevant information by analyzing the relationship in the log of Europa in v0.2.\n\nThe meaning of the text in the diagram is as follows:\n\n* Result: ext_result in the output of nestedRuntime. A green check is displayed for success, and a red cross is displayed for failure.\n* Block: the block that the extrinsic is in \n* TimeStamp: The timestamp of the block\n* From: extrinsic caller\n* To: extrinsic recipient\n* value: the token sent by the extrinsic\n* extrinsic fee: extrinsic fee, based on the token of the chain\n* Gas Limit: The maximum gas that the extrinsic can consume\n* Gas used: The actual gas consumed by each call, followed by a percentage that occupies the limit\n* more details: This part is the details of each layer of contract calls, and contains more important information.\n\nTake the above picture as an example, the a81ac user calls the contract c650f, which is call 1. In the contract c650f, there are two more contracts called call 2 and call 3. The call depth of these two contracts is the same, so the same color arrow is used to display. Each call has a corresponding consumed gas and remaining gas. In the picture, call 2 consumes 2139256707 gas, and the remaining gas is 397860743293.\n\nAfter clicking \"more details\":\n\nThe correct execution is as follows:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115189966-eb5e1d00-a119-11eb-8b64-4e8663138a6b.png)\n\nThis part includes\n\n* Function: Function selector\n* Args: The parameters of the calling function.\n* trap reason: the reason for the end of this execution\n* env trace: host_function called during the execution of this contract\n\nAfter the user uploads the ABI of the contract, he can click the \"Decode parameters\" button to analyze the functions and parameters called by the contract.\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115190258-5871b280-a11a-11eb-9fbd-866db9c72dc1.png)\n\nWhen the Wasm contract executes panic, a Wasm execution call stack (backtrace) message will appear:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115190363-7c34f880-a11a-11eb-862d-229628cff6ae.png)\n\n#### 1.2. The association between the contract, related extrinsics, events, accounts, and Redspot\n\nThe realization of this function requires Europa to be able to index extrinsics. At present, Substrate provides the function of index extrinsic by hash, which is basically about to be developed. Therefore, Europa first needs to transplant this function to the Europa framework to provide the function of index extrinsic.\n\nEuropa UI needs to write related code. After each startup, scan the block data under the current workspace from block height 0 to build the index relationship between contracts, extrinsics, and accounts.\n\nFor the association of Redspot, the corresponding interface needs to be provided on the UI, and the corresponding configuration of Redspot is parsed after the call. (Similar to the association between Ganache and Truffle)\n\nTake the display of the contract address in Explorer as an example.\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115190442-98d13080-a11a-11eb-9ddc-635330a3f3de.png)\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115190483-aab2d380-a11a-11eb-977b-b853e74755f1.png)\n\nThis interface not only displays the creator of the contract and the created extrinsic, but also allows the user to upload the contract ABI and directly call the related functions of the contract on this interface. At the same time, since the extrinsics sub-page lists all the related extrinsics of the contract, after the call is completed, the user can directly view the execution status of the call extrinsic initiated by the user under the sub-page, and retrieve the execution status of the historical extrinsic at any time.\n\n#### 1.3. Europa's special founction RPC\n\nEuropa's backward of block height, and the forward of block height. These two RPCs can currently only be called directly from the outside. So this time in Europa UI, we will combine this feature with the operability of the UI.\n\nTake the Forks interface display in apps as an example:\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44688313/115190540-c28a5780-a11a-11eb-973f-19e43850d2c6.png)\n\nWhen the user wants to return to the 4455515 block, he only needs to click on the block to send a request to Europa, Europa will execute the backward logic to this block, and the block information displayed on the UI will also be returned to the block.\n\nWhen the user wants to forward to a higher block, there will be an input box on the UI interface. After the user enters, Europa can forward the block to the specified height.\n\n#### 1.4. Europa's display of state change\n\nThe current state change information of Europa only records changes in blocks (because it is directly related to StorageOverlay), and does not record Subtrie changes.\n\nTherefore, Europa UI needs to display the status changes of the current extrinsic execution on the interface, and Europa needs to continue to develop the following 2 functions:\n\n1. Europa refines the information of the state changes as a unit of extrinsic, and records it.\n2. Europa needs to store the state changes of Subtrie.\n\nAfter the development of these two functions, the UI can develop the corresponding interface for the corresponding function. In this version, only state changes similar to the hex format in Etherscan will be displayed. In future versions, we will try to display the real data after analyzing the metadata.\n\n#### 1.5. Europa's function of workspace\n\nThis part is similar to Ganache and provides an interface for creating and managing workspace in the UI. The main logic is to call the Europa and workspace-related command interfaces in the UI and switch the Europa workspace. Under the management of workspace, different spaces can be stored and switched under the same path.\n\n### 2. Europa's binary package\n\nSimilar to Ganache, in this version Europa will be distributed together with UI into binary packages for different platforms. To make binary, we use Electron to package Europa node and UI together. Therefore, this part needs to implement the following functions:\n\n1. Introduce Electron to package Europa node and UI\n2. Solve the problem of node compilation on multiple platforms, macOS, Windows and Linux.\n3. Produce CI's long-term support for the compilation and packaging of Electron's multi-platform nodes.\n\nThe difficulty in this part is to solve the compatibility problem between different platforms. After the completion of this part, Windows users will greatly reduce the difficulty of configuring the environment in the process of constructing the contract development environment and lower the threshold for contract developers.\n\n## Detailed timeline of v0.3 (May 6 - Jun 17)\n\nEuropa is divided into the following two parts in this proposal:\n\n- Europa Node: refers to the node part of Europa, that is, the content in the original [Europa](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa) repository;\n- Europa UI: refers to the interface part of Europa in this version. Europa-UI repository may be created or merged into the original Europa repository.\n\nTherefore, the plan for this development is as follows:\n\n1. **Week1-2: Refactor part of the code in Europa Node and design the corresponding interface for Europa UI. (3 developers * 2 weeks)***\n\n* Update Europa and track to the latest Substrate version, and transplant related functions of extrisic indexing;\n\n* Persist contract execution information (Contract trace, the log information of NestedRuntime above) and provide corresponding RPC to obtain this information;\n\n* Refactor the storage module of state change information, associate the state change information with the extrisic hash, persist the data and provide the corresponding RPC;\n\n* Support storage and access to Subtrie's state change information.\n\n2. **Week3-5: Build Europa UI. (3 developers * 3 weeks + 1 designer * 1 week)**\n\n* Europa UI framework;\n\n* Index the storage of Europa Node, and construct the relationship between accounts, extrinsics, and contracts, and make corresponding persistence;\n\n* Construct a visualization module of contract execution process information, and analyze the corresponding data obtained from Europa Node according to the contract Metadata information;\n\n* Build extrinsic, block, event, and detailed information interface of each part;\n\n* Associate each part with the RPC, storage and other parts provided by Europa Node.\n\n3. **Week6: Integrate and test, build the CI of Europa UI binary package, and release the binary. (3 developers * 1 week)**\n\n##  Cost of v0.3 (1 designer * week + 18 developers * weeks)\n\n- Operating activities: $3800 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per developer * week )\n- Employee payments: $35700 ($1500/$1900 per designer/developer * week)\n- Total Cost: $39500 and EMA30 price: $36.2 / DOT\n- Treasury Proposal: 1091 DOT\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Directly download the binary packages of Windows, macOS and Ubuntu from [Europa Release](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa/releases), which can be run directly on the corresponding platform.\n2. After deploying any contract through Europa and calling it through a extrinsic, the functions planned in the prototype diagram are presented:\n   1. In the associated account, you can click to jump between extrinsics and contracts. For example, click on an account to list the contracts deployed under this account and initiate invocation extrinsics, and click on the corresponding extrinsic or contract to jump to the corresponding detailed interface;\n   2. Click on a extrinsic that deploys or invokes a contract, and the detailed information of the contract execution will be listed in a visual form; click on the state interface of the extrinsic, and the state information changed during the execution of the extrinsic will be listed;\n   3. On the main page displaying block information, you can click on a block and roll back to that block, or enter a block height to forward the height of the Europa block to that block;\n3. You can create and switch between different workspaces through the workspace interface;\n4. After Europa is closed and restarted, the relationship between accounts, extrinsics and contracts before closing will be reconstructed based on the information in Europa's workspace.",

      "content": "OnFinality is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. We just launched our beta version of a shared node API Service and are already listed in the Polkadot.js app. This service expands on our core mission - to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.\n\n**This funding grant is for the ongoing running costs of two pools of Polkadot nodes for Q2 2021 (April, May, June) - this will be proposed again every three months.**\n- These costs are currently estimated at USD $9,714.86 each quarter\n- In Q1 2021 we served ([see previous proposal report](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/31)):\n    - A grand total of 666,946,005 requests over the quarter.\n    - A record 31,447,298 daily requests\n    - A rolling 7 day average at the end of the Q1 period of 9,441,503 requests each day\n- Earlier today (21st April) we just passed 1 Billion requests to this service so usage is only accelerating\n- We’ll maintain our free tier for users of 500,000 requests a day. This is so we can maintain and ensure that Polkadot is accessible by all, from the largest and most funded development teams, to the many amateurs tinkering away.\n- We’ll maintain the [one click deploy dedicated node](https://onfinality.io/dedicated_nodes) access to Polkadot for customers that need more than what our API service is intended for\n- You can access our public API service by creating a [free account for our admin portal](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183), or by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/)\n\n[You can read more about this proposal, including detailed itemised costing here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VbNyiJ1az_4khvG0yCuf2vof-yxivplgBN5rfs_OKes/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Patract’s treasury proposal for Redspot v0.4 (Wasm contract scaffold)",
      "content": "[Redspot](https://redspot.patract.io/) is one of [Patract](https://patract.io)'s Wasm contract development tool suite. Redspot's goal is to standardize the contract development process, hide the underlying compilation details of the contract, and combine the sandbox, library, API, SDK and other plugins to create a one-stop smooth contract development process. Patract had finished 3 proposals for Redspot at 4 months ago, the latest one is for v0.3 at [treasury #23](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/23), and the report is at [post #207](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/207) . We also had followed up the changes of Pallet-Contracts and ink! during the last 4 months.\n\nThere are also many parachain teams already in use of Redspot, including [Acala](https://acala.network/), [Plasm](https://www.plasmnet.io/), [Litentry](https://www.litentry.com/), [OpenSquare](http://opensquare.network/) etc. At the ParityAsia Hackathon, the [inkBridge](https://github.com/ParityAsia/hackathon-2021-spring/blob/main/teams/26-InkBridge/docs/project.md) and [SkyePass](https://github.com/ParityAsia/hackathon-2021-spring/blob/main/teams/30-SkyePass/docs/project.md) all used Patract suite (Redspot, Europa, PatraStore, etc.) to develop Wasm contract DApps from zero and win the 2nd and 3rd prizes.\n\n## Summary of Redspot’s Future Plan (old)：\n\n* v0.1(finished): Build core functions based on Truffle framework\n* v0.2(finished): Migrate to Hardhat framework to enhance the extensibility of plugins and add some features to provide a smoother development workflow\n* v0.3(finished): Promote Redspot and allow more contract developers to participate. Combine the features of Substrate to add various plug-ins, such as Waffle, Jupiter, Gas report.\n* v0.4: Provide Typescript type support for contracts (similar to Typechain), integrate multi-language SDK, etc.\n\nIn the old design of the v0.4, the plan we expected is no longer suitable for the recent situation:\n\n1. Typescript support for contracts: After discussing with Jacob (`api-contract` in `polkadot.js` is going to support Typescript), we believe that its importance is not high and does not affect the current use, so the support for contract Typescript is placed after `api-contract` supports this function.\n\n2. Integrate multi-language SDK: Since `pallet-contracts` changed the interfaces in 3.0.0 and the recent changes are huge, the Himalia project of Patract’s multi-lang SDKs currently has only the Go version to catch up with the latest changes, and the python version is not updated in time. Moreover, the java version and .NET version have not been launched yet, so the multi-lang SDKs are not yet fully prepared, so they are temporarily unable to be integrated into Redspot in this version.\n\n## Summary of Redspot’s v0.4 Plan (new)：\n\n1. Support multi-contract: In the recent updates of ink! and cargo-contracts, multi-contracts can finally be compiled normally. Therefore, Redspot will revise its support system for multiple contracts.\n2. Support docker compilation: Because of the current different environments, Wasm compilation results will be inconsistent (for example, Substrate's Runtime uses [srtool](https://github.com/paritytech/srtool) to solve this problem). On the other hand, It may be difficult to build a compilation environment under different operating systems (such as Windows), so supporting docker can solve many environmental problems.\n3. Support web interface: Although Redspot is basically a command line tool, it is not very attractive to programmers who are just getting started. Therefore, Redspot plans to introduce a contract deployment and operation interface similar to Canvas-UI, and add rich functions to this interface, strengthen the contract-related attributes in product design, and visualize some Redspot functions. And this interface can also add additional functions such as calling the polkadot{.js} extension for transaction signing (the browser extension cannot be called in the Redspot command line).\n4. Add some other plugins to enrich the Redspot ecosystem, such as support for chain types, plugins for monitoring file changes, and so on.\n\n## Detailed design of v0.4:\n\n### 1. Multi-contract support\n\nThe problem of ink! and cargo-contracts compiling multiple contracts has been corrected after the submission of [Cargo-contract PR#199](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/pull/199). Therefore, Redspot can restart the supports for multi-contract compilation (Redspot once supported the multi-contract organization structure to a certain extent, but was stopped due to the inability to compile)\n\nRedspot's multi-contract support will start from the following aspects:\n\n1. Multi-contract indexing and identification of document structure.\n2. `redspot.config.ts` supports configuration by file index.\n3. Judgment and sorting of compilation results (including the processing of compilation result of the contracts with same name)\n4. Support the use of multiple languages for mixed compile\n\nRedspot will automatically find all contract files in this directory through the configured search directory. Then compile through the configured compile tool, and finally all compile results will be output to the `artifacts` directory. At the same time, a `buildInfo` file will be generated, which records the project directory structure before compilation.\n\n### 2. docker compilation support\n\nSupporting the invocation of docker in Redspot can solve many problems related to environment setup. For related discussions, see [cargo-contract issue #188](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/issues/188) and [cargo-contract issue #184](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract/issues/184), submitted by us. Therefore, when we noticed that the cargo-contracts `dockerfile` appeared in the [CI of scripts](https://github.com/paritytech/scripts/tree/master/dockerfiles/contracts-ci-linux ), we can add related functions for Redspot about calling docker.\n\nRedspot will detect whether there is an existing docker environment. And automatically pull the docker image of the specified version. On the other hand, Redspot will maintain a docker image as the default testnet.\n\n### 3. Web interface support\n\nSince the main functions of Redspot have been relatively complete, the follow-up of Redspot will do more easy-to-use development on the product. For example, providing a contract-related UI interface to Redspot can make it easier for beginners to get started with the contract development process. On the other hand, there are some functions in Redspot that need to evoke the browser to participate in the corresponding operation (for example, call the polkadot{.js} extension to sign).\n\nAlthough parity has provided [Canvas UI](https://paritytech.github.io/canvas-ui/#/) and Developer-Contracts in [https://polkadot.js.org/apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps) , these two cannot reach our demand in terms of the specialization of the contract part. For example, Canvas-ui provides a more intuitive contract operation interface, but it does not has chain-related display information. Although apps has a more comprehensive information display, the contract call part is stronger than canvas-ui, but regardless of canvas-ui or apps are still lacking in contract-related functions, such as scanning and recording existing contracts, parsing contract parameters, and associating with the secret key in the Redspot configuration, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, like Truffle, Redspot will also be designed to be used in a production environment to deploy contracts, so Redspot needs to provide a secure way to sign transactions. For example, hardware wallets such as ledger and parity-signer can be used in the future to deploy and call contract transaction signing. In this way, developers can firstly uses a configuration similar to `development`, configures the test key to test the contract in the test environment, then switches to production environment, configures the key of the production environment to deploy the contract. In order to take care of all environments, we think that calling the browser to interact is a better method. So this time we try to integrate the call of polkadot{.js} extension.\n\nIn summary, Redspot's web interface will provide beginners with a wealth of information to start contract operations, and also integrate some operations that cannot be handled in the cli environment:\n\n1. The interface will contain basic information such as chain blocks, transactions, events, etc., and the contract operation interface is similar to Canvas-UI.\n2. The web will scan or record (different strategies according to different chains) existing contracts, and read the Redspot config environment to associate with the existing keys\n3. The web interface will display detailed information related to contract operations on the contract interface, such as gas, selector, parameter content, etc. in a contract call\n4. The web interface will visualize some operations of Redspot, such as introducing Redspot's console interface to display the log of the executed operation, or it can display test and script information, and call and execute it through the interface.\n5. When the security key is configured in Redspot's config, the web interface will need to call polkadot{.js} to sign the transaction.\n6. Support the storage query of the contract.\n7. The latest local compilation result will be uploaded automatically. It is convenient to deploy and call contracts manually.\n\n### 4. Add some other plugins\n\n4.1. Redspot-watcher\n\nCurrently Redspot executes commands such as `redspot test`, `redspot console`, etc. to check whether the contract file is modified when it is executed. Therefore, the developer needs to judge whether the contract needs to be compiled and add the `--no-compiled` command to inform redspot that the contract does not need to be compiled for this execution. Therefore, after the introduction of `redspot-watcher`, before calling the redspot runtime to execute, the `redspot-watcher` can determine whether there are file changes, so as to determine whether the compilation process needs to be invoked.\n\nredspot-watcher will modify redspot's test, run and console commands. Before each run, the file hash will be calculated and stored in the buildinfo file, and then compared with the previous file hash. If there is no change, the compilation will be skipped.\n\n4.2. Balances decimal plugin\n\nIn `web3.js`, you can use methods such as `1 ETH` to replace inputs like `10000...000`. This human-readable approach can greatly reduce the probability of making mistakes when developer write scripts and tests. However, because the precision of Ethereum is fixed, and when Substrate introduces `pallet-contracts`, the precision is determined by this chain, so the plug-in is not a static conversion, but needs to get the relevant information of the chain (decimal, symbol ) to be converted.\n\nTherefore, the plug-in will eventually achieve functions similar to the following:\n\n* '1 DOT' = '10000000000'\n* '1 KSM' = '1000000000000'\n* '1 nano’ = ’10^-9 DOT'\n\n4.3. default blockchain types plugin\n\nSince Substrate has not yet integrated `scale-info`, each chain provides `types` to support the parsing of polkadot.js. Currently, Redspot requires developers to fill in the type information in `redspot.config.ts`, which causes some troubles for developers. This plug-in obtains the types of different chains that already exist in apps, provides it to polkadot.js by default, and allows developers to override the form in `redspot.config.ts`, so that in most cases, developers do not need to worry about the need of providing polkadot.js the types.\n\nWe will discuss with polkadot apps and hope to release the @polkadot/apps-config package. Then all types provided in this package will be registered. We will also process the known contract chains with wasm functions. Maintain the types of their test chain. In this way, as long as the chain’s specversion is correctly set, there is no need to worry about the version.\n\n## Detailed timeline of v0.4（5 weeks, 4 Apr ~ 10 May）\n\n- Week 1: Implement docker support (3 developers)\n   - can specify docker image as a node.\n   - can specify docker image as the contract compiler.\n\n- Week 2: Support multi-contract compilation and redspot-watcher plugin (3 developers)\n   - Multi-contract compilation is possible\n   - The compiled product can maintain the directory structure\n   - Can detect whether the contract file has been modified, and skip the compilation if there is no modification\n\n- Week 3-4: Web interface design and development (3 developers \\* 2 weeks + 1 designer \\* 1 week)\n   - can browse to view contract events\n   - You can query the storage of the contract\n   - Can automatically upload local wasm and metadata files\n   - Automatically inject locally configured accounts\n   - Can call contracts and deploy contracts\n\n- week 5: Develop balances decimal plugin and default blockchain types plugin (3 developers)\n   - The amount can be passed in in a human-readable way.\n   - In most cases, there is no need for developers to pass in types.\n\n## Cost of v0.4 (1 designer \\* week + 15 developers \\* weeks)\n* Operating activities: $3200 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per developer * week )\n* Employee payments: $30000 ($1500/$1900 per designer/developer * week)\n* Total Cost: $33200 and monthly average: $36 / DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 922 DOT\n\n## How to verify v0.4:  Github library\n\n* Multi-contract support: able to compile the delegator contract in ink/example and the multi-contracts contract project provided by redspot\n* Support docker compilation: redspot can automatically pull and run the docker image containing cargo-contract component under the user's choice to compile the contract. The compiled structure can be moved to the `artifacts` directory, and the file permissions are correct.\n* Redspot's web interface:\n  1. Display the information and contract interface of the connected node\n  2. When a contract is deployed, the contract information and related transactions will be recorded. And can be associated with the deployer. For Europa, it can directly scan the deployed contracts and associate relevant information.\n  3. Display detailed contract operation information\n  4. The information that Redspot originally displayed on the command line can be displayed in the web interface, and redspot test cases can be called and executed from the web interface.\n  5. Able to call the polkadot.js extension to sign Redspot transactions.\n* Other plug-ins\n  * redspot-watcher: When the file is not edited, the contract will not be compiled if the relevant commands are re-executed. When the file is compiled, the compilation process will be called when re-executed\n  * Balances decimal plug-in: Use canvas, Jupiter and Europa to test, respectively test `1 Unit`, `1 DOT`, etc.\n  * default blockchain types: Connect Canvas-node and Jupiter. You no longer need to fill in types and you can send transactions normally.",

Support different Push Notification type based on user roles\n4. Basic customization support on the granularity of the Push notification\n5. Further support of the governance dashboard by implementing missing views, e.g. Referendum list and detail view, treasury detail view.\n\nDetail breakdown and its estimate can be found under the proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kZoYFv6hVodf-hTYZofNZ37ShkcNU97LXDaFlg0ouSs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n----\nReference links:\n\n- M1 Review form: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17PRwueKUVH5NuJl7xItaURnAKFtxfLWgnGSPdo4wYQY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n- M1 Intake review report: [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwhb8rnitTNx_GuRX4-Ou4EIxJv3RhgzrCxYSTs8pUs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n- Original proposal: [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/49)\n",

      "content": "Copied from [post 368](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/368)\n\n---\n\nAs you may know we developed [dotreasury](https://www.dotreasury.com/) with 2 milestones funded by Kusama. Generally now dotreasury provide a detailed accounting info and a place for community members to comment the expense. Please check following links for more details.\n- The initial post and discussions: [link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352)\n- 1st milestone work report: [link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#870d76ca-0cf3-4f87-8c94-012fccc939ea)\n- 2nd milestone proposal page: [link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/75)\n- 2nd milestone work report: [link](https://www.dotreasury.com/proposals/75#60489b5e98f65074c4c9036a)\n\nOr just check [here](https://www.dotreasury.com/projects/dotreasury) for the dotreasury project page on dotreasury. We propose to integrate polkadot to dotreasury.\n\n## Work \n### Code refactor\nNow the code is highly coupled with Kusama, and we need to refactor all the packages(scan, restful server, react app) to support multiple chains.\n- We don't plan to use 2 subdomains for kusama and polkadot separately, so the front page url may become from `/proposals `to `/[ksm|dot]/proposals`. Benefit is user don't have to login again after switching chains.\n\n### Price tracker\nSome metrics now in dotreasury are ranked by the token amount, while it will be better if we can rank them with the fiat cost. Generally we will create a price ticker and call the api of some exchanges(maybe binance, huobi, ok) maybe every minute. Finally we may show the fiat value with the proposed time price and we don't have to make it so accurate to reduce development cost.\n\n### Others\n- A polkadot archive sync node will be deployed on our server to better scan performance\n- Expense related links will be collected to show on the corresponding pages.\n- Collect the funded projects, show the list the detailed page with the timeline.\n- Listen the direct transfers to treasury address.\n- Polish. For example, we may provide a link to the staking remaining explanation pages to user to better understand the inflation. Some UX tips will also be improved.\n\n## Cost and delivery\n\nCost details\n- 3 developers * 2 weeks equivalent work = $3500 * 3 = $10500\n- Server fee for 2021.03 and 2021.04:  (8vCPU + 16GiB + 500GiB SSD + 10Mbps) * 2 = $800\n- Auxiliary work from 1 designer and 1 executive intern = $0\n\nSo the final price is $11300. Taking dot price as $30, the request dot amount is 376. \n\nWe will deliver it as soon as possible, but since we are developing other products as well, we hope deliver it no later than one month. Output will be:\nOutput: \n- Polkadot shown on [dotreasury.com](https://www.dotreasury.com/)\n- [Code repo](https://github.com/opensquare-network/dotreasury) better support multiple chains.\n\n## Possible questions\n\n1. Why not develop the M3(credit model) first, and the polkadot?\n    - We want the credit building rules are fully discussed before we finally build it. Even so, we may build it by steps. But the work of M1 and M2 is meaningful to polkadot too.\n    - Though polkadot integrated, M3 work will be done for kusama, and then polkadot when no big disputes.\n    - Better to adjust code structure first before add big new features from the view of development.\n\n2. How to discuss the credit model?  \n  We have a draft doc for it and will create a post soon for discussion. But it may be posted in the kusama polkassembly first.\n\n---\nWe are [OpenSquare](https://www.opensquare.network/) team, dedicated to facilitate the collaboration between projects and developers.",

      "content": "Hi, all councilors,\n\nPolkaWorld is submitting a proposal for polkaworld.org website development and enhancement for the Polkadot Chinese community. PolkaWorld is the largest Chinese community in China, based solely on wechat so far.\n\nProblem Description As Polkadot ecology flourishes, more content is produced by PolkaWorld. Due to the WeChat official account platform restrictions, we can only publish one article per day. As a result, we have accumulated a lot of useful content that cannot be released in time.\n\nAt present, PolkaWorld information can only be displayed on the mobile terminal of WeChat ecosystem, not on a public website, which to some extent affects more people who learn Polkadot.\n\nWith the growth and development of the community, the current content form is too restricting: we need more forms (Real-time News/live streams) to spread the content of Polkadot and Substrate.\n\nThe deliverable of this proposal is the enhancement of the website on polkaworld.pro, which will allow us to post content at any time and add a section of Real-time News and videos to enrich the form of content, providing the community with real-time information.\n\nWe requested 647.07 DOT (Rate: 34.37 USD/DOT based on a EMA30 rate on [subscan](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)) for milestone 1 ~ milestone 3.\n\nYou can get more details about the milestones and budget [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nxJNfGgLoiZcbmqpTCDD5TstCxAPUlgnX1a28Byd3pE/edit#)\n\nPls feel free to feedback me if you have any confuse/questions!\n\nMany thanks!",

      "content": "**Proponent:** 142hWpBmGsePS1tSopxg4JWaRirGgVpZubz5h251m31KJXdf\n\n**Date:** 03/09/21\n\n**Requested DOT:** 2380 DOTs for Milestones 1-3 - 100% of the DOTs will be distributed to developers as incentives. Figment retains 0 DOTs for operational costs as part of this proposal.\n\n**Short description:** [Figment](https://figment.io/) is creating a proposal to request DOTs to be used as incentives to grow the Polkadot developer ecosystem via its platforms Figment Learn and DataHub. [Learn](https://learn.figment.io/) is the education and onboarding platform for developers interested in Web 3 development. With Learn, developers gain access to the most comprehensive developer portal which standardizes documentation across networks and offers in-depth practical tutorials to help them get to the next level.\n\nTutorials can be completed seamlessly with [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up) which provides easy access to the protocols via our highly available full node infrastructure and suite of middleware. Developers then get to build and scale their DApps for free using the DataHub infrastructure.\n\n**Original proposal doc:**\n\n[Visit this link for the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkgnwLhjVCCrKY43uRgzg6vFI6yN_aoD_TCxBdkNAg8/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)",

However, based on our experience after M8.1 and M8.2 we must admit that we underestimated M8.3. Especially the test fixtures are more laborsome than we anticipated. We can still not use `cargo test` for our SGX enclave code, so we have to wrap everything with custom commands and mocking is only partially possible leading to more end2end tests which are harder to debug. Moreover, we became aware of [#208](https://github.com/scs/substraTEE-worker/issues/208) which needs to be fixed.\n\n#### cost and timeline\n\nOur initial estimate for M8.3 was CHF 39'200.- but we have to adjust to **48'400 CHF** (+23%).\n\nWe currently have 1.3 FTE reserved for this and intend to **deliver within 9 weeks** after this motion passes.\n\nDOT moving average MA(25)@1day today is 32.0 USDT on binance\nUSDT is 0.9302 CHF according to coinmarketcap\n\nalong previous proposals, we'd add a 10% premium for volatility risk.\n\nWe therefore request 48400*1.1/32.0/0.9302 = **1788.59 DOT**\n\n#### reviews \n\nexternal reviews of our previous milestones M8.1 and M8.2: [review1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EZgKLt1SbOsXwGi2NNnEAhjdyTrEUOttC__k4D6dVwg/edit#gid=1901352075), [review2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sC1Jxy0mKSjUsiPfjc_SO3rwsyjUwV1jT4VCVJbrdrI/edit#gid=1534875011) \n\nplease [tip](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/tip/0xc5f28e61c17ad452006e6150532a60c95c3936e2046b9b4d38269bd518b2b8f5) & [tip](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/tip/0xe48b661e5c97caf176e5ac401dc71c01922a3adfb69f6d0378ed103ced0c54c6) the reviewers\n\n",

      "title": "Stylo - an offline wallet based on Parity Signer",
      "content": "This is the on chain proposal corresponding to the  discussion [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/315](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/315)\n\n### Proposal: Stylo - offline wallet\n- Date: 15.02.2021\n- Requested DOT: 159 DOTs\n\n## Short description:\nStylo is an offline wallet that brings user friendliness to the front seat. It allows storing funds offline. Any interaction with the online world happens by scanning QR codes. Transactions are scanned, using the phone’s camera. They can then be reviewed and signed offline, and finally transmitted to an online wallet by scanning a QR code displayed on the phone, by a computer webcam. Stylo means pen in french.\n\n## Context of the proposal\nMany readers of this proposal will know [Parity Signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer). The idea of using a spare phone totally offline to store private-keys and scan transactions with QR code is simply great. In the past year however, Parity Signer has become increasingly complex to use. It targets power users, with 10s of accounts and is heavily forcing the hand toward the use of derivation paths. This is a concept that most users do not master. The idea to create a new application came from conversations with external users through the support channel of Parity Signer. Additionally, Parity Signer is currently missing critical features such as the ability to review a transaction, effectively putting its user at risk.\n\nStylo will be based on Parity Signer, refactoring big parts of the app to make it simple to grasp for its users. The idea is to have a flow similar to the one in Polkadot-js Extension, where all accounts are visible right away (see mocks below). It will be available on Android as an app, and on the Play store for testing. Why not on iOS you may ask? Because I do not have any Mac, or any iOS device. Stylo, just like Parity Signer, will be built using React-Native, therefore, it can be made available on Apple devices in the future, with (hopefully) minimal efforts.\n\n## About the developer\nI’m Thibaut Sardan, I have been a Parity employee in the past and worked on Parity Signer. I am dedicated to making this space easier to navigate for new and current users. \n\n## What this proposal is for\n- An app (see mocks below) available as apk (Github) and on the Android Play store\n- Support for DOT, KSM, any Substrate chain and ETH. \n\n## Work to be done\n![](https://i.imgur.com/56KcXBq.png)\n\n## Conditions of payment\nAmount requested: 159 DOTs\nCorresponding to ~3180$, or 60$/h for a developer or designer, and 100$/tester.\nPrice calculated based on the average price [in the past 1 month](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=period&from=DOT&to=USD&startDate=2021-01-15&endDate=2021-02-15): 1 DOT = 20$\n\nThis is a minimal milestone, aiming at bringing the app live asap and measuring the community’s reaction/adoption. I will build it in my free time. Some features are already implemented, such as the details view.\n\n## Features and ideas that can be added in subsequent milestones:\n- support for simple message signing\n- support for derivation in a (similar way than Polkadot-js extension)\n- unlock with fingerprint instead of pin\n- metadata update over QR code\n\n## Mocks\n![](https://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1613482893.jpg)",

Figment retains 0 DOTs for operational costs as part of this proposal.\n\n**Short description:** [Figment](https://figment.io/) is creating a proposal to request DOTs to be used as incentives to grow the Polkadot developer ecosystem via its platforms Figment Learn and DataHub. [Learn](https://learn.figment.io/) is the education and onboarding platform for developers interested in Web 3 development. With Learn, developers gain access to the most comprehensive developer portal which standardizes documentation across networks and offers in-depth practical tutorials to help them get to the next level.\n\nTutorials can be completed seamlessly with [DataHub](https://datahub.figment.io/sign_up) which provides easy access to the protocols via our highly available full node infrastructure and suite of middleware. Developers then get to build and scale their DApps for free using the DataHub infrastructure.\n\n**Original proposal doc:**\n\n[Visit this link for the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GkgnwLhjVCCrKY43uRgzg6vFI6yN_aoD_TCxBdkNAg8/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)",

We have 1.3 FTE ready to work on this and we expect to deliver within 3 weeks after our proposal has passed approval.\n\nCurrent exchange rates:\n\nDOT moving average MA(25)@1day today is 18.12 USDT on binance\n\nUSDT is 0.8945 CHF according to coinmarketcap\n\nEven though the current market is in our favor, we think a volatility risk margin of 10% is justified.

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI would like to submit another proposal to cover PolkaStats operation costs for Polkadot for the period 21.12.2020 to 21.03.2021\n\n### MOTIVATION\n\nPolkaStats is a Substrate block explorer aiming to provide the best staking and economic data for both validators and nominators. It helps both types of users by providing comprehensive metrics, charts and utilities to improve their knowledge and performance.\nPolkaStats is one of the projects that was born in La Colmena, a crypto community based in Sevilla, southern Spain. The community aims to incentivize content-creation in Spanish for Polkadot, Kusama and other blockchain projects and, as supporters of open source culture, develop software to contribute to the ecosystem. The organization also acts like an incubator that helped create blockchain business models like DragonStake or Delega Networks validators.\n\nOne year after starting the project in **La Colmena** it is certain to say that PolkaStats development also helped us learn and understand more about the Substrate framework and substrate-based chains. \n\nAlthough there are currently already some very good Substrate explorers in the ecosystem, PolkaStats has a different perspective to offer in order to increase diversity among the existing solutions. PolkaStats differentiates from other explorers in:\n\n1. Focusing on Proof of Stake chains only.\n2. Being a Javascript based block explorer (both frontend and backend)\n3. Utilising Vue.js / Nuxt.js frameworks used in frontend, with a low learning curve.\n4. Allowing Incipient wallet functionalities\n\n### SOME POLKADOT METRICS\n\nGoogle Analytics metrics of the Polkadot version of PolkaStats in the last month:\n\n- **8.100** unique users\n- **13.000** sessions\n- Visitors from **133** countries\n\n### PREVIOUS APPROVED PROPOSAL\n\nThe details of the last proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPrevious proposal discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/290). \n\nLast treasury motion, executed at block#1,694,500 (Sep 21, 2020):\n\n- [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/12](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/12)\n- [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/22](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/22)\n\n\n### SPENDING PROPOSAL FOR PERIOD 21.12.2020 to 21.03.2021\n\nPolkaStats aims to submit this spending proposal in the following terms:\n\n- New **3 month period**, covering operational expenses **from 21.12.2020 to 21.03.2021**, which totals to **37,08 DOT**.\n- DOT conversion rate of 1 DOT = 18,81 $ (15,70 €) using MA(99) AVG from  [https://www.binance.com/en/trade/DOT_USDT](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/DOT_USDT)\n- The funds will be used to pay the servers we rent to Hetzer and Digital Ocean in order to operate PolkaStats for Polkadot and Westend network (shared with Kusama).\n\n\n### FULL PROPOSAL DETAILS\n\nYou can find the full proposal details, including monthly budget [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18T0U-dJq_UtmK-K1YbGs4R49wVM1hHWlK1RPf5DibqE).\n\n",

      "content": "OnFinality is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Polkadot/Substrate community. We just launched our beta version of a shared node API Service and are already listed in the Polkadot.js app. This service expands on our core mission - to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.\n\nSetting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult and time consuming, and requires a level of server development expertise that many don’t have. We're applying for funding for the ongoing costs of our free public API service for Polkadot so that everyone can access a public pool of managed Polkadot nodes.\n\n**This funding grant is for the ongoing running costs of this pool of Polkadot nodes for Q1 2021 (January/February/March) - this will be proposed again every three months. These costs are currently estimated at USD $1,101.60 a month**\n\n**More Info**\n- We just served over 3.2 million requests in a single day on the 6th of January 2021 to our free API service\n- There is an additional separate funding grant for improvements to the API service that further scale the service. The details of this future grant are here.\n- We’ll maintain our free tier for users of 500,000 requests a day while funds to run these nodes remain. This is so we can maintain and ensure that Polkadot is accessible by all, from the largest and most funded development teams, to the many amateurs tinkering away.\n- In the future, we may provide additional paid tiers of API Service usage above those 500,000 daily requests at different costs structures\n- We’ll maintain the [one click deploy dedicated node](https://onfinality.io/dedicated_nodes) access to Polkadot for customers that need more than what our API service is intended for\n- You can access our public API service by[ creating a free account for our admin portal](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183), or by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/)\n\nYou can read more on this treasury funding proposal at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u47lMl_uuDHPL18rzfHn8F3Yt3_mT5B2guqqQUUl04/edit?usp=sharing\n](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10u47lMl_uuDHPL18rzfHn8F3Yt3_mT5B2guqqQUUl04/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can also read about our funding proposal for the improvements to the scalability of our service [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/218).\n\nAdditionally, you can talk to us on Telegram at [t.me/onfinality](t.me/onfinality)",

      "title": "@Oneblock Substrate Hackathon Proposal",
      "content": "Proponent: 15UkSSYN7pkPSdiHSzjeMZSi1sKmukCkijFrZ8aWaKudCwZV\n\nProposal date: 29.12.2020\n\nRequested DOT: 5786\n\nOneBlock hopes to organize and host a top-quality Hackathon event for Substrate developers and like to get financial sponsorship from the Polkadot treasury. It plans to attract Substrate technology enthusiasts in China to develop and showcase their cool ideas of the Polkadot ecosystem projects and build more high-quality projects based on Substrate, in order to enrich the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**We are asking for a one-time payment of 5786 DOTs to hold the Substrate Hackathon（30days online Hackathon + 2days offline Demo Day）for polkadot ecosystem.\n\nWe will hold the hackathon in Q1 of 2021.**\n\n### Our plan of the Substrate Hackathon are as below:\n\n**1.Background introduction:**\n\nOneBlock is one of the earliest and largest blockchain developer communities in China. It is a technical education community for Chinese blockchain technology enthusiasts and developer users. It provides systematic technology-related original content, live broadcasts, and professional courses and offline workshops which allow blockchain technology developers to obtain knowledge about blockchain technology in the easiest, most convenient, and nearly zero-cost way. At present, the community has gathered technology enthusiasts from Google, Facebook, UIUC, Oracle, Microsoft, Peking University, Tsinghua University, BAT and other Chinese and American higher institutions and has trained 8,000 international blockchain technology talents for the global blockchain industry.\n\nAt the same time, OneBlock is also Parity’s operating partner in China and the exclusive partner of Substrate technology development courses. It is committed to popularizing Substrate technical knowledge and cultivating Substrate ecological developers. OneBlock sent 24 teams to participate in the first official hackathon of Kusama and Polkadot ecology from June to August this year, and one team successfully won the second prize.\n\nSince its establishment in 2018, OneBlock has launched 6 Substrate development courses, and cultivated more than 500 Substrate technology developers. Most of the founders, CTOs, and core developers of the early Polkadot ecological projects are from OneBlock. In the future, OneBlock will continue to support Substrate ecological developers and entrepreneurs, continue to explore and help high-quality Substrate ecological projects, so as to promote the development of China's Substrate technology ecosystem.\n\n**2.What issue will the treasury funds tackle**\n\nTwo aspects: 2.1 Regarding the Polkadot ecology, although Polkadot is already a well-known project in China, most developers know little about how to deeply participate in Substrate-related technologies and the Polkadot ecology, what individuals or teams can do and how to do it based on Substrate/Polkadot. In addition, there are not many innovative projects in Polkadot ecology, and the growth rate is not up to speed. 2.2 Regarding developers in the current ecosystem, OneBlock discovered a problem from the existing Substrate technical courses: In each course, OneBlock has nearly 100 developer students who have completed the Substrate development technology course, but they cannot effectively transform the theoretical knowledge learned through the 1-month online course into a practical project that can be implemented. Through feedback from some graduate students, OneBlock hopes to increase the practical competition after the course and encourage the students to form teams for practical projects.\n\nTherefore, OneBlock proposes to hold a Hackthon at the end of the Substrate course in 2020. This would allow the developers to convert the Substrate knowledge learned in the course into creative ideas and ideas, and actually implement these ideas with formed teams through a real Hackathon. This will guide students of Substrate technical courses to actively participate in the development of Substrate ecological projects and gain practical development experience.\n\nOneBlock hopes to combine theoretical knowledge courses with practical challenges to inspire developers to create more innovative and interesting products for the Substrate ecosystem, contribute to the Substrate technology, and ultimately deliver high-quality projects to W3F and Web3 training camps.\n\n**3.What is the proposed solution?**\n\n**3.1 Basic information** about the Hackathon From November 2020 to February 2021, OneBlock will launch Substrate Hackathon through a combination of online and offline forms. The theme of this Hackathon is Substrate and Polkadot related technology. We will allow Substrate developers and Substrate technical course graduates to hack up on their brilliant ideas. This is just the first step: OneBlock plans to continuously organize and host Hackathons in different cities in China to source and promote the coolest Substrate hacker natoin-wide non-stop!\n\n**3.2 Theme: **Substrate Ecological Hackathon Sunrise This is the first hackathon event of Substrate ecology in China. Get ready to build tools, Dapps, etc. based on the Polkadot ecology, and use your unique creative problem-solving skills! At the same time, as the final examination of the Substrate technical course, everyone can fully practice the technical knowledge learned in the course and complete their graduation works. Together, we can contribute to a fair, secure, and adaptive Web3.0. China's largest Substrate developer competition event, Polkadot eco-entrepreneurs and geeks gather in Hangzhou/Shanghai Sufficient preparation time of 30 days online + 48 hours offline hack challenge, there is plenty of room to shine\n\n**3.3** Targeted developer groups Teams who want to create projects based on Substrate and solve real-world problems Teams who want funding, technology, community support and incubation Teams with experience in the development of blockchain projects based on Ethereum / EOS Those who have skills in blockchain development, front-end development, Dapp development, design, operation, business, etc. and are interested in innovation\n\n**3.4 Competition Format:** A team of 1-5 people can participate in the competition, you can form your own team first, or you can register first and form team online later Questions will be announced 30 days before the game to allow for preparation, 48 hours of live Hack 15-minute final results display, score consists of the judges’ votes (80%) + on-site hacker votes (20%)\n\n**3.5 Technology sharing and Q&A:**\n\nSubShare online sharing In order to help Chinese developers and users better understand the ecology of Substrate and Polkadot, OneBlock will carry out a series of related online live sharing activities. Four events will be organized during the competition. Speakers range from KOLs such as the ecological project CTO and the Substrate course ambassador. They are a group of strategists and developers who truly love and hope to contribute to parachains and bridges. They will organize and share what they have learned. In addition, OneBlock will also organize the content into videos and articles after each sharing event and publish them on the public accounts on wechat, bilibili and Top10+ blockchain media platforms, so that more people can understand the Substrate ecology.\n\nOffline Sub Workshop Sub Workshop is a technology sharing column provided by OneBlock and Parity engineers to provide cutting-edge technology introduction and technology concept sharing to developers. Sub Workshop provides developers with professional technical guidance, helping developers to gradually solve the technical difficulties of Substrate in Hackathon, so as to achieve successful project development.\n\nOnline Q&A Sub Office Hour The Q&A live broadcast is aimed at the specific questions that developers have during the development process. It collects the problems encountered by the developers during the project development process through the community, and answers them through Sub office Hour.\n\nTechnical article output Sub Article In the process of providing technical guidance and sharing to developers, OneBlock will precipitate valuable technical topics and produce technical articles for developers. These articles will be uploaded to social media to attract more Substrate developers.\n\n**3.6 Competition Categories：** This hackathon is open to individuals and teams and is divided into three main categories: Construct tools based on the Polkadot ecology: Use Substrate to build the Polkadot ecological tools, enrich the infrastructure of the Polkadot ecology, and provide a foundation for the construction of DAPP. Build DAPP: Use Substrate to build a creative DAPP based on Polkadot or Polkadot ecological parachain Open Hack: Try everything possible! Be creative and carry out disruptive innovations that will surprise us. Entries can be about test suites, visualization, Wasm interoperability, etc. Anything is possible.\n\n**3.7 Expected recruitment scope Publication viewers: **10,000+ developers Registration link clicks: 6000+ Final successful enrollment: 100 Substrate developers\n\n**3.8 Publicity channels and methods：**\n\na. Establish multiple channels for simultaneous promotion OneBlock’s own channel promotion China's TOP10 media partners and community assisted promotion Form a team of course ambassadors to assist in the promotion Partnership with China's major university blockchain association\n\nb. Create multiple forms of publicity Course introduction poster Article Online live sharing Offline workshop\n\nc. Expected scope of recruitment Publication viewers: 10,000+ developers Registration link clicks: 6000+ Final successful enrollment: 100 Substrate developers\n\n**3.9 Scoring dimensions：** All entries will be scored in the following four dimensions: Business value (40%): solve problems and have business prospects Completion (20%): The code has implementation logic, not just a concept Innovative (20%): creative and breakthrough Technical difficulty (20%): The technology used has a certain threshold\n\nThe specific execution plan must have clearly executable and quantifiable milestones Important process and time node arrangement: Team registration period: January 10th-February 20th Online Co-coding Period: January 10th-February 17th Preliminary selection shortlisted time: February 18th-February 19th Offline Hack and review time (offline): February 20-February 21 Winner announcement time: Based on the judgement of the on-site jury and Hackers’ vote, the winners will be announced on February 21st.

      "content": "This motion proposes `16iPbcL3NrdYWNVZ8uYmonmBuVmuSbbQLL5ECBvDxcSNyLPT` as curator of the band bounty funded this week. \n\nThe candidacy, a multisig composed by **Bette Chen** (co-founder of Acala and lead of Product design), **Katie Butler** (Marketing director of Moonbeam) **Iggy Albero** (the designer behind the current Polkadot and Kusama’s brand) and **Kaye Han** (head of marqomms division), was proposed by Katie this week based on the parties’ expertise and experience with the brand. \n\nWhile no reward is expected for the effort, the motion is opened with a 1 dot fee for the curator to showcase the bounty mechanism, being this the first bounty on Polkadot. **The motion will be up for vote for 6 days, please everyone vote at your convenience.** The bounty’s scope of work can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/50). \n\n-------\n\nKatie's msg submitting the multisig candidacy below, shared on Direction Channel in on 30.12.2020:\n\n\"Hello Council members!\n\nFor Polkadot's first-ever bounty, proposed by Koto Studio, we are excited to present our candidacy as the bounty curator. As outlined in the proposal, the final deliverables must take into consideration the wide-ranging perspectives of the Polkadot community. Thus, we believe this proposal is best served by a multi-sig curator composed of individuals with professional brand development expertise and deep roots in the Polkadot ecosystem. Here is a brief on the individuals that are part of this proposed multi-sig:\n\n**Bette Chen, co-founder of Acala and Laminar**, leads product design and development on token economic models. Bette has decades of experience in product management and has led her teams to much success in the Polkadot ecosystem and blockchain industry at large.\n\n**Katie Butler is the Director of Marketing at PureStake & Moonbeam**. She is responsible for leading her team on marketing and communications for the smart contract parachain. Prior to Moonbeam, Katie gained extensive experience in a wide range of technology companies.\n\n**Iggy Albero, from Web3 Foundation**, is the designer who created Polkadot's beloved logo and many other brand assets. Iggy also designed the Kusama brand and has worked on many design projects with a focus on visualising blockchain concepts, technology, and data.\n\n**Kaye Han, from Parity Technologies**, heads the marcomms division whose design, marketing, and web teams deeply interact with the Polkadot brand on a daily basis. Beyond the blockchain space, Kaye has worked with global brands such as IDEO, Nike, Starbucks, and more.\n\nWhile no reward is expected for our efforts on this historic bounty proposal, to showcase the power of social coordination on a blockchain network, we propose a symbolic 1 DOT as the curator fee. We believe this bounty is a huge milestone for Polkadot and hope that our expertise, experience and enthusiasm presents us as a great candidate.\n\n**Mutli-sig Address:** 16iPbcL3NrdYWNVZ8uYmonmBuVmuSbbQLL5ECBvDxcSNyLPT\" \n\n-------",

      "content": "> Note: This treasury proposal is only for **milestone 1**, we list all milestones here only to provide an holistic overview of our vision and better context for understanding our proposed solution.\n\nProposer: (Hanwen/Litentry) `14zExx2SkY7j9HLeBmuz91o3KfSroSAFRFGNtBnEkYNC492U`\n\nDate: 17.12.2020\n\nRequested DOT: 6132\n\n[Original proposal on GitHub](https://github.com/hanwencheng/gists/blob/master/Litentry/governance-app.md)\n\n[Discussion on Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/217)\n\n\n**Short description**: Governance-focused Mobile App for substrate-based networks\n\n---\n\nIn this proposal, we raise the idea of building a governance-focused app with cross-wallet support, which could encourage the user to take part in various on-chain governance actions and be able to interact with on-chain governance activities in a low friction manner, thus improving the on-chain governance engagement.\n\n## 1. Context of Proposal\n\nHanwen Cheng was the former product owner of [Parity Signer](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-signer). He has rich experience in building mobile and web applications, also very familiar with Substrate-based tools. Now he is working for [Litentry Technologies GmbH](https://www.litentry.com/), a technology company focusing on building a [cross-chain identity aggregator](https://litentry.medium.com/why-we-need-cross-chain-identity-on-polkadot-d59a90c9329c), which includes the substrate-based networks and related tools. The team has solid substrate development experience and specialization in mobile engineering.\n\nAggregated identity means an identity linked with accounts from different blockchains and off-chain applications/services, which represent the owner behind the accounts, and further present the owner's credibility and reputation in various aspects. \n\nIn this proposal, we present a governance app. It could \n\n* facilitate the governance process by lowering the participation friction\n* increase user engagement by providing clear UI/UX for interactions \n* allow users to subscribe to remote **Push Notifications** for relevant topics\n* provide richer information related to the identity across different substrate-based chains\n* serve as a basis for more incentive mechanisms\n\n*Polkadot* currently employs *Phragmén Method* to equalize stake holder's voting power in elections. In our eyes, we see a future where the reputation of identity also plays a vital role in calculating the voting power of elections.\n\n## 2. Problem statement:\n\nThere are currently a few issues when it comes to on-chain governance on *Polkadot* and *Kusama*:\n\n1. Low Voting Participation Rate: Currently, the on-chain governance participation rate is quite low, even in the case of controversial decisions (such as  *Kusama* redenomination, in which only about 10% of stakeholders participate in the vote).\n\n2. Missing Identity Governance Stats: When voting for the council members, it is hard to know who, from all councilors, has made the most contributions to the ecosystem and who has participated the most in the discussions. Currently, there is no dashboard to show on-chain governance stats of identity. Also, on [Polkadot.js Apps](http://polkadot.js.org/apps/) and [Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/), the identity tooltip is limited to certain fields. Therefore richer information is needed to be shown when users browse and participate in governance. Opensquare has made a [proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352) on *Kusama* about the treasury reputation recording system, and this system is currently in the web app side.\n\n3. After investigating the wallets listed on https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-wallets, currently only [Polkawallet](https://polkawallet.io/) natively supports for governance module. The rest wallets either use integrated governance DApp in a WebView, or do not even have governance module integration at the moment. Furthermore, each mobile app has its own governance UI. The engineering power is wasted and lacks interoperability.\n\nImtoken |  Math Wallet | Polkawallet\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:---|\n![imtoken](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/gists/master/Litentry/imgs/GovernanceImtoken.jpeg)  |  ![mathwallet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/gists/master/Litentry/imgs/GovernanceMath.jpeg)| ![polkawallet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/gists/master/Litentry/imgs/GovernancePolkawallet.jpeg)\n\n4. Current state of *Polkadot.js Apps* is mostly catered for experienced users or developers. Besides, it exposes low-level APIs to interact with substrate-based blockchains, which introduces frictions for end-users to interact. \n\n5. There is no mobile application that could relay the transactions from other wallets on the *Polkadot* ecosystem. And only a few mobile wallets like *Parity Signer* and [Math Wallet](https://mathwallet.org/) could sign the transactions from *Polkadot.js Apps*. The wallet ecosystems are relatively closed.\n\n6. When Council submits emergency proposals, councilors must view and react to the proposals in a timely fashion, but there is currently no efficient way to notify the councilors in case of emergency proposals. This is especially challenging since councilors are in different time zones.\n\n## 3. Proposal Objective/solution/s:\n\n### Objective\n\nWe want to create a governance mobile application that could:\n\n1. Offer native governance support integration and Polkassembly off-chain discussion.\n2. Improve user engagement by allowing them to receive and customize **Push Notification** of governance-related updates.\n3. Provide participants with good governance statistics and gamification scores to incentivize users to join governance.\n4. Provide the option to notify App users (in the form of **Push Notification**) for emergency proposals. The notification itself can be customized with a basic ruleset (e.g., users who logged in as Councilors or Technical Councilors members in case of a proposal have to be processed urgently)\n\n|Current Governance Ecosystem| Targeting Governance Ecosystem|\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n|![imtoken](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/gists/master/Litentry/imgs/governanceBefore.png)|![mathwallet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/gists/master/Litentry/imgs/governanceNow.png)|\n\n### Solutions / Milestones\n\n#### Milestone 1: Integrate identity registration\n1.1 Offer user the capability to verify Identity (e.g., email, riot) in App.\n1.2 Provide a registrar service to verify the submitted identity automatically.\n1.3 Display a basic dashboard of governance-related activities for this identity\n1.4 Display Identity registration Status on *Polkadot*/*Kusama*.\n\n#### Milestone 2: On-chain governance basic support\n2.1 Support native governance actions on *Polkadot*/*Kusama* with good information hierarchy and UX/UI.\n2.2 Allow users to subscribe to governance-related updates via Push Notification to improve engagement. (e.g., when a new proposal is up, or it is either being accepted or rejected.)\n2.3 Build further on a governance dashboard, allowing the user to see governance-related statistics of any Account. (e.g., if a user is browsing a proposal and wants to learn more about the **proposer**)\n2.4 Support role-based Push Notification subscription of a certain type of on-chain events.\n\n\n#### Milestone 3: Identity Dashboard and customization\n3.1 Allow users to customize further **Push Notification** settings to receive the tailored governance-related digest.\n3.2 Show identity on-chain governance states on *Polkadot*/*Kusama*.(Extends on Openquare's treasury [reputation data](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352))\n3.3 Allow users to participate in discussions from Polkassemby natively in app.\n3.4 Further enrich governance dashboard's data of an Identity from different chains.\n3.5 Interact with other wallet app and sign the transactions with inter-app communication (work together with WalletConnect [Specification v2](https://docs.walletconnect.org/v/v2.0.0-alpha/tech-spec)).\n\n\n#### Milestone 4 Governance Score and Lottery integration\n4.1 Be able to do on-chain governance actions on different networks.\n4.2 Build further on Push notification touchpoint to increase engagement\n4.3 Build further on the main dashboard to highlight important proposal or event for the community\n4.4 Integrate substrate [lottery](https://hackmd.io/68rduBydTEy4X-ULevd90g) support.\n\n### Network Benefit\n\n* Have more users share their voice on important elections. (`vote`)\n* Encourage users to register on-chain identity. (`identity`, `setIdentity`, `requestJudgement`)\n* Have users change/update their validator nominations on a regular schedule. (`nominate`)\n* Encourage brainstorming of ideas in future updates and changes (`propose_bounty`)\n* Encourage user to use tipping system (`tip`, `reportAwesome`)\n* Have more users (change their) backing of (candidate) council members (`electionPhragmen`, `vote`)\n* Encourage users to use lottery modules and join vote (`buy_tickets`, `vote`)\n* Encourage users to join the off-chain discussion on Polkassembly.\n\n## 4. Why Polkadot Network.\n\nThe governance on *Polkadot* affects most users, and it is of the most important features among all substrate-based networks.\n\nThe technical implementation does not have much difference when we compare *Polkadot*/*Kusama* or Substrate-based networks. So we are doing the work firstly on *Polkadot* and *Kusama*, and then it will be further extended to all the substrate-based networks.\n\n ## 5. Payments and Conditions\n \n The total estimate time is 438 hours, estimated with 1 designer and 2 developers in mind. In the case of discrepancies of our time estimate (either over or underestimate), we will be revising it in future milestones.\n \n It is calculated with an hourly rate of 70 USD/hour and using DOT 5 USD/Unit as a reference for the total dollar value of 28210 USD.\n \nThere are 4 milestones in total, and the detailed information of each milestone is listed in the table below,\n\n| Milestone | Task

      "title": "Patract Hub's treasury proposal for Europa (sandbox) v0.2",
      "content": "This is copy from https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/189\n \nGithub: https://github.com/patractlabs/europa\n\nEuropa is a sandbox environment that runs `FRAME Contracts pallet`, and it is also a framework that provides a sandbox environment for Substrate Runtime. Therefore, developers can use the executable files compiled by Europa to debug the `ink!` contract, and they can also use the library provided by Europa as a framework to implement a sandbox environment for the Runtime in their Substrate project.\n\nEuropa provides the minimal service components that support Runtime to package and execute transactions normally. Therefore, although Europa can be regarded as a chain node, this node has no consensus system, no network connection, and only retains the Runtime executor, RPC and some other necessary services. In addition, as a WASM contract running sandbox, we modified `FRAME Contracts pallet` to provide more detailed debugging information, including contract execution process information (in `FRAME Contracts` layer) and WASM execution information (in WASMI execution layer).\n\nIn order to facilitate debugging and add new features, Europa removed all WASM components in Substrate, so any `std` code can be added to the entire system of Europa to meet experimental requirements.\n\n## Europa's Future development plans\n\n~~v0.1: Have an independent runtime environment to facilitate more subsequent expansion directions.~~\n\nv0.2: Modify at `FRAME Contracts pallet` level to provide more information。\n\nv0.3: Improve the development experience, strengthen collaboration with other tools, and extend the sandbox to be compatible with other runtime modules。\n\nWe submitted a proposal for [Europa v0.1](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/102) two months ago, and wrote the [treasury report](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/166). In v0.1, Europa has completed the basic framework of the Runtime sandbox, removed unnecessary modules related to the chain, removed the functional components of WASM, and provided many necessary tool components as a sandbox.\n\n## Detailed design of Europa v0.2\n\n### 1. Fork `FRAME Contracts Pallet` to provide more debug information\n\nAlthough `FRAME Contracts pallet` has been iterative, its error messages are not friendly to contract development. Although in Substrate's [Commit #6773](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/6773) and [Commit #7017](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7017), the error handling of contracts has been improved a lot, but these error messages are mainly concentrated in the `FRAME Contracts pallet` layer, missing a lot of error information about WASM execution layer. For example, WASM execution crash errors or out-of-bounds errors do not have detailed information. For example, this part of the code in Substrate [`frame/contracts/src/wasm/runtime.rs:LL367`](https://github.com/paritytech/ substrate/blob/master/frame/contracts/src/wasm/runtime.rs#L367)\n\n```rust\n\t\t// Any other kind of a trap should result in a failure.\n\t\tErr(sp_sandbox::Error::Execution) | Err(sp_sandbox::Error::OutOfBounds) =>\n\t\t\tErr(Error::<E::T>::ContractTrapped)?\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAs shown above, because `sp_sandbox::Error` only provides three types of errors, and these error types do not contain more detailed reasons for this error. For example, developers only know that it is an execution error of `Execution` and an out of bounds error of `OutOfBounds`, And all have been converted into `ContractTrapped`. Therefore, the reason for the internal crash of the contract cannot be known to the outside world. In our fork development of `FRAME Contracts pallet`, we will supplement and perfect this short board.\n\nIn the execution environment of the contract `wasmi`, all error messages are discarded. For example, in this part of the code in Substrate [`primitives/sandbox/with_std.rs:L287`](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/primitives/sandbox/with_std.rs#L284), The information of `_err` of `Err(_err)` is discarded.\n\n```rust\nmatch result {\n    Ok(None) => Ok(ReturnValue::Unit),\n    Ok(Some(val)) => Ok(ReturnValue::Value(val.into())),\n    Err(_err) => Err(Error::Execution),\n}\n```\n\nAlthough the `debug_message` field is provided in the contract RPC call `contracts_call` to provide the function of returning more information before the formal execution in the future, more detailed information still needs some customized development to provide. For details, please refer to the discussion in [ink! issue #589](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/589#issuecomment-731745755). Therefore, the developers cannot well know the error information in the current `FRAME Contracts` layer and the `wasmi` interpretor during the execution of the contract.\n\nOn the other hand, when a contract calls a contract, the current `FRAME Contracts pallet` cannot tell the developer which layer of the contracts has a problem. In other words, there is no `Contract Stack trace` information about the execution process of the contract in the `FRAME Contracts pallet`.\n\nIn addition, as a tool for contract debugging, the contract module lacks a lot of display for internal execution information, such as displaying the value of the `selector` called by the current contract and the parameters passed by the contract. On the other hand, we can count the gas consumption of the contract calling the contract (not the gas consumption of a single contract, but the gas consumption during the execution), and the number of times of reading, writing, storing, and accessing other interfaces.\n\n### 2. 2. Provide log printing during contract execution\n\nDevelopers need to know some variables or information during the execution of the contract. The easiest way is to print logs during the contract execution. \n\nFor printing logs information, currently `seal_println(_ctx, _ptr: u32, _len: u32)` is provided in `FRAME Contracts pallet`, and `::ink_env::debug_println()` is provided in `ink!`. This group of functions plus `ink_prelude::format!` can be combined into a feature similar to the `println!` macro in rust to print information to the console. Therefore, after the debugging switch (flag) of the contract is turned on, the following printing can be provided:\n\n```rust\nlet s = ::ink_prelude::format!(\"print in contract:{}\", 1_u32);\n::ink_env::debug_println(&s); // == println!\n```\n\nSet `log=runtime=debug`, then start the node, You can see the logs:\n\n```bash\nDec 01 20:02:13.307 DEBUG execute_block:apply_extrinsic: print in contract:1    {ext}\n```\n\nThe logs printed  in the node by this method are all DEBUG level, and the `target` of the logs are all `runtime`. But compared with `println!`, the existing `log` crate in Rust provides the function of printing logs at different levels (like DEBUG|INFO...), and can use the `target` to filter the log, so the usage of `log` in debugging contracts is more powerful than `println!`.\n\nWe hope to provide the following functions in the contract by modifying `FRAME contract pallet` and `ink!` or providing other additional libraries:\n\n\n```rust\nimpl Erc20 {\n\t/// Creates a new ERC-20 contract with the specified initial supply.\n    #[ink(constructor)]\n    pub fn new(initial_supply: Balance) -> Self {\n        use log::{info, trace};\n        info!(target: \"contract1\", \"it's info log: {}\", initial_supply);\n        trace!(target: \"contract1\", \"it's trace log: {}\", initial_supply);\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAfter you executed the contract, you can see the logs in node:\n\n```bash\nDec 01 20:02:13.307 INFO contract1: it's info log:123    {ext}\nDec 01 20:02:13.307 TRACE contract2: it's trace log:123    {ext}\n```\n\n### 3. Fork `wasmi` interpreter to provide `Backtrace` functions etc.\n\nAs a WASM interpreter built by parity, `wasmi` has implemented all the standard functions of WASM. But for contract developers, the execution process of `wasmi` is similar to a black box. The contract developer only knows that the contract is executed by the `wasmi` interpreter after deployment, but cannot know the execution status of the contract in `wasmi`. If you encounter a crash such as `panic`, `wasmi` does not retain the current context and cannot report back the situation in the `function stack`. On the other hand, WASM does not currently provide a good breakpoint debugging and Single-step debugging method, so it is not possible to interrupt during WASM execution to view the information during execution.\n\nTherefore, we plan to fork `wasmi` and provide functions similar to `Backtrace` information. **We may also add Breakpoint Debugging in the future**\n\nIn the customized `HardHat EVM`, abnormal [`stack traces`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/#solidity-stack-traces) will be printed during the execution of the Solidity code:\n\n> ```text\n> Error: Transaction reverted: function selector was not recognized and there's no fallback function\n>   at ERC721Mock.<unrecognized-selector> (contracts/mocks/ERC721Mock.sol:9)\n>   at ERC721Mock._checkOnERC721Received (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:334)\n>   at ERC721Mock._safeTransferFrom (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:196)\n>   at ERC721Mock.safeTransferFrom (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:179)\n>   at ERC721Mock.safeTransferFrom (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:162)\n>   at TruffleContract.safeTransferFrom (node_modules/@nomiclabs/truffle-contract/lib/execute.js:157:24)\n>   at Context.<anonymous> (test/token/ERC721/ERC721.behavior.js:321:26)\n> ```\n\nIn `wasmtime`, when the inside execution of `panic` appears, similar output will be printed:\n\n```text\nError: failed to run main module `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/bt.wasm`\n\nCaused by:\n    0: failed to invoke command default\n    1: wasm trap: unreachable\n       wasm backtrace:\n         0: 0x1cda - <unknown>!__rust_start_panic\n         1: 0x1cce - <unknown>!rust_panic\n         2: 0x1c9e - <unknown>!std::panicking::rust_panic_with_hook::hc5713da015ebaa19\n         3:  0x26e - <unknown>!std::panicking::begin_panic::{{closure}}::h8e62ab0ea555186f\n         4:  0xfba - <unknown>!std::sys_common::backtrace::__rust_end_short_backtrace::h34a944558df1326a\n         5:  0x15c - <unknown>!std::panicking::begin_panic::h03c636dac2b8fb70\n         6: 0x1a65 - <unknown>!_start\n```\n\nIn `wasmer`, when the inside execution of `panic` appears, similar output will be printed:\n\n```text\nerror: failed to run `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/bt.wasm`\n│   1: RuntimeError: unreachable\n           at __rust_start_panic (bt.wasm[67]:0x1cda)\n           at rust_panic (bt.wasm[66]:0x1cce)\n           at std::panicking::rust_panic_with_hook::hc5713da015ebaa19 (bt.wasm[65]:0x1c9e)\n           at std::panicking::begin_panic::{{closure}}::h8e62ab0ea555186f (bt.wasm[2]:0x26e)\n           at std::sys_common::backtrace::__rust_end_short_backtrace::h34a944558df1326a (bt.wasm[36]:0xfba)\n           at std::panicking::begin_panic::h03c636dac2b8fb70 (bt.wasm[0]:0x15c)\n           at _start (bt.wasm[55]:0x1a65)\n╰─> 2: unreachable\n```\n\nIn `wasmi`, when the inside execution of `panic` appears , only the following output will be printed:\n\n```text\nthread 'main' panicked at ': Trap(Trap { kind: Unreachable })', src/bin/instantiate.rs:87:14\nnote: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace\n```\n\nLearning from the `HardHat EVM`, `wasmer` and `wasmtime`, we will make similar modifications to `wasmi` to achieve similar functions. We will migrate the relevant code of [`wasmer`](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer) and [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) to develop similar functions into `wasmi`.\n\nWe estimate that we should at least implement the following two parts in `wasmi` in order to provide a printing function similar to `BackTrace` information in `wasmi`:\n\n1. Keep the stack information of the WASM execution stack.\n2. Parse the `Name Section` in the `*.wasm` source file with compilation information to provide corresponding debugging information.\n\n## Detailed plan of v0.2 （6 weeks, 30 Nov ~ 11 Jan）：\n   \n* M1: Fork `FRAME Contracts pallet`. (3 developers \\* 2 weeks) *\n    1. Enrich the error types of the module, associate more error messages related to the internal `wasmi` interpreter, and attach some context information to the error and print it in the log.\n    2. Provide the function of tracking the contract call stack.\n    3. Add Event Tracking to the function defined in the `define_env!` macro to provide statistics on contract execution information.\n    4. Provide a function to print statistical data of a period of contract execution to the log.\n   \n* M2: Provide `log` tools and function/macro in contracts. (3 developers \\* 1 weeks) *\n    1. Provide components similar to `RuntimeLogger` in Substrate Runtime\n    2. Provide the corresponding method in `define_env!` of `FRAME Contracts Pallet`\n    3. Provide wrapper functions and other functions for `RuntimeLogger` in `ink!`\n\n* M3: Fork `wasmi`. (3 developers \\* 2 weeks) *\n    1. Investigate the design of `wasmer`, `wasmtime` and `wasmi`\n    2. Design and implement functions similar to `Backtrace` for `wasmi`\n   \n* M4 : Integration and testing  (3 developers \\* 1 weeks) *\n\nThe above-mentioned forked repos are independent of Europa repo, and the corresponding functions will not be submitted to the original repo. If there are similar functions in the original repo plan, the corresponding functions will be merged after discussion with the original repo author.\n\n## Cost of v0.2 (18 developers \\* weeks)\n\n* Operating activities: $3600 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per developer * week )\n* Employee payments: $36000 ($1900 per developer * week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $37800\n* Exchange Rate: $5.0 / DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 7560 DOT\n\n## Verification : Github source & Treasury Report\n\n1. Construct incorrect contracts and execute logs printing to determine whether it meets expectations\n   1. Can trigger all wrong contracts in `wasmi`\n   1. Can trigger all wrong contracts in `FRAME Contracts Pallet`\n   1. Construct a contract to call a contract example and crash in it\n1. Display the call statistics of the `define_env!` interface during contract execution\n1. Execute the log printing function, provide formatted printing examples of different data, and judge whether it meets expectations\n1. Construct a contract that crashes under different conditions and record the log after execution. Then judge whether the backtrace information of the contract execution is completely printed, and check whether it matches the actual execution of the collapsed contract.\n",

      "content": "**Problem: **There are not enough resources available to developers wanting a more hands-on approach to learning Substrate. In order to see a vibrant Polkadot ecosystem, we must first address education so that developers have the tools to build. \n\n**Goal: **Create a hands-on and affordable educational environment where developers can learn first hand from existing developers in the Polkadot ecosystem. We want to give developers the tools (education and mentorship) to build the next great DApp or Parachain on Polkadot. While Acala has created the educational framework, we need help ensuring that any qualified developer who cannot afford the Academy will have access to it through a scholarship. \n\n\n**How we’ll get there… **\n\nThe Substrate Blockchain Developer Academy brings together the best in industry expertise, interactive learning, and a recognized certification program to help developers learn to program and build on Substrate and Polkadot in just 6 weeks.

We would like for the Polkadot Treasury to provide scholarships to students so that they can learn the skills it takes to build the next great application or parachain on Polkadot. \n\n**Financial Commitment: **\n643 DOTs\n\n**Your commitment provides:**\nFull sponsorship of 6 students into the Substrate Developer Academy\n\n**Scholarship Evaluation Process:**\nThe Acala team will act as a stand in for evaluating scholarship applicants for this Substrate Developer Academy course and will work with other organizations in the ecosystem to identify developers who are in need of financial support. \n\n**Criteria for scholarship will be based on: **\nApplicant has mastered at least 1 programming language\nApplicant has a minimum of one year professional coding experience\nApplicant has demonstrated financial need. \n\n**Payment Conditions:**\nA one-time payment of 643 DOTs (monthly average of $4.36 per DOT) \nShould there be any funds that are unused, Acala will roll them over into the next Developer Academy for scholarship purposes. At the request of Council, Acala will return any remaining funds to the treasury. \n\n**Measuring Success: **\nAt the end of the program, Acala will report back on the amount of participating developers, graduation rate, projects started/completed, and other unforeseen success metrics (e.g., hires into the Polkadot ecosystem, etc). It is our goal to give developers the tools to build -- and then help them integrate into the ecosystem for collaboration and funding opportunities. \n\n**Future Plans:**\nAcala intends to continue refining and improving upon the Substrate Developer Academy. In 2021, we plan to roll out an updated version of the Substrate Developer Academy -- students will be able to apply for a scholarship directly via a Substrate Academy Bounty Program. ",

      "content": "After successful completion of the first milestone, we are pleased to submit our proposal for the second and final milestone of the LocalCoinSwap non-custodial trading implementation for Polkadot.\n\n**Github:** https://github.com/LocalCoinSwap/\n\n**Homepage:** https://localcoinswap.com/\n\n**Intro:**\n\nLocalCoinSwap is a P2P cryptocurrency exchange which focuses on providing trustless fiat on-ramp solutions, enabling global accessibility for cryptocurrencies. We bridge the gap between users and crypto where centralized exchanges fail, in particular across developing regions of the world where access to mainstream finance is limited.\n\nIn the first milestone of this project we extended the kusama-utils library that we previously built to create a generic substrate-utils library. We also extended the Kusama-api to create a generic Substrate-API. These packages are now generically useful for any number of substrate parachains and tokens.\n\nFor the second milestone, we will be utilizing these libraries to allow Polkadot to be fully tradable on the LocalCoinSwap API as well as through the LocalCoinSwap front-end application. This includes end-user wallet functionality, non-custodial P2P trading, basic and advanced pricing mechanisms as well as allowing crypto-to-crypto swaps.\n\nPlease check out our detailed proposal below and we welcome any questions or feedback: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vP54xXbJxPC1nJQ0RA7TC4S16mFAuNvSP6iDxfFFcPc/edit",

      "content": "As you might remember from past discussions, with the v26 runtime being in Polkadot, [a bug](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/7384) that caused immature slashing of candidacy bonds in council was fixed, and now's the time to proceed with refunding affected accounts.\n\nBased on our experience in Kusama Network, **Motion 43** aims to reimburse candidates and runners-up who were slashed due to this bug. In order to verify hash, please review this [gist](https://gist.github.com/kianenigma/93c3a86a72823a3f703c442e00929a0a) (generated using [this snippet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-debug-kit/blob/b6b818ae1bc6a834f2010e8a58726231034ed8c1/remote-ext-elections-phragmen/js/src/index.ts#L597-L624)). The motion wraps all of the reimbursement calls inside a `utility.batch`, creating a single batch of force transfers from the treasury to the affected accounts.\nAll councillors please vote at your convenience! If the motion passes, the proposal will be after voted by the community.\n\nOriginal post can be found [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/165).",

      "title": "Patract Hub's treasury proposal for Megaclite (ZKP support) v0.1",
      "content": "**The original post is https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/167, after the feedbacks from the group, we have decided to modify our proposal into this, and we have highlighted the difference (bond and deletion)**\n\n## Suggestions from W3F and Parity\n\n> [Arkworks](http://github.com/arkworks-rs/)' library is better than Zcash's old library\n> \n> Ethereum's alt_bn128 is too old, we originally decided only add bls12_381, W3F suggests to add another two curves: BLS12-377, BW6_761\n> \n> The native layer's design (Runtime interface or WASM boundary) for final complete crypto curves support is TBD, so we will not try to merge our code into Substrate about the crypto units in native layer. We will change this project as the POC and show the real benchmark difference of native and WASM implementation. So, we have decided to deliver two version of the crypto units (ADD, MUL, Pairing) of those four curves in native layer and in Runtime WASM layer.\n\nAmong the current Layer 2 solutions to the privacy and throughput problems of blockchains, zero-knowledge proof is considered the most powerful solution. Compared with Channels, Mixers, and Ring Signature, zero-knowledge proof is the most difficult to implement, but the effect is the best, and it can be applied to almost all scenarios on the blockchain. With the development of some technologies around the Ethereum community in recent years, the efficiency of zero-knowledge generation and verification has been greatly improved, and the upper layer abstract has become more and more mature, and the development difficulty has been greatly reduced. Recently, some related projects have appeared in the Polkadot community, such as [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/), [Starks Network](http://www.gbctech.cn/), etc., but for WASM smart contract and Runtime development, the Substrate framework still lacks some underlying technical support.\n\nPatract Hub https://patract.io develops local open source tool suite and a one-stop cloud smart IDE, and is committed to providing free development tools and infrastructure services for Polkadot's WASM smart contract ecosystem. Megaclite is the 5th project of Patract Hub. In the process of developing this project, we will also launch the 6th project at the same time: Metis, a WASM smart contract library. The Megaclite project will be dedicated to introducing basic zero-knowledge proof underlying support for the Polkadot ecology, so that developers can easily develop applications at the upper level through WASM smart contracts or Runtime. Megaclite will  support the more mature zkSNARK-related technologies firstly, and may also support zkSTARK-related underlying technologies later.\n\n## ZK Rollup Introduction\n\nCompared with the privacy function, the performance improvement brought by Rollup is the early application direction of zero-knowledge proof. At present, the Layer 2 expansion plan of the blockchain is to transfer a considerable part of the on-chain workload to off-chain to complete, and the most watched one is ZK Rollup. The essence of ZK Rollup is to compress the application on-chain state and store it in a Merkle tree, and move the state transition funtions to off-chain. At the same time, the correctness of the off-chain state transition process is guaranteed through the proof of zkSNARK. Compared with the high cost of directly processing state changes on the chain, the ZK Proof's on-chain smart contract verification is extremely cost low. At the same time, the compressed information will also be submitted to the chain together with the proof, which ensures data availability and obtains the same level of security as Layer 1.\n\nThe Ethereum Layer 2 protocols related to ZK Rollup are: [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), [aztec](https://aztec.network/), etc. Their contract verification modules share a part of the elliptic curve's basic algorithms. In 2017, Ethereum integrated three basic cryptographic calculation units of the alt_bn128 curve in the form of pre-compiled contracts, which are [EIP196](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-196.md)’s ADD and Scalar_MUL algorithms, and [EIP197](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-197.md)’s Pairing algorithm. On top of this, due to the lack of rapid upgrade capabilities of Ethereum, the community can only encapsulate some tool libraries through costly Solidity contracts. On top of these basic contract libraries, many DApps can combine ZK Rollup technology to achieve some innovations, such as [loopring](https://loopring.org/), [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) and [uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) etc. However, in the past 3 years, ZK technology has further developed, such as the more practical [BLS curve](https://electriccoin.co/blog/new-snark-curve/), and [PLONK algorithm](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953/20190827:165656) etc. Ethereum has not yet supported it.\n\n## Megaclite's Future Development Plan （v0.1 ~ v0.3）\n\nGithub：https://github.com/patractlabs/megaclite\n\nMegaclite will firstly provide the following functions on our Jupiter smart contract testnet. ~~After full verification, we will apply to Parity to merge this into the Substrate framework.~~\n\n- Provide more on-chain underlying cryptography support than Ethereum. The current stage includes two curves : [alt_bn128](https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/bn) and [bls12_381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381) , **and two more: BLS12-377, BW6_761**\n\n- Integrate ADD, MUL, Paring units in Native layer, and provide them to Runtime applications through Runtime-Interface, and further provide them to WASM contract applications through Contract-Seal\n\n- **Integrate ADD, MUL, Paring units in Runtime WASM layer, and provide them to WASM contract applications through Contract-Seal**\n\n- Through Pallet and Ink! contract libraries, providing more higher-level verification and crypto tools than Ethereum, improving execution efficiency and reducing development costs\n\n- Provide off-chain cryptography toolbox through Rust SDK\n\n- Provide typical sample applications through Ink! sample contracts\n\n### v0.1: Provide on-chain support for elliptic curve alt_bn128 and bls12_381 **and BLS12-377, BW6_761**(5 weeks)\n\n- Integrate addition (ADD), scalar multiplication (MUL) and Pairing functions of the curves in Native layer **and Runtime WASM layer**.\n\n- Provide these three functions to the upper Runtime Pallets and Contracts to call.\n\n- In the Runtime layer and the Ink! contract layer, provide two zkSNARK Verify upper-layer interfaces ( verification function of groth16, similar to the Verifier library of [ethsnarks](https://github.com/HarryR/ethsnarks)).\n\n- Start the Metis project and implement EdDSA, MerkleTree, MiMC Hash, etc. contract library on the Ink! contract layer.\n\n### v0.2: Provide off-chain toolbox support for Ink! contract (5 weeks)\n\n[ZoKrates](https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates) is the zkSNARKs toolbox on Ethereum. It helps developers generate computable proofs using high-level languages and verify the proofs in the Solidity environment. We will transform this toolbox based on ZoKrates to adapts to the Ink! smart contract environment.\n\n-  Support the complete commands supporting the zkSNARKs protocol, including the use of Compile, Setup, Compute-witness, Generate-proof, Export-verifier and other commands in the Ink! smart contract environment\n\n- Provide Javascript toolkit, support API interface, including compile, computeWitness, setup, generateProof, exportSolidityVerifier, etc.\n\n### v0.3: Create a sample payment DApp based on Megaclite (6 weeks)\n\nPayment is one of the typical scenarios for the large-scale popularization of blockchain applications. However, due to the performance, cost and scalability of the Layer 1 basic chain, low-latency and high-throughput payment applications cannot be implemented on the Layer 1 chain. Now benefiting from the basic capabilities of zkSNARKs provided by the previous two versions, we will implement a highly scalable payment application based on Layer 2 ZK Rollup technology for the community. \n\nThe application has the following characteristics: completely trust-free, anti-censorship, high security, fast real-time, high throughput. Developers can reuse the application code with very few changes and directly apply it to the Polkadot WASM smart contract ecosystem to serve large-scale community users, and it will also bring great scalability to the Polkadot parachain.\n\n- Provide a Metis smart contract library that supports deposit, withdrawal, transfer and verification of off-chain ZK proof\n- Provide ZKP engine including transaction pool, Merkel state tree, circuit, and proof generation\n- Provide state management module and transaction pool module\n\n## Detailed Design of v0.1: 5 weeks (16 Nov - 21 Dec)\n\n### M1: Integrate the basic units of alt_bn128 & bls12_381 & **and BLS12-377, BW6_761** (3 developer * 1 weeks)\n1. ~~Prepare the 3 basic algorithm codes (Add, Scalar_Mul, and Pairing) of alt_bn128 elliptic curve from zcash's official library [bn](https://github.com/zcash-hackworks/bn)~~ \n2. ~~Prepare the same 3  basic algorithm codes of bls12_381 from zcash's official library [bls12_381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381)~~\n3. **Prepare the basic algorithm codes (Add, Scalar_Mul, and Pairing) for 4 curves from arkworks' library** \n4. Integrate the above algorithms into the under layer of Substrate Runtime **and Runtime WASM layer**.\n\n### M2: Provide to upper runtime and smart contract applications (3 developers * 1 weeks)\n1. Add Runtime_interface to the Jupiter testnet and provide it to Runtime applications.\n2. Add Contract_Seal to the contract module of the Jupiter testnet and provide it to the WASM contract application.\n\n### M3: Integrate upper-level verification and tool functions (3 developers * 1 week)\n1. The runtime pallet that implements the zkSNARK verification algorithm.\n2. The Metis contract library that implements the zkSNARK verification algorithm.\n3. The Metis contract library that implements other commonly used algorithms, such as EdDSA, MerkleTree, MiMC Hash, etc. and other commonly used algorithms.\n\n### M4: Test (3 developers * 1 week)\n1. Test six basic elliptic curve algorithms\n2. Test the zkSNARK verification algorithm of the Runtime layer\n3. Test the zkSNARK verification algorithm implemented in the contract layer\n4. Test EdDSA, MerkleTree, MiMC, etc. and other commonly used algorithm contract templates.\n\n### M5: Benchmark (3 developers * 1 week)\n1. Provide benchmark results of all the above functions and develop them for the community as a reference for transaction weight and pricing.\n\n## Cost of v0.1 (15 developers * weeks)\n* Operating activities: $3000 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per employee \\* week )\n* Developer payments: $28500 ($1900 per developer \\* week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $31500\n* Exchange Rate: $5.8 / DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 5431 DOT\n\n## How to verify v0.1: Jupiter Testnet & Youtube demo & Github library\n\n1. The cryptographic units can be verified through the Runtime and Metis contract modules that we deploy on Jupiter.\n2. The upper-level Verification function can be verified through the Runtime and Metis contract modules deployed on Jupiter.\n3. The functions of the upper-level tools can be verified through the Metis contract module deployed on Jupiter.\n4. You can view and reproduce our Benchmark results.\n",

Combine the features of Substrate to add various plug-ins, such as Waffle, Jupiter, Gas report.\n- v0.4: Provide Typescript type support for contracts (similar to Typechain), integrate multi-language SDK, etc.\n\nWe have finished the second [proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/13) requirements for v0.2,  and wrote a development [report](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/156). This proposal will explain in detail the design details of Redspot v0.3. After ink! v3 was released last month, many developers began to pay attention to the development of the WASM contract. After the refactoring of v0.2, Redspot also has more powerful functions. We think now is the time to get help from Parity and W3F, and promote Redspot to the community. We hope to serve more developers and get their feedback to help us fix bugs and optimize Redspot.\n\nWe expect a major upgrade to the plugins system in the future. This upgrade is mainly to strengthen TypeScript support, simplify the introduction of plugins, and strengthen support for multiple contracts. We also plan to add more Redspot plugins:\n\n1. Jupiter testnet plugin. Jupiter is a testnet we provide specifically for contract development. It has made some modifications to the pallet contract. We expect that after different chains integrate the pallet contract, there will be some customized modifications to the contract. Therefore, in the face of different chains with contract functions, Redspot will design plug-ins for the contract environment of this chain. The Jupiter test chain plugin will show how Redspot is compatible with different parachain contract development through plugins.\n\n2. Gas report plugin v0.2. This plugin can print out gas consumption reports for all transactions of the contract.\n\n3. Waffle's assertion library (https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html). It provides a lot of friendly matchers to make contract testing easier to write and read. Especially in polkadot.js, because all data is an object, testing is more difficult. You cannot directly judge `expect(A).to.Be(B)`, you must judge `expect(A.toHex()).to.Be(B.toHex())` like this. A custom matcher can simplify this step.\n\n\n## Detailed design of v0.3 （5 weeks，03 Nov ~ 8 Dec）\n\n### M1: Homepage and API docs page development  ((1 designer + 3 developer) * 1 week)\n\n1. Develop https://redspot.patract.io, include logo design, UI design, UX design, and promotional materials.\n2. Establish Redspot's brand reputation and draft promotional copy.\n3. Technical selection of homepage and API documents, and development of front-end web pages.\n4. Write CI that automatically publishes API documents to ensure real-time updates of documents.\n5. Establish the i18n program, officially support Chinese and English, and accept translations from other languages in the community.\n\n### M2: Write detailed tutorials and documents (3 developers * 1 week)\n\n1. Add detailed comments to each externally provided function so that developers can get more detailed code hints when using TypeScript.\n2. Add a tutorial on how to use Redspot and a tutorial on how to write a plugin for Redspot.\n3. Add a page explaining the error code in detail. In the process of using Redspot, errors logs will link to this page.\n4. Add a Q&A page that lists the problems and solutions frequently encountered by developers.\n5. Write the plugins documentation.\n\n### M3: Upgrade Redspot's plugin system (3 developers * 1 week)\n\n1. Improve TypeScript support, so developers don't need to import the tsconfig.json file.\n2. Delete the usePlugin function, developers can automatically import the plug-in when imported/required.\n3. Better support for multi-contract projects, artifacts can generate nested directory structure.\n4. Improve the TypeScript type support of the plugin, so developers don't need to manually import type-extensions.d.ts.\n5. Develop CI, automated testing and release version.\n6. Specify version number and release process. Write a changelog to record the changes made during each upgrade.\n\n### M4: Develop Jupiter plugin and Gas Report v0.2 plugin (3 developers * 1 week)\n\n1. The Jupiter testnet is optimized for contract address generation. We will add the Jupiter plugin, which can add new contract APIs and change the way the internal address is generated. This plugin will be used as an example to show the compatibility and scalability of Redspot in supporting contracts on different chains.\n2. The previous version of Gas Report v0.1 will print Gas consumption when invoking transactions. In the new version of Gas Report, we will package it as a standalone plug-in. It can add a Task, which will print out the Gas consumption of all transactions in the current contract. It will also expand the test Task, and print out the Gas consumption of all transactions when the test is finished.\n\n### M5: Develop assertion library (3 developers * 1 week)\n\n1. Investigate existing matchers for contract testing on Ethereum and design matchers based on @redspot/patract.\n2. Implement the matcher.\n3. Implement a universal polkadot.js matcher.\n\n## Cost of v0.3 (1 designer \\* week + 15 developers \\* weeks)\n* Operating activities: $3200 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per employee \\* week )\n* Designer payments: $1000 ($1000 per designer \\* week)\n* Developer payments: $28500($1900 per developer \\* week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $32700\n* Exchange Rate: $4.1 / New DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 7975 New DOT\n\n## How to verify: Official Website & Youtube demo & Github library\n\n* View Redspot's homepage https://redspot.patract.io\n* Check out the documents and tutorials we wrote\n* Jupiter plugin\n    * Support unique settings on Jupiter\n    * Modify the address calculation method of Redspot's contract\n* Gas Report plugin v0.2:\n    * A command to print gas consumption\n    * At the end of the test, print gas consumption\n* Demonstrate the usage of assertion library\n    * Support `@redspot/patract` return value matching\n    * Support matching of values in polkadot.js",

      "content": "[Following our discussion on Polkassembly](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/150) - here is the proposal for on-ramp to polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Intro:**\nWe see the Polkadot ecosystem developing, but for usage numbers to come, easy access for new users must be ensured. Currently, the first-time user willing to enter the ecosystem must enter either via centralised exchange. These steps are bearable for the current users of the network and crypto-natives, but will be a huge obstacle to new participants.\nTo significantly improve the process for the end-user, networks need on-ramps for easy, streamlined access using fiat money.\n\n**Solution**\nHere enters Ramp. With Ramp the purchase process takes place in just one interface, it is directly correlated to the wallet user is using for the purchase and, usually, takes much less time and requires fewer data than centralised exchanges need.\nRamp offers a powerful SDK that allows developers to offer DOT purchases with cards, bank transfers and open banking within their apps. This means that Polkadot powered solutions requiring DOT to use wouldn't need to ask new users to leave the app to complete the purchase. Think of it as Stripe for crypto onboarding. \nWith Ramp, we want to provide DOT users and developers with a battle-tested alternative to a centralised exchange: an on-ramp that easy to implement and delightful to use. It will shorten the onboarding process from a few days to a few minutes which will contribute to the overall development of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nDetails of the proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u0h1CRrK-a-a83mecWSzNfvlBxUCurFf6Z6cME_HHCA/edit?usp=sharing",

      "content": "Following on from our initial [Polkassembly discussion post](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/144#9a968c2d-15a1-4252-9015-303d83145838) we are pleased to submit our proposal for the first milestone of the LocalCoinSwap non-custodial trading implementation.\n\n**Github:** https://github.com/LocalCoinSwap/\n\n**Homepage:** https://localcoinswap.com/\n\n**Intro:**\n\nLocalCoinSwap is a P2P cryptocurrency exchange which focuses on providing trustless fiat on-ramp solutions, enabling global accessibility for cryptocurrencies. We bridge the gap between users and crypto where centralized exchanges fail, in particular across developing regions of the world where access to mainstream finance is limited.\n\nAfter a successful proof of concept with Kusama, we are now looking to extend the underlying infrastructure that we have developed to make a single package that is generically useful for any arbitrary number of parachains and tokens. We will then use this package to develop an open-source non-custodial trading integration for Polkadot. This will allow a trustless non-custodial fiat on/off ramp for DOT.\n\nFollowing on from the discussion in the original thread, we have updated the proposal to better reflect the full scope of the project. Please check out our detailed proposal below and we welcome any questions or feedback: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1vP54xXbJxPC1nJQ0RA7TC4S16mFAuNvSP6iDxfFFcPc/edit#",

      "content": "Previous discussion can be found at [post 138](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/138).\n\n\n# Problems\nWe got news about Kusama and Polkadot from twitter, social media, and blogs. But to get them, first we need to open the corresponding links in the browser and sometimes we may need to login. For knowledge, usually we search some topic with google, or go to [substrate.dev](https://substrate.dev/) to search the tip we are interested in.\n\nProblems with current situation:  \n- News are not fast enough and not effective to readers. Even in telegram when we share the link, though we can see a short description, it's not cool and not effective to audiences.\n- Twitter message authoring and post writing is time consuming, while it's nearly impossible for a developer or marketing staff to create some cool images to polish the content.\n- It's hard for developers to share some knowledge in a flash and effective way.\n- Image is the most popular way to broadcast info in China. We broadcast them in wechat chat groups and friends circle, but currently there are no convenient ways to generate flash news or knowledge tips for Polkadot ecosystem projects.\n\n# Authoring tool\n\nWe propose a **knowledge tip** and **flash news** authoring tool to solve the above problems. With this tool we can:\n- Write only title and detail to generate a cool image which is very easy to broadcast and friendly to content audience.\n- Some image banners are prepared, and authors just need to choose one from them.\n\nFollowing scenarios will be supported to help Kusama, Polkadot and other ecosystem projects to broadcast news and knowledge tip.\n\n1. Project may have a flash good news which they want to spread it fast. Then a developer generate a image contains the news, and broadcast it to the telegram channels. Telegram readers just click the image, and the full content is shown to them, and they don't have to open the browser.\n\n2. A normal user open this cool, create a image which explain 'what is kusama council', then broadcast it to social media. The content readers can reach this explanation in a fast way and ecosystem users can get this knowledge in a very clear way.\n\n# Design drafts of this tool\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/KxlccWi.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/CPk8y4J.png)\n\nAnd the generated image may look like follows:\n\n![generated-image](https://i.imgur.com/LUurImp.png)\n\n# Milestones\n\n## M1(One week)\n- Design, including the page layout and several banners for the templates. One designer and one developer will be involved.\n- Front page components development and 2 developers will be involved.\n\nCost: 4000$ = 833Dots, while each Dot cost 4.8$.\n\n# Future work\n\n- More themes for Polkadot and Kusama\n- More default banners for Polkadot and Kusama\n- Support customized banner\n\n---\n\nWe are [OpenSquare](https://www.opensquare.network/), and we are dedicated to facilitate the collaborations between Polkadot ecosystem projects and developers, designers, etc.",

      "title": "Patract Labs' treasury proposal for Elara v0.1",
      "content": "FYI: This is copy from: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/103, and Elara is the fourth project that we planned in our roadmap https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/100.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/patractlabs/elara](https://github.com/patractlabs/elara) and Homepage will be: [https://elara.patract.io](https://elara.patract.io)\n\nIn Polkadot, Kusama and other parachains, RPC is the interface between DApp and the network. As the Polkadot network continues to expand, more and more parachains will be online, and more and more parachains will support smart contract functions. Faced with more and more parallel chains, developers need to build and maintain multiple blockchain nodes in order to interact with them, which will be a huge development cost for them. Whether it is facing the development and testing needs of developers or users' online DApp usage requirements, a convenient, fast and stable network access is one of the necessary conditions, and it is also the infrastructure of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nElara is inspired by [Infura](https://infura.io/) from the Ethereum ecosystem, named after Jupiter’s seventh moon. Elara's goal is to build a similar infrastructure and network public access services to provide developers with a unified access layer based on Substrate multi-chain. In addition, Elara will be used as part of the smart contract development service, and will be integrated with other components of the Patract toolchain in the future, in terms of contract development environment support, development tools component, contract deployment and DApp release. Elara will be Polkadot’s infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building upper-level applications.\n\n### Summary of Elara's future plan:\n\n1. ** v0.1: Implement Substrate node access**\n\t* Create a server-side framework to develop proxy access, automatic monitoring and data statistics to the RPC service of the Substrate node\n\t* Support developers to use http and websocket protocols to uniformly access the network through the server framework\n\t* Develop a front-end dashboard to display relevant monitoring statistics of the RPC service of the Substrate node\n\n2. **v0.2: Implement function expansion and performance optimisation**\n\t* Create account space for developers, support developers to use Github as a third-party login method\n\t* Support multiple projects under the account space\n\t* Provide developers with detailed access information of the DApp project by multiple dimensions, including statistical indicators such as daily and weekly requests, calling methods, and source of user group requests\n\t* Optimise program performance\n\n3. **v0.3: Implement multi-link entry**\n\t* Extended program structure, support multi-chain architecture\n\t* Access to Polkadot, Kusama, and other blockchains, such as Jupiter\n\t* Provide developers with public access services of Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains, such as Jupiter\n\t* Provide multi-chain interface documentation\n\n4. **v0.4: Implement Polkadot ecological access & service operation and maintenance**\n\t* Establish a parallel link in Github to enter the process automation specification\n\t* Access to more parallel chains in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\t* Deploy and maintain hundreds of nodes globally\n\t* Support 10,000 developers, each developer account can establish 20 DApp projects, and each DApp project can use 1M daily access service\n\n### Detailed design of v0.1 (5 weeks, 21 Sept ~ 26 Oct)\n\n**Milestone 1: Design ( (1 designer + 4 developers) * 1 week)**\n\n* Design Dashboard UX, displaying relevant monitoring statistics\n* Design the data structure to store information such as the number of requests, calling methods, response bandwidth, response codes, etc.\n* Design the program framework and complete the technical selection\n\n**Milestone 2: Development (4 developers * 2 weeks)**\n\n* Deploy a local Substrate node\n* Develop a server-side program framework to implement basic functions such as request monitoring, distribution and logging\n* Develop proxy access module to implement proxy access for http and websocket requests\n* Develop monitoring statistics module to implement the statistics and analysis of requested data\n* Develop a front-end dashboard page to display relevant monitoring statistics of the RPC service of the Substrate node\n\n**Milestone 3: Integration (4 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\n* Integrate agent access module, monitoring statistics module to service program framework\n* Integrate front-end dashboard and back-end statistical data services\n* Develop a client request program to simulate access requests\n\n**Milestone 4: Testing (4 developers * 1  weeks)**\n\n* Deploy and test the back-end service program\n* Test client request access functions\n* Test server monitoring statistics functions\n* Test dashboard page functions\n\n### Cost of v0.1 (1 designer \\* week + 20 developers \\* weeks)\n\n* Operating activities: $3400 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per employee * week )\n* Designer payments: $1000 ($1000 per designer * week)\n* Developer payments: $30000 ($1500 per developer * week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $34400\n* Exchange Rate: $4 / New DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 8600 New DOT\n\n### How to verify v0.1: Youtube demo video & Github source\n\n* The Substreate node of the service can be accessed through http and websocket protocols\n* Can monitor RPC requests of Substrate nodes\n* Can view the relevant monitoring statistics from the dashboard",

      "title": "Patract Labs' treasury proposal for Europa v0.1",
      "content": "FYI: This is copy from: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/102, and Europa is the third project that we planned in our roadmap https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/100.\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/patractlabs/europa](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa)\n\nEuropa is inspired by [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), [Ethereumjs-VM](https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-vm) and [Buidler EVM](https://buidler.dev/buidler-evm/) from the Ethereum ecosystem. Europa is a sandbox of Substrate runtime environment, which would be used to simplify the developing, debugging, and integration test when developers develop Substrate runtime applications and test pallet-contracts. The sandbox will remove P2P and consensus functions, just remaining the execution environment and RPC interface. We will wrap the core modules, then provide a local database, a detailed log print function, a concept of workspaces which isolates different developing environments, and interact with different front-end UIs. The sandbox has no time interval between producing blocks, so debugging can be optimised to be very quickly.\n\n\n### Summary of Europa's future plan:\n\n**1. v0.1: Have an independent runtime environment to facilitate more subsequent expansion directions.**\n\nThe independent runtime environment of excluded nodes can be expanded more without the constraints of the node environment and WASM compilation, and can be easily integrated with other components. In this version, it is more like simulating the Ganache project in Ethereum ecosystem, enabling contract developers to develop without having to build a contract blockchain. Developers can quickly fire up a personal Substrate chain, which can be used to run tests, execute commands, and inspect state while controlling how the chain operates.\n\n**2. v0.2: Modify at contract module level to provide more information**\n\nIn this version, we will fork the pallet-contracts module for secondary development. We will strengthen the part of the error notification for contract developers, such as providing:\n\n* WASM stack traces, the function call stack during WASM contract execution;\n* Contracts stack traces, the call stack of a contract calling another contract;\n* Console.log, provides libraries and methods to print command lines during contract development;\n* Strengthen the error type and error display of the contract module;\n* Simple integration with Redspot;\n\n** 3. v0.3: Improve the developement experience, strengthen collaboration with other tools, and extend the sandbox to be compatible with other runtime modules**\n\n* Strengthen the integration with Redspot\n* Strengthen the integration with polkadot.js.org/apps to achieve complete RPC support\n* Support status data query\n\n\n### Detailed design of v0.1 (6 weeks, 21 Sept ~ 2 Nov):\n\n**Milestone 1 : (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\n* Implement an independent runtime executive environment\n* Implement `Externalities` trait for a `Externalities` -like object\n* Implement needed `Extension` trait interface.\n\n**Milestone 2 : (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\n* Implement a local database for this runtime executive environment to store all trie data, block and extrinsic\n* Implement a local database  to store a bypath k/v state data, for exporting and querying from those data.\n\n**Milestone 3 :  (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\n* Implement a block packing function to pack blocks directly rather than through consensus process, allowing to pack one or multiple extrinsics at once. \n* Providing a workspace concept to isolate different environment.\n\n**Milestone 4 :  (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\n* Implement RPC functions of \"forward to height\" and \"backward to height\"\n* Providing a way to pack blocks directly to assigned height\n* Revert current state to a reverted height\n\n**Milestone 5 : (3 developers * 2 weeks)**\n\n* Integration and testing\n\n\n### Cost of v0.1 (18 developers * weeks)\n\n* Operating activities: $3600 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per developer * week )\n* Employee payments: $36000 ($1900 per developer * week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $37800\n* Exchange Rate: $4/ New DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 9450 New DOT\n\n\n### How to verify v0.1: Youtube demo video & Github source\n\n* Build and run in an independent executable file\n* Can start from different workspaces, and a new workspace is an empty chain\n* Can receive extrinsics to set_code, deploy and call contracts directly\n* Can interact with Redspot\n* Can use RPC to jump over some blocks and revert to a specified height to revert states",

      "title": "Patract Labs' treasury proposal for Redspot v0.2",
      "content": "Copy from: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/101\n\nGithub: [https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot-0.2](https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot-0.2)\n\nRedspot's goal is to standardise the contract development process, hide the underlying compilation details of the contract, and combine the sandbox, library, API, SDK and other plugins to create a one-stop smooth contract development process. We have finished the first [proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/7) requirements for v0.1,  and written a development [report](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/78).\n\n### Summary of Redspot's future plan:\n\n1. v0.1: Build core available functions based on Truffle framework.\n2. v0.2: Migrate to the [Buidler](https://buidler.dev/) framework to enhance plugin extensibility and add some functions to provide a smoother development workflow.\n3. v0.3: Imitating Buidler's plugins, combined with the characteristics of Substrate to add various plugins, such as waffle, and began to integrate multi-language SDK.\n4. v0.4: Following the case of Buidler, add appropriate libraries, such as typechain, etc.\n\n### Problems of Redspot v0.1:\n\nAlthough we have completed all the basic functions of Redspot, there are still some inconveniences in use. E.g:\n\n* There is no convenient interactive cli for simple interaction with deployed contracts;\n* Only the private key in plain text is supported in the configuration file, derivation through seed is not supported, and the password cannot be hidden;\n* Under the default instantiation address logic of pallet-contracts, the contract address generated by a single account with the same parameters and the same WASM code is unique. This is not like Ethereum's single account can repeatedly deploy the same contract with different addresses. Therefore, after the deployment script and test script are written in Redspot, they can only be executed once. Otherwise, during the second execution, the execution will be interrupted during the deployment phase because it cannot be deployed. This requires script developers to pay careful attention to the writing method, otherwise it is easy to make mistakes. Redspot hopes to simplify this process.\n* When deploying scripts and test scripts are instantiating or calling contracts, gas_limit needs to be written in after estimated whether the current assets are sufficient to support contract execution. Redspot currently simply fills in a default value, and does not have an estimation method, and does not know the gas consumption after execution;\n\n### Detailed design of v0.2 (6 weeks, 21 Sept ~ 2 Nov):\n\nThe Buidler framework provides a \"plugin\" model, which can give Redspot great scalability and flexibility. This framework can also support Redspot to connect with contract modules on different parachains. For example, you can replace the environment of the target chain through plugins, add SDKs in other languages, and add extensible functions. In v0.2, Redspot will migrate all the functions of v0.1 to the new Buidler framework, and write various plugins to solve the problems of v0.1.\n\n**Milestone 1: (3 developers * 1 weeks )**\n\nFork Buidler framework and modify it to suit the Substrate blockchain, then migrate all the current features in  Redspot v0.1 as inner plugins to this new framework.\n\n**Milestone 2: (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\nSupport an interactive cli to operate deployed contracts, this cli will include injected polkadot.js interface and other helper functions, global env, key pairs, and connected node.\n\n**Milestone 3: (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\nPlugin 1: key pair support.\n* Developers can use a private key directly;\n* Developers can use a seed, and can derive account from this seed;\n* Developers can use indicate a path for the keystore file, so that the private key will not appear in the config file.\n\n**Milestone 4: (3 developers * 1 weeks)**\n\nPlugin 2: multiple executing test support. This plugin provides a way to allow developer to deploy contracts more than once using same account and parameters in tests.\n* Developers can use “beforeTest” to derive accounts and transfer some balance to this new account.\n* Developers can use this new account to deploy contracts.\n* Every executing test command will derive new accounts automatically.\n\n**Milestone 5: (3 developers * 0.5 week)**\n\nPlugin 3: [Jupiter](https://github.com/patractlabs/jupiter) test-net support as deploying environment;\n* Jupiter test-net will use a flag storage to allow developers to use same account, same parameters and same code to deploy more than once.\n* This plugin will develop a matching interface to interactive with Jupiter to set flag.\n* This plugin’s env will allow developers to do deploying and testing in a normal way.\n\n**Milestone 6: (3 developers * 1.5 weeks)**\n\nPlugin 4: gas usage report.\n* This plugin can print gas usage per test phase and deploying actions.\n* This plugin can print gas usage per interactive cli.\n\n### Cost of v0.2 (18 developers * weeks)\n* Operating activities: $3600 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per developer * week )\n* Employee payments: $27000 ($1500 per developer * week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $30600\n* Exchange Rate: $4/ New DOT\n* Treasury Proposal: 7650 New DOT\n\n### How to verify v0.2: Youtube demo video & Github source\n\n* Replay all v0.1 tests in v0.2\n* Show how Redspot v0.2 interactive cli works\n\n**Workflows:**\n\n* Use \"deploy\" command and execute deploying scripts\n* Use interactive cli\n* Call deployed contract\n* Send extrinsics to call a contract\n* Deploy a new contract in cli\n\n**Plugins:**\n\n* key pair plugin:\n    * allowing developers to use seed, private key or a keystore path in config\n* multiple executing test plugin:\n    * could repeat any test command without any changes in test scripts.\n* Jupiter test-net plugin:\n    * could connect with Jupiter test-net by using a config flag in config files\n    * could repeat any test command without any changes in test scripts.\n* Gas usage report plugin:\n    * could print gas usage for every test phase\n    * could print gas usage after calling a contract in interactive cli",

      "title": "Concerning slashes in eras 69 and 70 - Web3Italy validator",
      "content": "During the evening of 10 August 2020 and the morning of 11 August 2020, Web3Italy validators suffered network flaps that caused their nodes to go on downtime along with other nodes offline. \n\nAs a consequence of the downtime, Web3Italy validators got slashed on 11 August 2020, during era 69/70. A full report by Web3Italy can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HzHJaSenHvghEAvP4isIXzbIK1LeefQ6/view?usp=sharing). \n\nMotion 16 proposes the cancellation of the slash events during era 69 and 70 for Web3Italy. Below a summary of the most important points raised on Polkadot Direction channel: \n\n- The cancellation is designed to only cover Web3Italy validators.\n- The incident seems most likely related to an issue with software/hardware that had effects on both polkadot and Kusama, but affecting one network worse than the other.\n- Web3Italy would not have been slashed if the Web3 Foundation incident had not happened at the same time.\n- Web3Italy went offline for a minimum of 14 hours.\n\nThe motion is up for vote: all council members please review the information and cast your vote - for questions or comments, you can use the [Polkadot Direction channel](https://matrix.to/#/!OwgojQyBzTlUQGGLhq:matrix.parity.io?via=matrix.parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=web3.foundation) or this post.\n",

      "content": "** Labs Introduction & Overall Proposals: ** https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/15\n\n## Redspot v0.1\n\nGithub: https://github.com/patractlabs/redspot\n\nPatract Labs' first project is \"Redspot\", named after Jupiter's Great Red Spot, which is also the largest DOT in the solar system. Redspot is inspired by Truffle (https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) in Truffle Suite. Redspot is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for pallet-contracts. Redspot is trying to let the development of ink! be projectized and simplify the testing and interacting with contracts.\n\n### Milestones : 3 weeks (20 Aug - 11 Sept)\n\n**  M1: Testnet (1 developer * 2 weeks) **\n\n1. Quickly deploy a local Substrate node with smart contract pallet that can be debugged locally\n1. Launch a public testnet (named with Jupiter) with smart contract pallet, , and continuously maintain and upgrade it.\n\n** M2: Environment (2 developers * 2 weeks)**\n\n1. Provide command-line tools to pull resources from the network and build a local contract development and test environment by one command. \n1. Provide several built-in different contract template frameworks, such as single contract and multi-contract projects.\n\n** M3: Compile and Deploy (3 developers * 3 weeks)**\n\n1. Check whether the local Rust environment and contract development toolchain are complete\n1. Automatically discover the contract code existing in the specified directory of the project, especially for multi-contract projects, support independent compilation between contracts, generate metadata, etc.\n1. Support deploying contracts to the corresponding network through configuration files and command line options.\n\n** M4: Testing (3 developers * 3 weeks)**\n\n1. Provide a basic contract testing framework based on Mocha Assert or Jest\n1. Support connecting different networks for contract testing through configuration files\n1. Provide global parameters for common usage such as default accounts and network configuration, and provide some commonly used tools and assertion functions for testing\n1. Get the deployed contract instance through Javascript and support simple interaction with the contract interface\n\n### Cost\n\n- Operating activities: $5000 ( Rent: $1000 per week, Servers & Devices: $2000)\n- Employee payments: $24000  ( $1000 per developer * week)\n- -------------------- +\n- Total Cost: $29000\n- Exchange Rate: $2.90/DOT\n- Treasury Proposal: 10000 DOT\n\n### How to Verify: Youtube demo video & Github source\n\n1. Can simply deploy a local testnet to test.\n1. Can connect with the public testnet (Jupiter) to verify.\n1. Can generate a smart contract project's directory.\n1. Can use Redspot commands to do “compile”, “deploy”, “test”",
