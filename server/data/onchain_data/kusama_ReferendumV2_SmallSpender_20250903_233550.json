The core idea is a **Kusama Pass** that proves a user has ≥10 KSM locked for one year and grants **guaranteed eligibility for curated raffles,** for example, seats in **PBA-X** cohorts  and ticket giveaways for blockchain events. We can **pilot inside the Kusama/Polkadot community first** to validate utility and operations; if it gains traction, we can **expand to mainstream cultural venues** (events, concerts, exhibitions) to attract new audiences into the ecosystem.\n\nLanding:\n\n![Landing.png](https://i.ibb.co/vvv8rmBH/Landing.png)\n\n![Captura de pantalla 2025-08-11 004122.png](https://i.ibb.co/1tcqx6y1/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-08-11-004122.png)\n\nApp:\n\n\n![Captura de pantalla 2025-08-11 104315.png](https://i.ibb.co/60GYhv2v/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-08-11-104315.png)\n\n![Captura de pantalla 2025-08-11 003548.png](https://i.ibb.co/s9nQX0rR/Captura-de-pantalla-2025-08-11-003548.png)\n\nAsking for 210 KSM to keep working and cover some expenses.

Should our demo be successful, this scheduled spend will first be delayed and then canceled (sorry Bill) with our [tool](https://www.treasury-guardian.app/).\n\nOur project is about allowing milestone-based payouts at scale and with this Referendum we hope to showcase how that could work. With this tool we aim to improve treasury efficiency and get more eyes and involvement into Kusama and Polkadot OpenGov.\n\nGive us a [follow on X](https://x.com/TreasuryEff) for latest updates on the project.",

      "content": "Full proposal: [https://index.acuity.network/proposals/2/](https://index.acuity.network/proposals/2/)\n\nCurrently Acuity Index works by decoding each event into a Rust type that has been generated automatically by the [`subxt`](https://docs.rs/subxt/0.43.0/subxt/attr.subxt.html) macro by calling [EventDetails::as_root_event()](https://docs.rs/subxt/0.43.0/subxt/events/struct.EventDetails.html#method.as_root_event)\n\nThis has a number of problems. Currently event types are only derived for the latest runtime for each chain. If events have been modified or removed during chain upgrades the latest version of the indexer may not be able to index certain events from older blocks.\n\nOne solution to this would be to derive event types and maintain indexing macros for all runtimes that a chain has had. The burden of maintaining the indexer for each chain would be large and complex.\n\nDuring build the `subxt` macro is extremely slow and requires a considerable amount of RAM. Running it for every individual runtime would increase the build requirements considerably making maintenance even harder.\n\nConverting the event into dedicated types also increases the CPU time required during indexing.\n\nConsumers of the index (dapps) typically will not want to decode events into runtime-specific types. This would add to the complexity and maintenance burden of the dapp.\n\nIt is unusual for the schema of an individual event to change over a runtime upgrade. Typically events are added or removed.\n\nA much better approach is to call [EventDetails::field_values()](https://docs.rs/subxt/0.43.0/subxt/events/struct.EventDetails.html#method.field_values)\n\nThis has a number of advantages:\n\n* separate indexers do not need to be built for each chain\n* macros do not need to be written for custom pallets\n* chain indexing can be specified in a simple TOML file\n* a single specification can handle indexing all of a chain's runtime versions\n* decoded parameters for each individual event can be stored and returned in query results\n\nA chain index specification will include the following config items:\n\n* name\n* genesis hash\n* list of block numbers where index updates have occured - re-indexing will occur as necessary upon upgrade of Acuity Index or index specification\n* default full node url\n* Polkadot SDK version - Acuity Index must be updated to support it\n* for each current or historic pallet either specify:\n  * `default` for Polkadot SDK built-in pallets\n  * `custom` for each event variant specify which parameters should be indexed by which key\n\nFull proposal: [https://index.acuity.network/proposals/2/](https://index.acuity.network/proposals/2/)",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nI would like your support to fund an account used for common good activities with 333 KSM, near the upper limit of this track. Based on current projections this should fund said activities for beyond 12 months. I hope that the community trust that I would use the funds responsibly should they become in-excess. \n\nThe account is used in-part for activities such as:\n\n- Paying out staking rewards for several validators and their nominators\n- Refunding submission and decision deposits for several referenda on Kusama and the Collective chain\n- The account was previously funded by [the Treasury 5-6 months ago](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/470). There are now many more payouts per era as more validators are active and there is a higher drain on funds.\n\nIt is worthwhile noting that the account has [no outbound transfers](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Gch4VxQ79WhjgQqHomvJbqF3Woza5g5cYgM8SVQdDb9szz1?tab=transfer) and most (if not all) expenses on the account are transactional in nature; this means that 80% of the fees are returned to the treasury.\n\nThe account balance graph is shown below.\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV2o3v2mhfx3AeyX8HLrcrfLMZEFHwDnyxnBkSFqcSEQP)\n\nRegards,\nWill | Paradox | ParaNodes.io",

      "title": "Test Transfer of 1 DOT from Kusama Treasury Back to Bill’s Account",
      "content": "**Proposal: Test Transfer of 1 DOT from Kusama Treasury Back to Bill’s Account**\n\n**Track:** Track 32 - Small Spender \n\n**Request:** 1 DOT (≈ 0.25 KSM at 1 KSM = 4 DOT)\n\n<ins>**Objective:** </ins>This proposal aims to perform a live test of Kusama’s multi-asset treasury capabilities by executing a transfer of 1 DOT (a Polkadot asset) from the Kusama treasury to a known account. We will be using the verified BILL’s account, as he has already donated 2 DOT to the treasury [(https://assethub-kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/8552922-2)](url). so this request takes back only half of that contribution, leaving the treasury net +1 DOT. \n\nBy using this modest amount, we ensure minimal risk while proving the end-to-end flow: governance approval, cross-chain asset handling, and receipt by the beneficiary once the DOT/KSM rate and bridge are in place.\n\n<ins>**Track and Configuration:**</ins> We are using the Small Spender treasury track for this test. The Small Spender track on Kusama is designed for low-value spends and has a hard cap of 10 KSM-equivalent per proposal.\n\nWith the rate set in Referendum 521 ( 1 KSM = 4 DOT → 1 DOT = 0.25 KSM ), the requested 1 DOT corresponds to 0.25 KSM, which is just 2.5 % of the 10 KSM.\n\n<ins>**Transfer Details:** </ins>The on-chain call will utilize the new Treasury.spend extrinsic (multi-asset spend version).\n\nUnder the hood, this call instructs the Kusama treasury’s sovereign account on Asset Hub to send 1 DOT to the beneficiary. The assetKind parameters will designate Asset Hub (parachain ID 1000) as the location and DOT’s asset ID on that chain, and the beneficiary will be given as an XCM multi-location corresponding to <ins>JFArxqV6rqPSwBok3zQDnj5jL6vwsZQDwYXXqb1cFygnYVt</ins> on Asset Hub. Because the asset rate for DOT is already set, the governance system will automatically validate that 1 DOT ≈ 0.25 KSM is within the Small Spender track’s limit before the referendum can be approved.\n\n<ins>**Rationale:**</ins>  This test has several important motivations:\n\n- Proof of Functionality &  \n- Safety First & \n- Parameter Verification & \n- Demonstrating OpenGov Agility\n\n**<ins>Call Preimage (for reference)</ins>**: The precise call data will be constructed as a treasury.spend call. In human-readable terms, it will look like:\n\nTreasury.spend( { location: { parents:0, interior:{ X1:{ Parachain:1000 } } }, assetId: { Concrete:{ parents:2, interior:{ X1:{ GlobalConsensus:\"Polkadot\" } } } } }, 10_000_000_000, { parents:0, interior:{ X1:{ AccountId32:\"<Bill-addr>\" } } }, null )\nThis call will be encoded and submitted as the preimage for the referendum.  \n\n<ins>**Conclusion**</ins>\nBy approving this proposal, the Kusama community will conduct a safe, low-value experiment to affirm our newfound ability to handle cross-chain treasury spends. We will transfer 1 DOT from the Kusama Treasury to Bill’s account <ins>JFArxqV6rqPSwBok3zQDnj5jL6vwsZQDwYXXqb1cFygnYVt</ins>, verify its receipt on Asset Hub, and thereby demonstrate that the Kusama treasury can seamlessly spend non-KSM assets, specifically DOT.  \n\nAfter enactment anyone may call treasury.payout(<spendID>) – we will do so immediately and post the Tx hash in the comments.\n",

      "content": "KSM trading recently went live on Hydration after referendum #490 ([https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/490)](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/490\\)) approved 33,333 KSM in Treasury LP. This has finally opened up liquidity flows between the two chains.\n\nWhen transfers are made between the two using the Kusama <> Polkadot bridge, if a user does not have sufficient KSM/ DOT (depending on the chain) on the receiving network then a portion of the asset they’re sending (e.g. KSM from KAH to PAH) is swapped for the native token to pay for fees. This is excellent UX and prevents user frustration with having to collect fees before bridging assets - however, unfortunately the current liquidity leaves much to be desired and as a result users can get rekt by slippage and lose much larger amounts of their assets to fees than expected.\n\nThis proposal, if approved, will supply 333 KSM to a 2/2 multisig with signers Leemo & lolmcshizz - which combined with referendum ([https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1479](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1479)) on Polkadot, will be split between Kusama AssetHub and Polkadot AssetHub 50/50 to provide a base level of liquidity on each network. This will ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for these small swaps and users will only pay the fees they are expecting to when making transfers.\n\nAny excess tokens will be returned to their respective treasuries.",

      "content": "I would like to thank you for reviewing and providing feedback on my Proposal #479, at [https://x.com/TheKusamarian/status/1869321713118593388](https://x.com/TheKusamarian/status/1869321713118593388)\n\nAccordingly, I am hereby resubmitting my proposal by:\n\n1- Revising the market cap milestones outlined in the V-Paper, and\n\n2- Providing further clarifications and highlights on the merits of the project.\n\nHere is the link to the Draft V-Paper, which remains unchanged from the previous submission, except for the revised market cap targets for the milestones:\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aAcDTVe9H4WfAe2e2MkhHQ8FBaJGqS45/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aAcDTVe9H4WfAe2e2MkhHQ8FBaJGqS45/view?usp=sharing)\n\nAs a reminder, the basics of the VCAP token are as follows:\n\n**The Proposed Token Concept's** \n\n**Name:** Crypto VC Fund\n\n**Ticker:** VCAP\n\n**Chain:** Kusama Asset Hub\n\n**Liquidity Pair:** VCAP/ KSM\n\nI assure you that the points I must make cannot be adequately summarized in a TL;DR format, so please read this all the way through. I promise it will be a clarifying, easy, and fun read.\n\n**QUESTION 1: THE MARKET CAP MILESTONES ARE VERY HIGH, ESPECIALLY IN PROPORTION TO THE CURRENT MARKET CAP OF KUSAMA; HOW COME IS THIS REALISTIC?**\n\nThis is what I’m talking about. The point in the Kusama community supporting this project would be to catapult KSM to much higher market caps, similar to what BONK token provided to Solana at the time. SHIB and Ethereum can be seen as the most impressive historical example. TON and TRON ecosystems have also raised certain star tokens that helped greatly with their price-wise take-offs.\n\nBut dramatically unlike those examples, our story shall not base upon the overused and ramped down meme concept, but a real breakthrough, a paradigm shift.\n\nYou are encouraged to read Clause 2 of the Draft V-Paper; it is the summary of the scholarly article I have written, yet not published, abridged into THE TEN TENETS OF CRYPTOCURRENCIES.\n\nAccordingly, I hereby offer my full commitment and ask you to join this quest for standing out as the one project, one community to break the ever recurring Ponzi scheme cycle in crypto, which has been the ultimate failure of all crypto tokens to date. When we accomplish this feat, we will get the liquidity pair coin, KSM, to astronomical highs.\n\nThe revisions made on Clause 6 of the V-Paper, the market cap milestones, DO NOT in any way mean a concession from these ambitious goals; I am adamant on pursuing even beyond them. All the same, I find the feedback I got relevant in the sense that the target market caps based on which the whole project is to advance should be more comprehensive of the contingencies that the project may face in the field.\n\nConsequently, as seen in the revised Draft V-Paper, we decreased:\n\nThe Milestone 1 market cap (where 5% of the token’s max total supply to get unlocked to generate funds for CEX listings) from **$100M to $20M**;\n\nThe Milestone 2 market cap (where 5% of the token’s max total supply to get unlocked to generate funds for VC firm incorporation, management and legalities) from **$700M to $100M**;\n\nThe Milestone 3 market cap (where 30% of the token’s max total supply to get unlocked to generate funds for buying the target company stocks) from **$1B to $200M**.\n\n**QUESTION 2: IS THE TARGET COMPANY GOING TO BE A CRYPTOCURRENCY?**\n\nNo, it is going to be a traditional startup company. The whole proposition of the project is based on linking a cryptocurrency to a profit-making, non-Ponzi business, thus converting a crypto token to a legit financial instrument.\n\nSince there will need to be done a good deal of research and curation on the startups database for picking out the good ones that are at the stage of their pre-Series B funding round, for reasons specified in Clause 8 of the V-Paper, such specific tasks may be too much to ask from the community. But of course in any case, the VCAP DAO is to render the final decision. Other than that, I would love to instill an additional nomination by the DAO mechanism; however, the details will clarify in line with the community’s level of commitment and participation.\n\nThe startup company to be picked will most likely be a relatively high-profile unicorn company to reduce risk and make a worldwide sensation in the industry. For this purpose, one of Elon Musk’s companies would be great but unfortunately as of the moment they have all past their pre-Series B funding stage and already at very high valuations to be feasibly invested in.\n\n**QUESTION 3: IT’S AN ANONYMOUS NEW GUY, WHAT IF HE RUGS AND LEAVES?**\n\nI don’t consider myself new as I have been a large investor of DOT since 2022, but that’s beside the point since I haven’t been active; just been buying, staking, and observing.\n\nAs relevant to the topic, I worked in a law firm that consulted on a wide spectrum of matters, including capital markets and venture capital deals. Afterwards, I've had my own customer portfolio of major law firms and companies. As much as I will dedicate my knowledge and experience to the project, I’m not intending to use my professional background as an element within the scope of the project’s narratives. I am here to do new things, and go beyond.\n\nAnonymity is a long-standing tradition in the cryptocurrency space, with examples like Satoshi Nakamoto and Ryoshi demonstrating the trustworthiness of blockchain technology. The transparency of public ledgers and the decentralization of blockchain networks make government oversight unnecessary, allowing billions (if not trillions) of dollars to be entrusted to anonymous creators. Furthermore, anonymity adds an artistic dimension, attracting people through strong narratives and the intrigue of mystery.\n\nThat said, I am open to revealing my identity at any stage of the project if necessary. My only concern is that my real-world identity might fall short of the project’s ambitious vision, leading to an underwhelming perception. For instance, would a token founded by a \"John Smith\" resonate as strongly? Nonetheless, I recognize the importance of addressing concerns about anonymity.\n\nAs a safety measure, I had already included a commitment to public accountability in Clause 5 of the V-Paper. Accordingly, my wallet address will be announced, and it will be publicly verifiable that I have not sold any tokens, even if the project achieves very high market caps. This level of transparency will reinforce the project's unique position as a truly non-Ponzi arrangement.\n\nTo further appease concerns, I have also explored an additional solution with Daniel (of Virto Network):\n\n**TIMELOCKING** all VCAP tokens I hold for a period of **ONE YEAR**, as soon as they are in my wallet.\n\nThis measure will make it technically impossible for me to sell or transfer my tokens during that time. While I wouldn't mind locking my tokens for an even longer period since the token is designed to keep, if not further appreciate, its value indefinitely once an exit is made on the target company, I prefer to retain a degree of flexibility for unexpected twists at later stages of the project that may necessitate the use of my tokens in ways impossible to foresee at this time (e.g. an _ad hoc_ regulatory requirement to be ordered by a public authority); but in any case, the ultimate goal of securing the project’s best interests is to be prioritized.\n\nI am fully committed to leading this project through all milestones, as detailed in the V-paper, and breaking the Ponzi scheme stalemate that has plagued cryptocurrencies.\n\n**QUESTION 4: HOW WILL THE LEGALITIES AND FORMALITIES OF A SOPHISTICATED VENTURE CAPITAL BUSINESS BE HANDLED WITH SUCH A LOW FUNDING REQUEST? WILL HIGHER FUNDING BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE?**\n\nThis concern has already been addressed in Clauses 6 and 7 of the V-Paper. To highlight: Legalities and formalities will be resolved after achieving Milestone 2, which requires establishing a solid base above $100M market cap. At that stage, 5% of the VCAP token’s total max supply will be unlocked, generating sufficient funds to incorporate and manage the venture capital firm, as well as for hiring professionals and carrying out the necessary processes with the SEC.\n\nSimilarly, funds required to participate in the Series B round of the target company will be generated upon achieving Milestone 3 (market cap of $200M), when 30% of the token supply will be unlocked.\n\nIt is important to reiterate that no additional funds will be requested from the Treasury for these purposes. The project is designed to be financially self-sustaining and to advance based on predictable, predefined milestones.\n\n**QUESTION 5: AGAIN, THE FUNDS REQUESTED ARE MINIMAL, BUT THE PROJECT'S AMBITIONS ARE EXTREMELY HIGH. ARE YOU 100% CERTAIN YOU WON'T ASK FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE FUTURE?**\n\nI would love to respond with an unequivocal \"no\", but it’s important to be transparent and realistic.\n\nAs you might have noticed, it is true that the last thing I want is to ask for funds from the Treasury, and I want to keep my ask as minimal as possible.\n\nThe way I see it, the antidote to your concerns for the future is, again, foreseeability. Even though trying various and doing iterations in line with the results are the best way, if not the only way, to move forward any business, we can still establish a framework with impassable lines and **set it in stone**.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is, this project reaches its financial freedom once it achieves its Milestone 1; so once this project’s market cap establishes a solid base above $20M market cap, any kind of external funding can no longer be necessary.\n\nWith that in mind, THE PROJECT'S FUTURE POTENTIAL ASKS FROM THE TREASURY WILL IN ANY CASE REMAIN LIMITED TO THESE 2 ITEMS ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS:\n\n**1) INJECTING MORE LIQUIDITY FOR THE TOKEN:**\n\nWe are all aware that even a $5K initial liquidity can be enough for a token to eventually get to billions of market cap, there is no limit technically and mathematically since the liquidity increases with each buy. According to our researches and calculations, such a minimal initial liquidity, as asked with this proposal, should do fine.\n\nHowever, I believe we will need to observe the actual workings of swaps for a while, and see whether the minimality of the initial liquidity may cause any disfigurement in the structure and operability of the token in a way such as to jeopardize the future of the project. The safest way to take is to see how things work out in the field before ruling out any contingency for good.\n\nAccordingly, after this proposal (hopefully) gets approved, and we set up and list the token, and we observe the token swaps for a while and have a clearer picture on their implications, **I MAY OR MAY NOT** ask for an **ADDITIONAL $15K - $20K LIQUIDITY** to inject into the token’s liquidity pair.\n\nPLEASE NOTE THAT, IF I HAPPEN TO THEN SUBMIT SUCH A PROPOSAL, AND IF IT HAPPENS TO GET REJECTED, SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE WILL NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT OUR COMMITMENT AND EFFORTS TOWARDS THE MANIFESTED GOALS OF THE PROJECT, AND WE WILL NEVER, EVEN MENTALLY, DEEM SUCH REJECTION ANY KIND OF EXCUSE FOR ANYTHING.\n\n**2) TARGETED X ADS MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO BREAK OUT OF A POSSIBLE PROLONGED STAGNATION SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $5M AND $20M MARKET CAPS**\n\nFirst things first, I will never ask for any marketing budget from the Treasury as long as the token’s market cap remains below $5M; we will keep trying by developing better narratives to express ourselves, designing stronger materials, and building closer relationships with Kusama and Polkadot communities. This is how we are intending to get to the first milestone, to the $20M market cap, after which any need for external funding is to become irrelevant.\n\nBut if VCAP’s market cap happens to stagnate somewhere between $5M and $20M for a prolonged period, **I MAY OR I MAY NOT** ask for an I**NITIAL $10K - $20K** for trying out various target audiences and marketing materials on an X ads campaign, to observe the result metrics such as CPI and CPA, and see what works best, and how much marketing budget would be necessary to get to the Milestone 1, namely the $20M market cap. Accordingly, then, **I MAY OR MAY NOT** submit an additional proposal **for such amount to be calculated in line with the result metrics**, and carry out the X ads campaign if and when I get the additional funding.\n\nHopefully such a campaign will not be necessary, but if we are compelled to do it, I already have good ideas on what niche audiences to target on X, to get crypto people outside the Polkadot/Kusama community to install Nova wallet and start buying KSM and VCAP.\n\nAGAIN, PLEASE NOTE THAT, IF I HAPPEN TO THEN SUBMIT SUCH PROPOSAL(S), AND IF ANY OF THEM HAPPENS TO GET REJECTED, SUCH CIRCUMSTANCE WILL NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT OUR COMMITMENT AND EFFORTS TOWARDS THE MANIFESTED GOALS OF THE PROJECT, AND WE WILL NEVER, EVEN MENTALLY, DEEM SUCH REJECTION ANY KIND OF EXCUSE FOR ANYTHING.\n\n**OTHER THAN THE CONTINGENCIES AS DETAILED ABOVE, I WILL NOT ASK FOR ANY TREASURY SUBVENTION WHATSOEVER. THIS IS AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST.**\n\n**CONCLUSION:**\n\nI believe I have addressed all points that puzzled you about the project.\n\nPlease let me know if you need further clarification, I am at all times available to chat on Telegram (@ari\\_m\\_m), as I find written communication the healthiest since nothing gets lost in the shuffle, unlike the case with video and voice chats.\n\nLet me conclude my proposal by sharing some more:\n\nI don’t have a day job. I live off of my life savings, converted to cryptocurrencies, bringing forth profits through bear and bull cycles.\n\nI believe in progress and the future. I want the amazing blockchain tech to amount to much more than a toy at the hands of petty scammers and professional Ponzi artists.\n\nWe shall walk these uncharted territories to trailblaze new paths together.\n\nAnd it has begun. I already have amazing techies, designers, mentors with me. Here in Kusama.\n\nI am keen on working round the clock, as I have never been in my life, and all I need is a mutual feeling. An adoption. A perspective that the VCAP token is the bright child of the Kusama coin. Something analogous to a little genius to grow the family business.\n\nLet’s do this.\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing, here is the breakdown of the expenses I request from the Treasury:\n\n1— **160 KSM** as initial liquidity on Kusama Asset Hub for the Token's VCAP/ KSM liquidity pair,\n\n2— **8.5 KSM** as the fee for updating the Token's information on Dexscreener, as detailed on [https://marketplace.dexscreener.com/product/token-info,](https://marketplace.dexscreener.com/product/token-info,) \n\n3— **1.5 KSM** to buy domain name for the Token's website,\n\n4— **5 KSM** as one-year X Premium+ subscription fee for the Token's X account.\n\n**Total Requested Amount: 175 KSM**",

As solution, I have decided to employ my experience in venture capital deals for bridging a crypto token to a profit-making, sustainable business within the framework of the experimental sister Kusama network of the Polkadot ecosystem, that stands out from other networks with its exceptional scalability and interoperability features, as well as its functioning DAO and vibrant community.  \n\nDuring my quests recently, in a Polkassembly discussion [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2581](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2581) I feel blessed to have encountered Daniel (@danielo), the founder of the Virto Network with his emphasis on building DAO tools on Kusama network, to shortly team up with him as solution partners. In time, I am looking forward to further participation to ensure adoption of the project by the community.\n\nIn consideration of the foregoing, here is the breakdown of the expenses I request from the Treasury:\n\n1— 160 KSM as initial liquidity on Kusama Asset Hub for the Token's VCAP/ KSM liquidity pair,\n\n2— 8.5 KSM as the fee for updating the Token's information on Dexscreener, as detailed on [https://marketplace.dexscreener.com/product/token-info](https://marketplace.dexscreener.com/product/token-info), [](https://marketplace.dexscreener.com/product/token-info)\n\n3— 1.5 KSM to buy domain name for the Token's website,\n\n4— 5 KSM as one-year X Premium+ subscription fee for the Token's X account.\n\n**Total Requested Amount:** 175 KSM",

      "content": "The four accounts on this proposal made extrinsics in the past that lost funds due to bugs in the runtime at that time. The extrinsics were: [1](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/21678807-20), [2](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/21577634-3), [3](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/21734857-2) and [4](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/21605077-2)\n\nYou can see that each has a `polkadotXcm.Attempted` event which shows that it failed, however, there should be a `polkadotXcm.AssetsTrapped` event too. This was due to a bug that the assets were not trapped and therefore lost. This bug was present in the version used in these extrinsics, 1.1.0 of Kusama. The accounts attempted to cross-chain transfer all their funds and didn't have enough to pay for delivery fees, since they were taken from the account itself. This was fixed in version 1.1.2, after changes from [PR 3085](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3085) were included.\n\nSince these funds were lost due to a bug, they should be reimbursed, while extrinsics where assets were trapped (not included in this proposal) can be reclaimed.",

I've created technical content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuruz8W__WIFf1Uu6m6yXpA) designed to provide a smooth onboarding experience for developers into the Substrate working environment. **My goal is to attract more developers to the Kusama ecosystem** in the long term, resulting in more projects and investments.\n\nCurrently, there's not a lot of content on how to work with Substrate. While Parity offers proficient-level videos, I noticed a gap in beginner-friendly content. That's why I decided to create videos that explain complicated terms and concepts in simple words.\n\nBelow are the titles and short descriptions of the three videos I've launched, along with links to each. Please check them out and let me know your thoughts:\n\nPolkadot SDK, Substrate, FRAME, Pallets, and Their Structure - For Beginners.\nWatch [here](https://youtu.be/kp0m_NQyVPU): In this video, I explain the Polkadot ecosystem's developer environment, including Polkadot SDK, Substrate, FRAME, and Pallets, to give you a basic understanding of these components.\n\nPolkadot & Kusama Ecosystems Terminology for Beginners.\nWatch [here](https://youtu.be/ubzXaLEzkUw): This video is a trivia session where I provide definitions of the core terms needed to start working in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\nBalances Pallet and Assets Pallet of Substrate - Explained for Beginners.\nWatch [here](https://youtu.be/Z3bY8jNxfEE): In this video, I discuss the Balances and Assets Pallets of the Substrate framework (Polkadot SDK), their similarities and differences, when to use each, and the basic concepts you need to understand when working with these Pallets.\n\nI am requesting a tip of 110 KSM for the work already done.",

      "title": "Customized Kusama Chocolate Bars | Proof of Taste - 2nd Edition for Polkadot Decoded",
      "content": "Since the [Proof of Taste customized Kusama/Polkdaot chocolate bars](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/99) were well received last year, I'd like to manage the production of a 2nd Proof of Taste edition.\n\nThe graphic designer designed a couple of designs last year, of which only one was chosen and finally used for the 1st edition of Proof of Taste chocolate. Hence, we have some designs left, which we can use, without paying the graphic designer again ($500 dollar payment back then).\n\nAfter talking and brainstorming with Adam Steeber, we/he came up with the idea to produce a bigger batch and share them at Polkadot Decoded. Hence the request for a bigger KSM amount compared to last time.\n\nMy learning from the first edition was that i underestimated the shipping costs to remote places around the world. With the requested amount of 150KSM (approximately $4500/€4175) we'll be able to order around 250 editions and still be able to ship some boxes via mail if requested. \n\nInstead of shipping all the chocolate all around the world like last time, my plan is to keep a certain amount (for example 75%) of the boxes for Polkadot Decoded 2024 in Brussels. They can be given away randomly at the event or maybe we can arrange some kind of lottery.\nI'm happy to hear your ideas about how to share them to the Decoded audience in a fun and exciting way :)\n\nI talked with the team behind the organisation of Decoded and they told me that i can ship the batch to their warehouse and from there they would take over the shipment to Brussels for Polkadot Decoded. This will help me a lot to manage the logistics of the bulky and heavy order.\n\nWith having the majority of the boxes in Brussels for Decoded, we can share them easier and for less costs to visitors of the event and I guess it's a cool story to bring our own branded chocolate to Brussels, which is known for its premium chocolate!\n\nEstimated costs:\n\n- €2230 for chocolate manufacturing, 250 boxes each two chocolate bars (without VAT)\n- €415 for chocolate bar packaging for 500 chocolate bars in total (without VAT)\n- €189 for box packaging for 250 boxes (without VAT)\n- €541 for shipping & handling costs to Decoded warehouse & individual users  (without VAT)\n- €800 for 0,19% VAT for German tax authorities\n\n∑ €4175 / $4500 / 150 KSM (~$30)\n\nThanks to Coinstudio, Adam Clay Steeber, & I Love Crypto for their direct support to help me set up this proposal! \nAnd thanks to all the voters and recipients of the last years edition, who helped make it happen and provided positive feedback about the tasty chocolate! \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCouple of links about the history and build of for this proposal:\n\n--> Polkassembly discussion published before this proposal was released [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2631)\n\n--> see original polkassembly posting and discussion for the 1st edition in 2023 [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2406)\n\n--> copy of the link to the full proposal from last year for 1st edition can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vn8IP-YyvTWWDvzMI6JJIDn_ZAVSi9OC/view)\n\n--> Link to manufacturer [here](https://www.zotter.at/en/your-edition/your-personalised-design)\n\n--> check out last years 1st edition [here](https://medium.com/@babespapes/proof-of-taste-9702cac7bd9f)",

Hence, we have some designs left, which we can use, without paying the graphic designer again ($500 dollar payment back then).\n\nI would ask again for the same amount like last year ($2200 - currently around 50 KSM), to cover the manufacturing costs for +100 editions and shipping costs for users, who'd like to get the chocolate delivered to their homes or offices. My learning from the first edition was that i underestimated the shipping costs to remote places around the world. With the amount of $2200 we'll be able to order more than 100 editions and I will be covered with shipping costs, too.\n\nInstead of shipping all the chocolate all around the world like last time, my idea is to keep half of the boxes for Polkadot decoded 2024 in Brussels. They can be given away randomly at the event or maybe we can arrange some kind of lottery. I will either ship them to the organisers beforehand or bring them my self.

This allows for proposals with advanced features and [multi-stage payouts](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-treasury#creating-a-staged-proposal-with-validfrom).\n\nThis proposal aims to test the whole pipeline through a batch call with these three calls totaling **3 KSM** in payouts from Kusama Asset Hub Treasury.\n\n(1)   1 KSM to be transferred after the proposal gets enacted (`validFrom ` is set to `None`)\n\n(2)  1 KSM to be made available for claiming after block number 23105000 (approximately 14 days after submitting this proposal)\n\n(3)  1 KSM to be made available for claiming after block number 23255000 (approximately 24 days after submitting this proposal)\n\nA follow-up proposal will be created to issue a [void call](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-guides-treasury#proposing-a-void-for-a-staged-proposal) to the third payout.\n\nI am the Technical Education Lead at Web3 Foundation, and I have a verified ID. \n\nI sent the Kusama Asset Hub Treasury **2 KSM** already [https://assethub-kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/6856102-2](https://assethub-kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/6856102-2). Given that the third payout of 1 KSM will be voided,  the balance checks out. If for some reason, I end up getting that extra KSM, I will return the funds to the Asset Hub treasury immediately after receiving them. This proposal serves as a template for future proposals that want multi-stage payouts.",

Our passion lies not just in the technology and architecture of Polkadot, but we also believe as its one of few, or even the only future-proof ecosystem. Basically, if you’re in the crypto for long-term, you've got no other place to go except Polkadot - just joking! Or maybe not?\n\nThat’s why we came to Polkadot. Initially, we started The Dots to make memes, but soon we realised that its’ potential lays far beyond than just meme posting, but fully potential entertainment/technical Polkadot newspaper and media.\n\n### What is The Dots?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheDotsMagazine\n\nPolkadot non-nerdy entertainment news media. Our main goal is to highlight recent ecosystem updates, educate people about Polkadot and explain complex things in an easy language. We’re creating Polkadot news media for normies, who’s just joined the crypto and wants to know more about Polkadot and its parachains. Using the internet language, power of memes and humour is the best way to onboard new users into such complex things as crypto.\n\n\n### Who are We? \n\nJohn Mental ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Web3Promoteam)), a Polkadot Senior Ambassador, Web3 content creator and contributor to the ecosystem since 2020.

Ambassador at Polimec and Candidate at Phala Network. Just cool and dedicated. \n\n### What have we done so far? \n\nWe started our journey in January and at the moment of publishing the proposal, we gained 1.1k Twitter followers which is a very solid achievement (all our audience is 100% live and organic). \n\nWe published series of Blitz videos during the Sub0 Polkadot Asia to show that Polkadot is also about fun and how people in the community are passionate about it, so far we’re receiving only positive feedback and we’re happy to move forward, the Treasury funding will allow us to produce more professional and quality content, as we’ll be able to dedicate more time to our project and involve more people in the production.

Two full interviews with Jay Chrawna and Alice_und_Bob are finished and set into the pipeline for this week. \n\n_______________________________________________\n\n**Requested KSM**: 235.4209 KSM\n$10,000.00 in equivalent of KSM for 6 month of operational work  \n\nAverage KSM price for the last 7D: 42.4771\n\n**Working hour**: 30$ \n\n**Total working hours per week**: 14 hours per week (including expenses on part-time production team) \n\n**Total**: 336 hours, not including brainstorms, community calls, Twitter and governance research and other stuff.\n\n[Full Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18a8qbzz5lI-Zvd0jIBBNu3EvKDE8AQXSI6nkUCvChPo/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

Our implemented features include OpenGov Activity Monitoring, displaying new vote activities in real-time, and providing a monthly overview of OpenGov, voters, and the treasury. This will be instrumental in attracting those interested in OpenGov, whether they are new to the concept or seeking funding for their web3 projects. We aim to build a vibrant and active community of developers within the web3 space.\n\nAs we move forward, we will continue to refine and expand our project, ensuring that Polkadot OpenGov becomes a central hub for decentralized decision-making and community involvement.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal, and we look forward to contributing to the growth and success of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nBest regards, Ashutosh Singh (Project Creator and Head, Polkadot OpenGov Observer)",

      "content": "The project involves creating graffiti artworks featuring the Kusama logo in various cities, commencing with Barcelona. The process encompasses designing a template, and paint it with black spray in urban locations. Each graffiti piece will then be photographed and transformed into a non-fungible token (NFT), minted on the Kusama blockchain.\n\nIn the future, we anticipate individuals utilizing our template to make their own graffiti in different cities, financed by the treasury and upload it to the blockchain. Each graffiti point needs to be geolocated, enabling visits to these locations as if they were sanctuaries during travels. A symbolic gesture of reverence—bending the knee in front of the Kusama logo—is encouraged. Cities must have a population exceeding 2,000,000, and once a city is adorned, it cannot be repeated.\n\nInspired by Foucault's analysis of panopticism as a power mechanism, we propose subverting this paradigm. Placing the Kusama logo strategically in urban settings transforms it into a symbol of rebellion—an inversion of the panoptic gaze. Each graffiti piece disrupts passive surveillance, converting public spaces into active sites of resistance. Drawing further inspiration from Paul B. Preciado, our graffiti project becomes a performative act challenging conventional discourse surrounding public space.\n\nTo sum up: A swift template of the KSM logo, creating graffiti, capturing it in a photo, uploading the NFT on StateMine, and geolocating it for others to visit and bend the knee.\n\nAllocation:\n\n·        Idea: 69 KSM\n\nRisk+Expenses: 42 KSM (spray, template, time etc..)\n\nWe propose these rules for participants in this Project for the first 10 cities:\n\n·        42 KSM (max allocation)\n\n·        City must be >2,000,000 population or the most populated city in the country. (for example: Vatican City)\n\n·        Can’t repeat cities\n\n·        Photo of the NFT. Upload it and geolocate it.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/g6JmpF7/OIG-E8-Wc2pi-CDWKip.jpg)",

      "title": "Proposal: 12 Week Rust course at FIIT STU in Bratislava",
      "content": "## Dear Kusama community,\n\n**Allow me to introduce you to our [proposal for 12 Week long Rust academic course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl8aR70PY5LxCUjE9LgncuEQzwT4xZq4kZ-M1_xll18/edit?usp=sharing) held on [Faculty of Informatics and Information technologies, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html?page_id=749).**\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\n\nThe proposal aims to establish Rust course at Faculty of Informatics and Information technologies in Bratislava. It covers costs of special guests as well as costs for video. The expected outcome is to create an experienced Rust team capable of working on Dotsama ecosystem projects. This will benefit both our University and the ecosystem. Our faculty has an entire research group that focuses on Blockchain. Recently, we had an idea of forming a Rust course. This course aims to gain a team of Rust developers who can help us work on projects and innovations for Dotsama ecosystem. As we know, getting motivated developers into the ecosystem is a very hard task nowadays.\n\n### High-level goals for students\n\n1.  Ability to write custom CLI/server applications using popular crates or to contribute to existing projects\n    \n2.  Get practical, hands-on experience, so that students can create and write their own projects\n    \n3.  Deep dive, intermediate-level Rust skill\n    \n4.  Understand the problems Rust aims to solve\n    \n5.  Ability to judge whether Rust fits project requirements\n    \n6.  Understand why Rust features are the way they are\n    \n\n### Course structure\n\n-   7 modules\n    \n-   12 weeks, 1 lecture of 90 minutes and 1 tutorial of 90 minutes per week\n    \n-   1 exercise set per lecture, to be completed during tutorial or at home\n    \n-   1 final project with a small report to be completed during the mentoring session or at home\n    \n\n**More details on course and each individual lecture can be seen in full proposal document below.**\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n-   Discussion: 9. Oct. 2023 - 15. Oct. 2023\n-   Voting: 16. Sept. 2023 - 29. Oct. 2023\n\n## Documents associated with this proposal:\n\n**[Full proposal (Contains detailed information on course structure)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl8aR70PY5LxCUjE9LgncuEQzwT4xZq4kZ-M1_xll18/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n[**Delivery document (with Youtube video to lecture, photos of hanged posters at the faculty,  Github repo with all course materials)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-X9pQEGhotrfbTrLCZo2_MdhOuAE9QvjtzjQGsUzW0/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "Dear Kusama Community,\n\nThis is a follow-up of the failed [Polkadot referendum 75](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/75). We are requesting 332.9 KSM (**6,061 USD** at today's prices) in order to be compensated for the delivery of a critical infrastructure service to DOT and KSM ecosystems earlier this year.\n\n[Polkashots.io](https://polkashots.io/) was the first snapshot service for validators and node operators available since Early 2021. During its time, it provided a valuable service to validators and Parity engineers alike, that ensured reliability of our network.\n\n[Warp Sync](https://spec.polkadot.network/chap-networking#sect-msg-warp-sync) made snapshot services redundant, therefore we stopped our service in April 2023. It stands ready to be activated again [shall the need arise](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/7661).\n\nOur [previous Kusama treasury proposal](238) was accepted, however it did not entirely cover our costs, hence we are submitting this final one.  For more information, please refer to the [full proposal doc](https://hackmd.io/@nicolasochem/B19RK5lmh).",

Unification of XCM pallets which are currently very diverse can bring ease of integration and speed up dApp development significantly. This Polkadot forum post goes to show, that developers actively search for such tools. [link](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/grant-ideas-and-wishlists/399)\n\n**Links that might interest you:**\n\nLink to the pre-proposal discussion held between 20.May-27.May: [Polkassembly](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2577), [Subsquare](https://kusama.subsquare.io/post/9)\n\nWe do not hide anything from you, yes we failed last time - This proposal was proposed once already, but we requested 5 months of funding paid at once which did not seem to be appreciated by the community - [link to the previous proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/209). This time we decided to be much more transparent and propose referenda each month for the next 5 months so voters can see if funds are used according to the description we provided and decide about further funding. We hope, that this will show the community, that we really mean it with ParaSpell and we won't let it fail because we believe the project is very needed in the ecosystem.\n\nXCM SDK - [link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\nAn organization with all repositories - [link](https://github.com/paraspell)\n\nOur previous Kusama treasury funding - [link](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/123)\n\nDelivery of Kusama treasury funded proposal - [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lMY_8EtQ41IX7Zn9VIMAiG1k3oLYN0h_lVj8dWDwZ_k/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur current metrics can be seen here - [link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/239685371-84a5214e-ccc6-41c8-b551-7ff655304501.png) , our SDK is also implemented by the biggest Polkadot NFT marketplace called KodaDot.\n\n**Further information** on the maintenance mechanism, management of the funds and budget can be found in the [maintenance proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIHTKMcsWC6VGg1I-dz--5JLAk0GbKv8ZpZciek-awA/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "OpenCommunity Governance - Proposal Audit Reports",
      "content": "Dear Kusama community,\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of [two previous milestone proposals ](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2431)aimed at improving the Kusama OpenGov. The first proposal, Milestone 0, addressed OpenGov issues by developing a proposal and audit templates, initiating community discussions, and creating audit reports. The second proposal, Milestone 0.5, expanded the initial project by introducing the program to onboard additional proposal Auditors to enhance the decentralization and accuracy of score results.\n\nIn the previous period, we successfully completed a total of 54 audits, of which 19 were conducted by auditor candidates. One of the candidates, [Abdulbee](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/165) successfully completed the full auditor onboarding process being approved by Kusama community via an on-chain OpenGov tip.\n\n**Problem**\n\nAn additional challenge in the current proposal evaluation process is the lack of constructive feedback during the discussion phase. To address this, appointed auditors will shift their focus by becoming more involved in the earlier phases of proposal development. This proactive approach will help proposers receive feedback and address potential weaknesses in their proposals before they are submitted onchain, giving them time to evaluate the feedback and make improvements.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nIn **Milestone 1**, the primary objective is to continue onchain proposal audits, further expand Auditor tasks, continue collaboration with Polkassembly and introduce Auditor and Reviewer roles.\n\nTo ensure transparency and community involvement, our main goal is to transfer the Audit process to the Kusama community. This will be achieved by moving the Audit report work to the **post-paid OpenGov Tips,** where approved auditors will be compensated for their efforts. This approach ensures fairness and accountability in the process while keeping it open to the community.\n\nIn this proposal, we present the continuation of the Audit team work, with the aim to deliver Audit Reports for 60 treasury proposals over a period of 2 months. Our goal is to ensure that these proposals receive the evaluation and feedback they deserve. All work will be post-paid through self-submitted tips, with auditors initiating self-tips for their completed proposal audits. To avoid overloading the treasury track, a tip must cover compensation for a minimum of 5 audit reports.\n\nTo effectively evaluate project proposals using the Audit Template, it is essential to have an objective and standardized grading system in place. The following grading criteria are taken into consideration by the audit team when creating audit reports on proposals\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/PmkpVMD/Screenshot-2023-04-20-at-11-05-51.png)\n\n**Milestone 1.5** is a continuation of [Referenda #67 - Proposal Extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RcWEpT5C1u4dNUH4EWCaJfpQ4qOGV19AMXPwj8qSWeY/edit#heading=h.e126djyh5msy) with the goal to continue education and onboarding of additional community auditors. \n\nAll details can be found in the [Full proposal.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12dT6RWkiChINTADRnQQuYHLZK_coDPdq/view?usp=sharing)\n\nProposal [Discussion topic](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2562)\n\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hello community members, I am learning polkadot and substrate-related codes recently, and I am very interested in the design and engineering implementation of polkadot, but I found that I did not find a suitable IDE. I am a serious Neovim editor dependency, not very I am used to traditional IDEs such as vscode, clion, and IntelliJ IDEA. We know that Neovim has a huge user base. Its profile can be customized and takes up very little resources, so I combined the community plug-in to create an out-of-the-box IDE for developing substrates. Some typical functions are integrated, such as file search, code navigation, DAP debugging function, fuzzy search, LSP, GIT, etc. This should help community members who want to learn more about substrate and rely on neovim to get started with the polkadot ecosystem faster.\nHere are the project links: [subNvim](https://github.com/punkMux/subNvim)\nI heard that the polkadot community has good treasury incentives, so I am applying for funds here. I am very grateful for the support of the community. I will refine the IDE tool, and continue to delve into the polkadot ecology, create more tools that are useful to the community. thanks for the support again.\n",

The Tip was submitted through OpenGov at a time where OpenGov was just kicking off in Kusama with a submission deposit (non-refundable) very high (100 KSM). \n\nLike other proposals submitted around the same time, the enactment period was erroneous set. Because of that, the proposal was one of the recently cancelled by [Referendum #122](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/122).\n\nThis new proposal aims to resubmit the Tip previously approved by the community plus (similar to what other proposals did when submitting the replacement proposals) the reimbursement value of the submission deposit that was locked in the previous proposal [BigTipper #7](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/7).\n\nThis proposal is made of a batch call with two treasury spend calls:\n\n1. 5 KSM related to the value of the original Tip with beneficiary MathCrypto.\n2. 100 KSM related to the reimbursement of the submission deposit with beneficiary TurboFlakes.\n\nThank you for your votes and please feel free to leave your comments below.\n\nBest,\n\npaulo // turboflakes.io",

The milestones leading to completing the goals of this proposal are as follows:  \n  \n1-Finalize design of papercraft model and packaging design 100% 2-Acquire necessary equipment and materials 100% 3-Develop educational files and instructions 100% 4-Production 100% 5-Mint 100 units of NFT 100% 6-Assemble packages 100% 7-Deliver packages to Parity offices 100% 8-Unexpected delays \\*\\*On time\\*\\*  \n  \nFollow the link for the \\[full v2 proposal\\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iA41Z0V4\\_EL24WnWIADQIbLBZRZLvyDNsp1KsMQ7ZrU/edit?usp=sharing) Follow us on \\[Twitter\\](https://twitter.com/KsmPaperCraft) to witness the evolution of our creation process!  \n  \nDeadline set for 20/06/2023  \n  \n\\*\\*Updates\\*\\* We will be updating weekly. We will also be updating our meters to let everyone know our current progress in a glimpse. 31/03/2023 Funds received and already converted. 01/04/2023 We attended the Handmade '23 fair to get some information about cutting machines and materials. As we scrutinize more the project, we realize that the hours invested will be many and the necessary material will be more expensive than we thought, but we assume it and face the project with enthusiasm! 04/04/2023 Setting up the templates. First materials tests. 06/04/2023 Hired a local experimental electronic musician to make the sounds for our NFT. He works with Digitone, Digitakt, Microgranny 2.5, Micromonsta 2, Korg Opsix. \\*\\*Significant milestone: we just mint the first NFT of the collection.\\*\\* 10/04/2023 Submitted the necessary files and bought 10 rmrk to verify our NFT collection in singular. 11/04/2023 Final measurements Flaps 5mm->8mm. Height 182 mm Width 325 mm Still designing the templates. 12/04/2023 Bought 500 cardboards. Cutting machine. Cutting mats. Blades. Sketch pens. Software. Other accesories. 13/04/2023 Just started the design and writing of the Folding Instructions. \\*\\*Significant milestone\\*\\* To gamify the crafting process we designed and mint the Craft Master collection. Craft Master is a non-fungible token that serves as evidence of the successful assembly of the Kusama Papercraft. This digital asset confirms that the intricate papercraft has been meticulously constructed or attempted, showcasing the creativity and craftsmanship of its owner. Owning a Craft Master NFT not only confirms the completion or attempt of the Kusama papercraft but also grants the owner a unique digital token that can be cherished, displayed, or shared with others. It represents a digital badge of honor, symbolizing the creativity, skill, and determination of its possessor. \\[Link to the NFT\\](https://singular.app/collectibles/kusama/5e79eeb999b849454b-CRAFTMASTER/17466555-5e79eeb999b849454b-CRAFTMASTER-CRAFT\\_MASTER-00000001) 17/04/2023 Still performing tests with the materials. We will change the packaging. The ones we tested are too flexible. 20/04/2023 \\*\\*Significant milestone\\*\\* We started the production of the papercraft. 2/4 designs of the papercraft finished. Meanwhile we are finishing the instructions. We are trying to make the assemble as easy as possible. 24/04/2023 Printing and precuting the templates. Slow process. We are already way over the hours we planned in the proposal, but we've come up with some good ideas to make the assemble less difficult. 26/04/2023 4/4 of the designing templates completed. Minting completed. 27/04/2023 Production of the templates finished 02/05/2023 Made a linktr.ee. Working on educational files. Changing the packaging design to fit a new harder envelope (300g) 10/05/2023 There were some issues with the package printer, so we are looking for another one. That could take 10 days. We just contact other suppliers and boughts some tests. 15/05/2023 Instructions and educational files done. 27/05/2023 Unfortunately there was a printing error in the packages so we have to made them again (all the 100 units). We sent the files but the printer didn't verify them correctly. It's frustating and expensive but we will assume it. We will need to change the deadline (2 weeks more). 12/06/2023 Everything solved. Packing. 23/06/2023 \\[Link to Project report\\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1137x9LJZNcG3sNrqlHDHtgzxD7hNnImv4dy53OTIsRk/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Customized Kusama Chocolate Bars",
      "content": "**CUSTOMIZED KUSAMA CHOCOLATE BARS** \n\n**1.General Project Information** \n\n**Short description:**  customized chocolate bars to make Kusama tangible and to give it a touch of lifestyle\n\n\n\n**2. Context** \n\nAfter having a short discussion about this idea with Bill at Polkadot decoded last June, he gave me confidence to try to propose this idea here at the Kusama treasury.\n\nThe motivation for this idea comes from the digital nature of blockchain making it hard to grasp in the analogue world and hence not being tangible. The logo and branding of Kusama or Polkadot should be present on daily goods to make it easier for users to connect emotionally not only visually, but for example also through flavor, sound, or touch. I believe giving Kusama or Polkadot a touch of lifestyle would be a great differentiator to other blockchains out there and in the digital world, with all its noise it’s very hard to stand out only with nice branding and logos on social media.\n\n\n**3.Problem** \n\nWhat all the blockchain projects out there have in common, is that they only market and brand themselves in the digital world, but not in the analogue real world. The attention span on social media is very short and with all the noise it’s very hard for users to connect emotionally to a blockchain project, except if they are token holders, fan boys/girls, or team members of the project.\nHow can we attract new users to Polkadot/Kusama and keep existing users connected and attracted to Polkadot/Kusama, without digital marketing methods like air drops, online quizzes, virtual meetings, NFT drops, or online ads on social media?\n\nI guess that one method which has proven itself in the last year to make users get emotionally attached to Polkadot, are real life events like Decoded or Sub0. Merchandise is also a good tool, but unfortunately it lacks creativity and by now we probably all have enough black t-shirts with a boring text logo in standard font in our wardrobe. \n\nProducing real world lifestyle products for Kusama/Polkadot should help with brand awareness and long term connectivity to new users and existing users, who value physical products that can be experienced through touch, taste, visual appearance, scent and hence motivate user to interact with Kusama/Polkadot and use the provided tools like staking, governance, minting NFTs, community growth, etc.\n\n**4.Proposal** \n\nKusama/Polkadot branded chocolate bars with custom packaging design to promote Kusama and Polkadot and other parachains with QR codes for example. These chocolate gift boxes can be used for:\n\nKusama/Polkadot gift tool (https://gifts.kusama.network/#/): receiver of gifted KSM/DOT can chose to receive the chocolate gift box by providing an address\nRegular attendees of Meet Up’s or Twitter spaces who prove attendance with POAP’s\nBusiness partners or investors to make them aware of projects building on top of Kusama/Polkadot\nGive away on real life events like Polkadot Decoded to special guests, supporters or volunteers\n\n\n**4.8. Key deliverables** \n\nGraphic design for product packaging\nProduction of chocolate bars with custom packaging\nShipping to various partners: Parity, W3F, Parachains\nDistribution of product at events\nCollecting and analyzing feedback of users\n\n**4.9. Objectives/Success criteria** \n\nWhen the product is successfully produced, packaging design is matching the digital draft, partners are receiving their batches and users are having a smile on their faces after trying the chocolate, then we know that goals were achieved!\n\n\n--> **see original polkassembly posting and discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2406)** \n\n--> **COPY OF LINK TO FULL PROPOSAL [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vn8IP-YyvTWWDvzMI6JJIDn_ZAVSi9OC/view?usp=share_link)** \n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n**1st update on 11th of March 2023:**\n\n- funds were received form treasury and transferred to exchanged to convert to €\n- payment to graphic designer of 13KSM (~$500) was transferred \n- requested and received various graphic elements from W3F, which were not publicly available\n- design for chocolate box and chocolate bars is in final stage\n- unfortunately the selection of chocolate flavour is not as wide as initially believed ([see poll](https://tinyurl.com/bd2x8937)) and according to the supplier, they can only offer flavours which are [regularly produced on the line](https://www.zotter.at/eigene-edition/ihre-firmenschokoladen/handgeschoepfte-schokolade)\n\n--------------------\n**2nd and final update on 2nd of May 2023:**\n\n- 100 pieces of chocolate boxes were shipped and received today\n- costs for production were paid (invoice available in shared folder)\n- all the design files are available in shared folder (proof of work of graphic designer)\n- proof of payment for graphic designer available as screen shot in shared folder \n- preparation and shipment of boxes to users happening now\n- shared folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-3tZwa9H9PcxEEkxkBModP8kjrfcJw4?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-3tZwa9H9PcxEEkxkBModP8kjrfcJw4?usp=sharing)\n\nenjoy the yummy Polkadot/Kusama chocolate!!!\n",

      "title": "Keep Evrloot running for the players after recent gas calculation changes",
      "content": "We need Kusama Treasury funding to keep our game running after recent changes in fee calculation. Who are we? We are Evrloot. The first RPG based on RMRK NFTs that managed to deliver a playable game. By sending your souls (thats what we call our in game characters) to wallets of ours, you can start missions that can yield rewards in the form of new NFTs. We have minted over 90% of all existing RMRK NFTs on Kusama to date and 99% of them come from rewards that players got from going on missions. There are approximately 2000 missions started each day. With the recent changes in fee calculation by Gavin Wood himself in referendum 254 (https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/254) our game was forced to shut down almost immediately. With an active playerbase of around 120 players, we had daily minting fees of around 1 KSM. Earning royalties from our NFTs was barely enough to cover those costs. But since fees increased by a factor of 10, we are not able to maintain our game anymore. Since there is no way for us to let the players mint the NFTs for themselves without Smart Contracts or Pallets, we need to do it for them and cover the costs. We also dont want to charge the players for playing the game. We are not talking about some cents, but multiple dollars per day to play a blockchain game. To give some perspective on how much it would cost the players if they were to cover: A player with 2 Souls and an average of 4 Missions/soul/day and two trades would be paying around 2.8$/daily (ca. 1,2$ for missions + 0.80$ for sending souls and resources + 0.80$ for trading) A player with 10 souls and an average of 8 Missions/soul and five trades around 22$/daily These costs are too high in our opinion and after a vote in our discord server, the community agrees. The proposed 333 KSM would last for approximetly 1 month. After that we would need to reapply for funding. With the advancements in RMRK 3.0 on Smart Contracts we are soon migrating to Moonbeam to hopefully find a even bigger playerbase and further decentralize. This means the funding would be applied for the period between now and the migration to Moonbeam. The KSM from the treasury would be used to pay the gas fees required to keep the game running. So its entirety would go back into the system. Never heard of us? Visit our website under evrloot.com or take a look at our game under game.evrloot.com Additional comment on concerns from voters posted here for visibility: Hi Adam, first of all, happy new years to you and everyone reading this. I hope it will be a great one for everybody.This will be my last response to this topic. While I like the idea of discussions, this is taking up too much time and space in my mind. It is hindering me on what I actually want to do, which is building and delivering to the people. Building not only benefits our players, but the space and Kusama as a whole and wasting energy on discussions like this will not get us anywhere. I can only repeat it again: This proposal is not a compensation for our efforts of pushing the boundries of Kusama and RMRK, this is simply a proposal to help us bench the costs for a short transition period, where not a single cent goes into our pockets, but everything comes full circle in the ecosystem. I am more than happy to have you in a public twitter space or in a discord call, so reach out if you are willing to do that. Anyway, let me go through your claims one by one. „I find it haughty to think RMRK is the sole reason for governance activity on Kusama. It certainly helped bring user into the ecosystem but it's not the one thing bringing all users to Kusama.“ I never said RMRK is the sole reason for governance activity. But I am pretty sure even you will agree, that governance participation will not noticeably increase with even greater advancements of technology on a chain, but rather by people who love products that live on a chain and are passionate about being a part of governing the ecosystem those products live in. Non technical people dont care as much about the tech as we do, they want to enjoy their experiences and be a part of something that feels fun and they can identify with. „Let me get this straight, you want Kusama to front the bill for a small minority of token holders to continue farming rewards from your game until you can migrate your whole userbase away from Kusama and onto Moonbeam? Why should KSM holders vote to fund anything with an explicit plan to abandon the chain?“ The game is on Kusama, the players are on Kusama. The fees are paid on the Kusama chain. I am not sure what your point is here. Would your opinion change if we had 1000 players? Would that player base be big enough to rationalize it for you? This gives me real - being rude to the waiter but extra friendly when the restaurant owner comes to the table - vibes, maybe thats just me though. Like you already said, we are migrating because our operations turned out to be unsustainable over night, and we are migrating. Make of that what you want. We love the dotsama space and the tech behind it. We could probably go to Ethereum and earn a multiple of revenue than we are doing right now, because we are actually delivering something. But we love the ecosystem and the people here and at least for me Kusama and Polkadot is one big family „You are quite literally asking for funding. All because you're using the funds in a certain way doesn't mean you're not asking for funding.“ I could have worded that better. What I meant was that we are not asking for funding of our project and the time cost that is involved in that. We are not asking for thousands of development hours being compensated with 100+$ each. And trust me, there are thousands of hours put into Evrloot. „While I agree the fee change was jarring and was sort of a \"rider bill\" on Referendum 14, it certainly wasn't something that came with only 3 hours notice - very misleading. Referendum 14 was submitted at block #15,657,166 and was approved at block #15,680,413 for a total time of 41 hours. If you're going with the first publication of the fee change, Gavin merged the change on December 4th 10:51am UTC, nearly 5 days before it was enacted on-chain. Also, if you remember in ~Q2 of 2021, the fees were reduced 10x when KSM was worth 10 times its current price. To say you weren't expecting this fee to return to its original amount after KSM lost 10x its value is, with all due respect, simply naïve. It was written on the walls.“ I agree that we could go through each and every proposal that gets published and probably even follow Gavins commits on github and try to understand every line he writes. But in practice, this is not what we do. One the one hand because there are only 24 hours in a day and every person in our team is working a full time job „on the side“. On the other hand I dont feel like this should be our responsibility. Isnt this what the whole Parachain thought is about? Having something you can trust on, build on top and dont have to waste pressure time on. I am personally relatively new to this space and did not expect the fees to 10x, maybe I should have, looking out for stuff like this in the future. We are trying really hard to be as up to date in this space as we can, but it feels overwhelming even for us.Your argument that there would have been anything we could have moved in this proposal is just as naïve as our thought that a test chain is there to allow people to test stuff and not constantly worry about running out of KSM to pay gas fees.  „Claim: Evrloot has minted 90% of all existing RMRK NFTs Truth: This figure is actually ~35%, yet unique holders of Evrloot NFTs only make up ~1.44% of all unique RMRK NFT holders.“This was admittedly a wrong stat. What I had in mind is a statistic we tweeted about a few weeks ago: \\[twitter post\\](https://twitter.com/EVRL00T/status/1578715277940097024/photo/1 ) Where we were minting close to 90% of all NFTs. But thats obviously just a 7D capture and not all time. Maybe I should have focused more on the utility we are offering, total minted NFTs is a stupid stat to go for anywhere, anybody can do that with minimal experience in javascript and enough KSM. What matters is what your NFT can do, which is our strong suit. Sorry for that. Now lets get to the provable wrong statements of yours. „Claim: Active userbase of 120 users Truth: Since block #15,000,000, 67 wallets were responsible for 90% of all non-team Evrloot SEND interactions“ I love that you took the time to analyze this and even printed out the list of all users that sent evrloot NFTs, because its even more than I thought. So we had 196 non-evrloot-wallet senders since block #15000000 . Every game EVER has a small amount of players put in the most amount of time and effort and the rest of the playerbase gradually investing less and less time compared to those. Obviously it wont be any different for us. Lets say 60% of those wallets, that sent evrloot NFTs, are actually players (why would they not, they can use their NFTs and get more for basically free by playing our game -> UTILITY), thats pretty much exactly 120 players. What I based my number on is unique wallets starting missions through our frontend on a daily basis. I am pretty sure most game studios go with users per month on this important stat, but we went with unique active DAILY wallets. And now we even have the blockchain data to prove it. „Claim: Users with 10 souls spend $22 per day Truth: There are only 4 wallets spending this much per day with a high cost estimate per SEND interaction and absolutely no wallets spending this much with low cost estimate per SEND interaction„ There is a fundamental aspect wrong here (READ THE PROPOSAL): I never said a player with 10 souls is spending 22$ per day. It says „If the players were to cover“! We are paying for all Minting fees related to our games, plus sending back the souls of the players back after the mission finished. Thats why we had to stop the game, we couldnt pay for these fees anymore. This is not about the send remarks players are creating. But since you did the calculation: Its insane that 4 wallets are already paying over 22$ per day ONLY for sending. This is about covering the minting costs and send remarks that are created on our side! A send remark is one of the cheapest remarks you can create on Kusama because of its relatively small size. What we are doing is minting NFTs for them based on the results of a mission. Minting one of our Fish for example (our most popular collection) takes not only 2 completely separate extrinsics, because of the way remark minting works, but its also approx. 14 times its size -> MINT (almost the same as send) - 3 RESADDS (one resource for a nice thumb on singular, one for our game, one to be equippable -> every single one being 4 times the size of a send) - SEND of the NFT to the player. Minting a fish costs us around 20 cents. And we dont have NFTs with 60 resources, like the abomination of NFTs you created, Adam. „Claim: Users think these fees are too expensive and are unwilling to pay them Truth: Current holders of Evrloot NFTs have endured a total net loss of 958 KSM on Evrloot NFTs so far. Clearly, users have no issue spending KSM on Evrloot. You also hosted a poll in your discord which does not verify Evrloot NFT ownership, so we have no way of knowing if your poll is actually the will of Evrloot NFT holders.“ What is this statistic supposed to mean? We had an initial sale volume of around 3k KSM in total from our very first collection, the Book of Lore and our Souls. So per your definition that would be a 3k KSM total net loss for Evrloot players? Following this definition, players actually were able to recuperate over 2k KSM by new players joining in and them being willing to pay rising floor prices because the demand rose and the utility we offer. If this is your actual definition and viewpoint I actually find it really sad how you view this whole space. While paying for a dinoxdino egg was, in my opinion, quite the net loss, I dont think purchasing a soul of ours is. You actually get something. You get utility, an ingame on chain marketplace, a merchant that offers trades to you on a daily basis, new content at least once a month. You dont get empty promises and month of not hearing anything. For the discord poll: Nice try in getting us to use your rmrk dao site again, but no thanks :) Regarding Moonbeam and your opinion of them needing to help us cover this difficult period: The amount of support and help from a technical, business and personal perspective from their Moonbeam council and Derek himself, is already a multitude higher than anything we experienced here. Addressing Paradox, because I want to comment on two of his/her concerns: Hi Paradox, „The proposal is not well presented and on the surface it just seems to be adapted to gain the maximum allowance of the track. Dare I say that Adam presented a better counter with his responses.“ Not sure what you mean with Adams counter. Having the Moonbeam foundation cover? They will say the exact same thing Adam is saying right now: „The game is not on our chain and neither is the current gameplay“. Where we are though, is Kusama. We are not milking Kusama for anything. We want to provide something for the users of the chain and thats the chain we are asking to cover those expenses. „I agree with the position that the relay-chain should not be conflicted with non-essential activities, likes games. It is primarily designed for chain security and fees should be adapted in adherence to this principle.“ While I understand this position I hope you can understand ours as well. We loved RMRK and what they were building and wanted to create something ourselves. While their advancements to EVMs and Pallets and thus Polkadot are finally happening, back in March, Kusama was the only way to start building with RMRK. We were RMRK first from the beginning and still are, so this limitation effectively hindered us at starting this anywhere else. We could have obviously waited a year more for the dependencies to be ready, but thats not how we operate and thats never going to be how we operate. We want to build cool stuff, do it as fast and good as possible. If that means Kusama, we will be on Kusama, if that means Moonbeam, we will be on Moonbeam. We would much rather deliver something at 80% perfection and create cool experiences for everyone involved, than to crawl towards the unachievable 100% and waste precious time and resources. „Should the relay-chain treasury pay for a project that adopted a poor business model? I think this proposal is best suited for the destination SC chain in this case Moonbeam.“ This was never really about the business model. While we do have multiple approaches to earn revenue from cosmetics, the marketplace, potential new souls when the playerbase grows, we first need to focus on delivering a pleasant experience. Selling eggs and letting buyers wait for a year before anything happens is horrible in my opinion, but is the business model of 90% of other collections in this space. Regarding Moonbeam -> I addressed this earlier.",
