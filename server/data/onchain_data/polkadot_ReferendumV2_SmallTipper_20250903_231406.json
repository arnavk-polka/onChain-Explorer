      "title": "Compensation Request for Polkadot Representation at Rare EVO",
      "content": "Hey, everyone!\n\nAs most of you likely saw on the timeline from August 8th and 9th, I was asked to help represent the Polkadot ecosystem at [Rare EVO](https://rareevo.io). Although the event organizers provided airfare and lodging at Caesar's Palace where the event took place, it did not cover other costs incurred such as Uber's to and from the airport, meals while on site (only dinners, as I tried to eat the provided breakfast and drank protein shakes at lunch), nor pay for my valuable time.\n\nI was at the booth both days for the majority of the time (9:30 - 4:30) with only occasional breaks. During my time there, I had many incredible conversations with curious folks who wanted to know what's been happening in the Polkadot ecosystem (shout-out to Charley from Mythical Games who was doing a great job showcasing FIFA Rivals and Pudgy Party), and walked away with a few leads for business and collaboration with the broader Cardano ecosystem.\n\nMuch like my previous treasury request for my time spent at the University of Miami's 3rd Annual Business of Blockchain Conference, I am asking for $100 per hour (less than what I charge via my single member LLC business, **blockACE**) for the 14 hours spent at the booth, with the remaining dollars to pay for Uber rides and meals (Vegas is CRAZY expensive).\n\nHere's some of the content I made while there:\n\n[Day One \"Stop By!\" Invite](https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1953926469316694039)\n[Day Two Video / Day One Recap](https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1954215549237690636)\n[Jay Interviewing Cam from Mythical Games](https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1954306871017472026)\n\nFeel free to ask any questions below!\n\nGratefully,\n\nPhunky",

      "content": "**Context**\n\n* In [<u>Referendum #748</u>](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/748) the Treasury loaned **50 000 DOT** to Pendulum so the Spacewalk bridge could post 200 % collateral for Stellar ↔ Polkadot transfers.\n\n\n* Since then the bridge has gone live and SatoshiPay released **Vortex**, a fiat off-ramp that lets users swap Stellar-based stablecoins into **EUR, ARS** and **BRL** (via Moonbeam for EVM chains). Vortex has now cleared **more than US $1.5 million** in transactions across Europe and Brazil.\n\n\n* To cut collateral costs and improve efficiency, an **alternative BRL corridor** has already been enabled by routing transfers through the Polkadot-native **BRLA.digital** stablecoin on Moonbeam.&#x20;\n\n\n* **Work under way** on further collateral-free paths across networks\n\n\n\n**Ask**\n\nWe propose a **symbolic Treasury motion with a 1 DOT transfer to the Treasury** that signals an extension of the existing 50 000 DOT loan by **six months (to 31 Jan 2026)**. Repaying now and re-requesting later would force a temporary scale-down of bridge capacity and interrupt EUR/ARS fiat ramps.\n\n* The DOT stays in the same multisig and remains **staked** as vDOT during the extension.\n\n\n* We want to extend the loan duration by six months so that we can keep the current paths via Spacewalk operational, while we are establishing other collateral-free routes for Vortex. Principal will be returned once collateral-free routes fully replace the original Stellar vaults.\n\n\n\nPlease **vote Aye** if you support keeping the loan active so the bridge and Vortex off-ramp can continue to operate without disruption while alternative routes are finalised.",

No changes have been made to the proposal content, and I encourage anyone reviewing this new submission to reference the detailed comments and responses already provided on 1678.\n\nGiven the high volume of OpenGov proposals - many requesting significantly larger amounts - and the limited 7-day window of the Small Tipper track, I believe some Decentralized Voices (DVs) did not have sufficient time to fully review the proposal. Additionally, due to the timing of 1678’s submission, I was unable to appear on Attempts At Governance (AAG) prior to the close of the decision period.\n\nFollowing [my appearance on AAG today](https://www.youtube.com/live/7scRQGCNE8k?si=MAoOfA1lrMl1SYLd&t=363) (July 24, 2025), I hope that:\n\n- **KusDAO** and **Hungarian DAO** will continue their support, as on 1678  \n- **Trustless Core** and **JAM Implementers DAO** will have time to review and vote  \n- **PermanenceDAO** and **PolkaWorld** will reconsider their original *NAY* votes  \n  - *PolkaWorld*: I’ve responded to your latest questions in the _DV Delegates – PolkaWorld Open Group_ Telegram group \n  - *PermanenceDAO*: I attempted to book an Office Hours slot, but none were available before August 6. I'm happy to address any questions here or in your _Permanence DAO - Public_ Telegram group\n\nFor **non-DV communities**, including **ChaosDAO**, I remain fully available to answer any questions or concerns.  \n\nThank you all for your time, attention, and continued engagement.\n",

      "content": "![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1101648855021400207/1395154382215053446/Levan_logo.png?ex=68796a45&is=687818c5&hm=a204bfbf23cc8240b34a015c872a1341ef3b57e3ef0723ee00a4ccf8cab66aab&)\n\nThe original six-month membership with the **Alan B. Levan | NSU Broward Center of Innovation** was approved via [Referendum #1224](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1224), and this proposal seeks to extend that membership for an additional six months, covering the period from **May through October 2025**. Looking ahead, I anticipate submitting a request for an **annual membership beginning in November 2025** to reduce the frequency of returning to OpenGov for renewal.\n\nThe **terms and benefits remain unchanged**, and I encourage reviewers to consult the original proposal for further background. The Levan Center continues to provide a l**ow-cost, low-risk opportunity to assess the long-term viability** of this strategic location. Based on the feedback and documentation shared via OG Tracker and in the comments of Referendum #1224, the initial six-month period has delivered measurable value.\n\nIn an effort to **enhance cost-effective, localized outreach for Polkadot**, I plan to adopt several proven community engagement strategies modeled after successful implementations in Toronto and other Roots cities. This includes launching **co-working sessions and WUD meet-ups** within the Levan facilities, in accordance with their membership terms and conditions. I intend to leverage **Levan’s complimentary conference rooms**, acknowledging their limited capacity. Should interest outgrow the available space, I am open to covering additional costs via relevant bounties to reserve larger rooms on-site for formal events.\n\nI acknowledge this proposal was submitted later than intended. I only recently realized that I have continued to pay the monthly membership fees beyond the approved period (November 2024 – April 2025) using my **personal credit card**. As confirmed in discussions with NSU’s Business Administrator during the original proposal period, **NSU does not accept cryptocurrency** as a form of payment. Therefore, consistent with the original arrangement, I have submitted this renewal proposal **under my personal Polkadot account**, and will continue to remit payments to the Levan Center **on behalf of the Polkadot ecosystem**.\n\nPlease note that membership fees for May, June, and July 2025 have already been paid. Copies of the relevant invoices can be found here:\n📎 Google Drive – [Invoices & Receipts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FLMh6WGBcu63jTOKZoiI8hNyHr99Lxt5?usp=sharing)\n\nIt’s worth noting that the Center is currently in a **leadership transition** and is actively searching for a new Executive Director. Until this position is filled, the implementation of several Polkadot-related initiatives I’ve proposed has been temporarily paused. Nonetheless, the Levan Center has proven to be an **effective environment for networking, raising awareness, and generating interest** in Polkadot.\n\nWe’ve also leveraged our broader regional network to **invite members of the Levan executive team and leadership from other prominent Levan-affiliated organizations** to join us in the **Polkadot VIP Suite at Inter Miami matches**. These gatherings are designed to foster both casual and meaningful conversations with local business and tech leaders in a relaxed setting.\n\nAs always, I extend an **open invitation to any ecosystem member** visiting South Florida to tour the Levan facilities or collaborate on hosting an event there.\n",

organized the monthly Polkadot Miami meetup, aligning with the conference, facilitated the Miami Freedom Park (MFP) tour, and provided exceptional hospitality at Inter Miami games and Bellillo dinner, engaging UM faculty (e.g., Dean Paul Pavlou, Professor Ola Henfridsson) and industry figures (e.g., Mike Spagnola, VISA), attended the pre conference tour as well as 2 day conference.\n\n## **Achievements**\n\n* Organized the Polkadot Miami meetup with James Slusser, dedicating significant hours to enhance local community engagement as they do monthly.  \n* Co-facilitated the MFP tour, advancing discussions on a potential U.S. presence for Polkadot and future partnerships.  \n* Hosted high-profile guests at Inter Miami games (May 28, 31), including UM faculty and industry leaders as well as VISA, Plug and Play, and others boosting Polkadot’s visibility.  \n* Managed Bellillo dinner for the conference, fostering key relationships with board members at the University.\n\n## **Time Commitment**\n\nSal’s time commitment over the event period:\n\n* **Pre-Event Planning (10 hours)**: Coordinated meetup logistics, MFP tour arrangements, and Inter Miami game hospitality planning.  \n* **Event Days (May 27-31, 25 hours)**: Hosted meetup (4 hours), co-facilitated MFP tour (4 hours), managed Bellillo dinner (2 hours), and hosted guests at Inter Miami games (6 hours), attended tour and conference (Day1) at the University (totaling 13 hrs).\n\nThe only time being requested was for that of time spent directly interfacing with University of Miami staff or conference attendees and kindly ask the community to consider $1500 of compensation (less than hours put in)\n\n**Sources**\n\n* *X Posts*:  \n  * @LearnPolkadot, Campus Tour:

I am requesting reimbursement for this expenditure. I have noted when the various accounts will stop being paid from my personal account and will work with the Fellowship to find another way to continue the tooling.\n\nIn the absence of an optimistic payment mechanism, I am forced to come to OpenGov for these expenses. There will follow a second proposal for compensation for the work done. This will signal the end of that phase.\n\nThank you for bearing with this process.",

Here's where I spoke on a panel about tokenization (still can't upload pics):\n\n[https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1928563407977881687](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/url)\n\nUPDATE: [Video of me discussing W3F's role in helping educate the SEC about Polkadot](https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1933894727390142700 \"Video of me discussing W3F's role in helping educate the SEC about Polkadot\")\n\nWhile I am grateful to the Events Bounty for covering my flight and my hotel costs, I have not been compensated for my time or other costs that were incurred by representing Polkadot (e.g. Uber rides to and from the airport). Moreover, considering this was not previously negotiated with the EB and they do not pay retroactively, I am hoping the community will agree that my time is valuable and that I worthy of compensation as an ad hoc / de facto part-time Polkadot Ambassador.\n\nIn my part time role with Ardent through my small business **blockACE**, I charge $100 per hour for my time. Although I spent well over 20 hours as a representative from our ecosystem, I am only asking to be paid for the time I directly interfaced with University of Miami staff or conference attendees. This included 5 hours during Thursday's campus tour, followed by a full 8 hour day for the first day of the conference, and a half day on Saturday.\n\nI respectfully request $1500 (Polkadot gets the friends and family discount) for my time.\n\nGratefully,\n\nRyan / Phunky\n\nAdditional coverage of the event:\n\nMid-campus tour:\n[https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1928114833662103952](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/url)\n\nVideo review at EOD:\n[https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1928164341141983337](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/url)\n\nVideo at the outset of Day 1:\n[https://x.com/ThePhunky1/status/1928436787682136281](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/url)",

      "content": "During the first funded phase of the Ambassador Fellowship, we achieved remarkable success — even amidst periods of uncertainty and transition. This success was largely thanks to the dedication of individuals who stepped up as volunteers to ensure we not only met but exceeded our deliverables within the agreed timeframe.\n\nPer the agreement with the Advisory Board (see[ <u>Sprint Overview Document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zc0WAzXezZSFryfZ-xlpLPt4xgouvl4mLamy60fO15k/edit?usp=drive_link)), a discretionary payment was to be made to the core team upon successful delivery by May 3, 2025. Through careful financial stewardship — managed solely by myself — $230,000 remained in the Ambassador Fellowship fund. The plan was to distribute $29,000 to the team, with the remaining $201,000 returned to the treasury when the Board stepped down (five weeks later than anticipated).\n\nThe delivery deadline was met, and the Advisory Board confirmed the work was completed successfully.\n\nHowever, during this period, several Board members resigned due to the extended duration of their roles. With diminished capacity and activity, decision-making became increasingly difficult. Ultimately, the remaining funds — including the portion intended for the team — were returned in full to the treasury for administrative ease. As a result, the promised payments were not made.\n\nToday, the Ambassador Fellowship remains active and is preparing a proposal for further funding to support its continued growth. Cohort Two is currently being seeded, and a waitlist for Cohort Three is already forming — a clear sign of the program's community value and continued success. You can find our[ <u>Delivery Report here</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WwkjxAzOe5SIbSICl5vcQ2ziAtnUCwe/view?usp=drive_link).\n\nAfter careful consideration and consultation, I believe the fairest path forward is to submit individual compensation requests on behalf of each team member. These individuals fulfilled their commitments and contributed significantly to the Fellowship’s outcomes. The full list of team members and corresponding payment amounts can be found in this[ <u>Spreadsheet</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16J8qxv9-Z0ky35yRFn-OlkuxoRZt5s7XO75kwtsFSoQ/edit?gid=755697593#gid=755697593).\n\nThank you for your continued support of the team, the principle of fairness within the ecosystem, and the enduring impact of the Ambassador Fellowship.",

      "content": "During the first funded phase of the Ambassador Fellowship, we achieved remarkable success — even amidst periods of uncertainty and transition. This success was largely thanks to the dedication of individuals who stepped up as volunteers to ensure we not only met but exceeded our deliverables within the agreed timeframe.\n\nPer the agreement with the Advisory Board (see[ <u>Sprint Overview Document</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zc0WAzXezZSFryfZ-xlpLPt4xgouvl4mLamy60fO15k/edit?usp=drive_link)), a discretionary payment was to be made to the core team upon successful delivery by May 3, 2025. Through careful financial stewardship — managed solely by myself — $230,000 remained in the Ambassador Fellowship fund. The plan was to distribute $29,000 to the team, with the remaining $201,000 returned to the treasury when the Board stepped down (five weeks later than anticipated).\n\nThe delivery deadline was met, and the Advisory Board confirmed the work was completed successfully.\n\nHowever, during this period, several Board members resigned due to the extended duration of their roles. With diminished capacity and activity, decision-making became increasingly difficult. Ultimately, the remaining funds — including the portion intended for the team — were returned in full to the treasury for administrative ease. As a result, the promised payments were not made.\n\nToday, the Ambassador Fellowship remains active and is preparing a proposal for further funding to support its continued growth. Cohort Two is currently being seeded, and a waitlist for Cohort Three is already forming — a clear sign of the program's community value and continued success. You can find our[ <u>Delivery Report here</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18WwkjxAzOe5SIbSICl5vcQ2ziAtnUCwe/view?usp=drive_link).\n\nAfter careful consideration and consultation, I believe the fairest path forward is to submit individual compensation requests on behalf of each team member. These individuals fulfilled their commitments and contributed significantly to the Fellowship’s outcomes. The full list of team members and corresponding payment amounts can be found in this[ <u>Spreadsheet</u>](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16J8qxv9-Z0ky35yRFn-OlkuxoRZt5s7XO75kwtsFSoQ/edit?gid=755697593#gid=755697593).\n\nThank you for your continued support of the team, the principle of fairness within the ecosystem, and the enduring impact of the Ambassador Fellowship.",

      "title": "VOTE NAY - Wrong category- [Retroactive Funding] JAM SDK Implementation of reusable service",
      "content": "Hello people, i want to introduce my project “**JAM Whitelist Role Authorizer**”, an implementation that **uses the JAM SDK** to provide a role-based and whitelist authorization system. This project is a significant contribution to the Polkadot open source ecosystem and demonstrates the potential of the JAM SDK to develop practical and scalable solutions.\n\n**What does this project do?**  \nThe JAM Whitelist Role Authorizer allows managing authorized addresses, assigning roles (administrator, participant, observer), and running an interactive game where participants answer questions under supervision. The system ensures that only authorized addresses can perform specific actions, ensuring transparency and security in decentralized environments.\n\nAdditionally, **the repository’s resources are available in both English🇬🇧 and Spanish 🇪🇸**, making it easy to use and understand for a global developers.  \n  \n\nOpen Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/Themvp07/JAM-Playground-SDK/tree/main)\n\n**JAM SDK Components Used**\n\n1.  **jam-types (Implemented) Description**: This crate contains basic types and structures needed for working with services and authorizers in JAM.  \n    **Components Used**:  \n    **Authorizer**: Represents the JAM system's authorizer. It contains two main fields:  \n    **code\\_hash**: A hash representing the program code.  \n    **param**: A parameter that can store additional information (e.g., the admin's address). **CodeHash**: Represents a 32-byte hash used to validate whether a hash belongs to a list of valid hashes.  \n    **AuthParam**: A parameter used to store additional data related to authorization.  \n    **Usage in the Project**:  \n    Authorizer is used to manage the validation of authorized addresses.  \n    A CodeHash is dynamically generated based on the admin's name and used to verify the authenticity of operations.  \n    AuthParam is extended with the admin's address to track who performed certain actions.\n2.  **jam-pvm-common (Reviewed for Future Implementation) Description**: Provides common functionalities for working with the PVM (Parity Virtual Machine).  \n    **Current Usage**: Not explicitly used in the current code.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used to ensure that data generated by the authorizer is compatible with the PVM runtime environment. For example, you could implement specific serialization/deserialization functions to handle data in the format required by the PVM.\n3.  **jam-bootstrap-service (Reviewed, Used as Reference) Description**: A basic service useful for creating initial configurations (genesis) in JAM.  \n    **Usage in the Project**: Cloned as a reference to understand how to configure a basic service in JAM.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used to define an initial configuration that includes predefined addresses for the admin, participant, and observer.\n4.  **jam-null-authorizer (Used as a Starting Point, but Not Present in the Current Code) Description**: A basic authorizer that allows testing without authorization restrictions.  \n    **Current Usage**: Not explicitly used in the current code.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used as a starting point to implement more advanced test cases. For example, it could be integrated to test scenarios where no authorization is required.\n5.  **jam-pvm-build (Reviewed but Not Publicly Available) Description**: A CLI tool that allows building PVM code blobs for services or authorizers.  \n    **Current Usage**: Not explicitly used in the current code.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used to compile the custom authorizer into a deployable PVM blob.\n\n**Community Value**\n\nThis project not only demonstrates how to effectively integrate and use the JAM SDK, but also serves as a practical example for other developers wishing to build similar services. It also:\n\n-   Encourages adoption of the JAM SDK by providing a real,easily adaptable use case for other functional services.\n-   Provides a modular and extensible solution that can adapt to various authorization scenarios in decentralized applications.\n-   Guidance documentation available in multiple languages.\n\n**Execution worlflow**\n\n1.

          "content": "Hello people, i want to introduce my project “**JAM Whitelist Role Authorizer**”, an implementation that **uses the JAM SDK** to provide a role-based and whitelist authorization system. This project is a significant contribution to the Polkadot open source ecosystem and demonstrates the potential of the JAM SDK to develop practical and scalable solutions.\n\n**What does this project do?**  \nThe JAM Whitelist Role Authorizer allows managing authorized addresses, assigning roles (administrator, participant, observer), and running an interactive game where participants answer questions under supervision. The system ensures that only authorized addresses can perform specific actions, ensuring transparency and security in decentralized environments.\n\nAdditionally, **the repository’s resources are available in both English🇬🇧 and Spanish 🇪🇸**, making it easy to use and understand for a global developers.  \n  \n\nOpen Source Code: [Github](https://github.com/Themvp07/JAM-Playground-SDK/tree/main)\n\n**JAM SDK Components Used**\n\n1.  **jam-types (Implemented) Description**: This crate contains basic types and structures needed for working with services and authorizers in JAM.  \n    **Components Used**:  \n    **Authorizer**: Represents the JAM system's authorizer. It contains two main fields:  \n    **code\\_hash**: A hash representing the program code.  \n    **param**: A parameter that can store additional information (e.g., the admin's address). **CodeHash**: Represents a 32-byte hash used to validate whether a hash belongs to a list of valid hashes.  \n    **AuthParam**: A parameter used to store additional data related to authorization.  \n    **Usage in the Project**:  \n    Authorizer is used to manage the validation of authorized addresses.  \n    A CodeHash is dynamically generated based on the admin's name and used to verify the authenticity of operations.  \n    AuthParam is extended with the admin's address to track who performed certain actions.\n2.  **jam-pvm-common (Reviewed for Future Implementation) Description**: Provides common functionalities for working with the PVM (Parity Virtual Machine).  \n    **Current Usage**: Not explicitly used in the current code.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used to ensure that data generated by the authorizer is compatible with the PVM runtime environment. For example, you could implement specific serialization/deserialization functions to handle data in the format required by the PVM.\n3.  **jam-bootstrap-service (Reviewed, Used as Reference) Description**: A basic service useful for creating initial configurations (genesis) in JAM.  \n    **Usage in the Project**: Cloned as a reference to understand how to configure a basic service in JAM.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used to define an initial configuration that includes predefined addresses for the admin, participant, and observer.\n4.  **jam-null-authorizer (Used as a Starting Point, but Not Present in the Current Code) Description**: A basic authorizer that allows testing without authorization restrictions.  \n    **Current Usage**: Not explicitly used in the current code.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used as a starting point to implement more advanced test cases. For example, it could be integrated to test scenarios where no authorization is required.\n5.  **jam-pvm-build (Reviewed but Not Publicly Available) Description**: A CLI tool that allows building PVM code blobs for services or authorizers.  \n    **Current Usage**: Not explicitly used in the current code.  \n    **Future Suggestion**: It could be used to compile the custom authorizer into a deployable PVM blob.\n\n**Community Value**\n\nThis project not only demonstrates how to effectively integrate and use the JAM SDK, but also serves as a practical example for other developers wishing to build similar services. It also:\n\n-   Encourages adoption of the JAM SDK by providing a real,easily adaptable use case for other functional services.\n-   Provides a modular and extensible solution that can adapt to various authorization scenarios in decentralized applications.\n-   Guidance documentation available in multiple languages.\n\n**Execution worlflow**\n\n1.

These were the reasons for holding 2 days of workshops there.\n\nFor 2 days (3 hours per day) a workshop was provided for developers where they were able to explore various resources available in the Polkadot ecosystem by completing theoretical and practical exercises.\n\nActivity agenda:\n\n**Day 1**\n\nThe workshop started with a basic introduction to cryptography. This covered:\n\n• Hash functions\n\n• Elliptic curves\n\nWe then moved on to a basic introduction to blockchains, covering:\n\n• Blockchain evolution (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot)\n\n• Decentralized application architecture\n\n• Smart contracts explained\n\n• Key concepts in Rust.\n\n**Workshop**: Participants will be able to create interactive logic using Rust.\n\n**Day 2**\n\nOn the second day, we focused on the Polkadot ecosystem and built fully functional blockchains using the Polkadot SDK:\n\n• Introduction to Polkadot and its architecture.\n\n• Solutions available in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\n• Importance of XCM interoperability between chains.\n\n**Workshop**: We learned and successfully completed a implementation about Substrate, the blockchain development framework provided by the Polkadot SDK.\n\nThis was the first time that this type of blockchain activities was carried out in Arequipa and **obtaining great results** among which the following can be mentioned:\n\n-   Massive participation during the activities.\n-   Inclusion of participants in official channels of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nReference: [https://x.com/polkadot\\_per/status/1761799081591017946?s=52&t=xZwu9y0l8ACyMwWB7pH3Rg](https://x.com/polkadot_per/status/1761799081591017946?s=52&t=xZwu9y0l8ACyMwWB7pH3Rg)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/q1Kz7wQ/1.png)\n\nIt was possible to get interactions on Polkadot official Discord\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Fz6Yx7W/2.png)\n\n• Additionally in June a hackathon was held in Lima, Peru where 2 teams made up of Arequipeños **received scholarships from Polkadot Peru to travel to Lima and achieved first and third place** in the smart contracts category with Rust, demonstrating the talent present in the region.\n\nReferences:\n\nFirst place repository: [https://github.com/Space4Build/La-Causathon-Chaintrust](https://github.com/Space4Build/La-Causathon-Chaintrust)\n\nPost: [https://x.com/Polkadot\\_per/status/1805601736897319361](https://x.com/Polkadot_per/status/1805601736897319361)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/x7vd1zs/eq1.jpg)\n\nThird place repository: [https://github.com/Space4Build/La-Causathon-CLAMZ/tree/main](https://github.com/Space4Build/La-Causathon-CLAMZ/tree/main)\n\nPost: [https://x.com/Polkadot\\_per/status/1805601754156777526](https://x.com/Polkadot_per/status/1805601754156777526)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/VNwwhRX/eq2.jpg)",

      "content": "Dear Polkadot Frens:  \n  \nAs many are aware, my good friends at _Modern Market_, BCheque and Legendary, have been tapped [to showcase parts of the Polkadot ecosystem](https://x.com/BCheque1/status/1876357466528550938) in a limited sponsorship via the Marketing Bounty.   \n  \nMany of you may also recall my attempt to lock them up for a 6 month headline sponsorship during the window of time when the old MB was defunct and the new one hadn't been set up ([Ref. 1085](referenda/1085)). Since that point in October, the show has seen an explosion in growth, partly fueled by my friend and frequent contributor s4mmy.eth's relentless focus and research on the AI agent niche within the broader crypto market.  \n  \nI am undoubtely happy for both the _Modern Market_ crew as well as the ecosystem to get some exposure through their show. I have told them I will help bring anyone from Polkadot to their Founder Friday interviews and otherwise remain a resource for them due to my daily appearance on the show as a regular panelist and occasional guest co-host duties.  \n  \nHaving said that, and based on my past experience as a recruiter before joining Lucky Friday / Web3 full time ~ 2.5 years ago, I believe I deserve a small finder's fee for highlighing this talented team and introducing them to the ecosystem. The Marketing Bounty curators even went so far as to tell me that because of my introduction it made the vetting easy and they green lit them through the new agency that brought them (and others) to the MB.  \n  \nHowever, in the recruiting world, this is a massive no-no. If \"candidates\" are presented by other agencies (or individual recruiters), it is incumbent upon the client to return to the original recruiter to continue conversations with the candidate. Granted, I do not expect the curators to know or do this, but it definitely bothered me that I was cut out of the loop in this process and only informed after the fact. At the time of the original deal, I was only asking for a 5% (very, very low) commision, half of which I was willing to donate via Teddy DAO to a charity of the MM crew's collective choice.  \n  \nI am asking for a small tip to help rectify this situation, which is just over 10% of my original cut (had to go with the meme number). I believe this is more than resonable considering the circumstances, but happy to hear from others as to why this isn't deserved.  \n  \nThank you in advance for your support!  \n  \nGratefully,  \n  \nRyan / Phunky",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I would like to propose a Tip in OpenGov for the continuous work I have done to make information about Bounties on Polkadot more accessible and transparent for the entire community. The evolution of this effort has been documented and discussed in the community forum (you can see the details [here](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/necessary-improvements-in-transparency-and-bounty-tracking-in-opengov/9419)).\n\n**Contribution Breakdown Creation and Maintenance of Tools:** I have developed a dashboard on [Dune](https://dune.com/lily_mendz/bounties) that provides an easy and visual way to track data related to Bounties. Additionally, I have designed a [landing page](https://dotbountieshub.online/) and started managing a profile on X  to share updates and news more efficiently. This profile will serve as an evolution of the PDF where I initially compiled information about Bounties.\n\n**Reasons for Requesting This Tip Through OpenGov**  \nI decided to submit this request through OpenGov because I believe it is the most suitable channel to reward contributions that have a broad impact on the ecosystem. While some may think this work fits under the Marketing Bounty, the nature of my project goes beyond mere promotion. It is a continuous effort that combines development and transparency, both of which are crucial for the ecosystem's growth and health.\n\nOpenGov offers a more inclusive and suitable framework for evaluating these multidimensional contributions and ensures that treasury funds are used efficiently for the benefit of the entire community.  \n  \n\nThe main motivation is to make this information easy to find, especially for newcomers to the ecosystem who are looking to learn about Bounties or propose one, ensuring they don’t end up duplicating existing ideas.\n\nRequested Amount: 1250 USDT\n\nThank you for your consideration, and I look forward to your comments and suggestions.",

      "content": "![](https://i.ibb.co/52c2kCd/levan-center-logo.png)\n\n**Proponent**: 14QhzKsxmrECK8EDpLzzep8tWcYMUPYfXGfmgqM8cVtYRJjJ (James Slusser)\n\nTBD (Levan Center of Innovation account)\n\n_Note: 10-09-24 Per a conversation with the NSU Business Administrator, they do not accept crypto as a form of payment for any services at NSU. The only forms of payment they can offer are, credit card through the marketplace site, check, ACH or wire transfer (these are as a last resort option). Therefore, I have changed the Proponent from the Levan Center of Innovation to my personal Polkadot account, and will remit to Levan on behalf of Polkadot._\n\n**Date**: September 30, 2024\n\n**Requested USDT**: 2,400 USDT\n\n**Summary**: This proposal requests 2,400 USDT to sponsor Polkadot’s 6-month membership to the [Alan B. Levan | NSU Broward Center of Innovation](https://www.nova.edu/innovation/)  at the Reserved Desk level, providing Polkadot with access to a physical space in South Florida for Business Development meetings, MeetUps and Networking with other member organizations. This is a low-cost, low-risk method to test the location’s viability, and if proven effective, can be upgraded to a private office or Corporate-sponsored space pending availability.  The linked draft proposal details all membership benefits.\n\nThe Alan B. Levan | NSU Broward Center of Innovation is a public-private partnership between [Nova Southeastern University](https://www.nova.edu/) and [Broward County](https://www.broward.org/Pages/Welcome.aspx) acting as an economic and education development engine linking the South Florida innovation ecosystem.  They partner with public and private entities across various industries for a local, regional, national, and international impact.\n\nThe sponsorship aims to begin the process of establishing a physical presence to leverage connections with businesses, educational institutions, government officials, blockchain policy advocates and the community at large to drive awareness, foster growth, and explore new integrations. Additionally it will serve as one location to host Polkadot-branded monthly MeetUps, Hackathons and other educational initiatives.\n\nThis proposal will leverage the **leadership** of Angela Dalton, North America Head Ambassador, expand upon the **learnings** from Ecosystem Agent The Weak Hand (Sal Esposito) and his core-team role managing the Inter Miami deal, and support Ecosystem Agent James Slusser to **grow Polkadot’s presence in Florida**.\n\nFlorida currently has the third-largest population in the United States, with an estimated 22.95 million people in 2024. Its economy is the fourth largest in the country, boasting a real GDP of $1.6 trillion as of the third quarter of 2023. In terms of global economic standings, Florida ranks as the 13th largest economy in the world. In the third quarter of 2023, Florida's economy experienced a growth rate of 6.1%, significantly outpacing the overall U.S. economy. The state's economic contributions account for approximately 5.7% of the entire U.S. economy, highlighting its significant influence both nationally and globally​.\n\nFollowing OpenGov protocol I will leave the Pre-Proposal Discussion open for two weeks, followed by the referendum submission. I welcome and appreciate all community feedback, questions and comments, and will request to appear on AAG to discuss further.\n\nFor details, please see the [draft Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MSEpHPvmYbxtmqGJvewNsN57oiU8lG9Xb24-3tKSpZw/edit?usp=sharing)",

There was a crypto wendy post I made that got astronomical amount of people's attention on OpenGov. \n\n[https://x.com/theweb3patriot/status/1727096982295200110?s=46](https://x.com/theweb3patriot/status/1727096982295200110?s=46)\n\nThis post helped save the treasury $51,000 usd at the time.   \n  \nit also sparked conversation in regards to Influencers taking advantage of the Polkadot treasury and even got other ecosystem talking about the risk of influencers taking advantage.\n\nI am requesting a  tip of 500 $Dot  \n\nThat will be staked and and set at 6x conviction for voting under the delegate \"The Sons of Gavin\"",

          "content": "*Disclaimer*: This is not a funding / top-up proposal. The transfer of 1 DOT is a mere “stamp of approval” of the changes proposed below.\n\nPAL is a community-driven initiative that aims to make Polkadot a safer and more attractive place for both builders and users by allocating funds from the Polkadot treasury ([bounty #22](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/22)) to advance security in Rust / Polkadot SDK. \n\nSince its creation, PAL has distributed **157,155 DOT** to co-fund **14 Rust security audits** of **11 Polkadot parachains**, helping secure **18 High-risk vulnerabilities** that may have resulted in loss of user funds (see [PAL Community Report H1 24)](https://github.com/polkadot-assurance-legion/pal-docs/blob/main/community-reports/pal-24h1.md).\n\nThis proposal aims to bring PAL into the next stage of its evolution by expanding the scope beyond “audits of parachains” towards a more holistic approach to Polkadot security. The expertise of the curators should be leveraged to review and - where appropriate - renegotiate security initiatives which would otherwise go directly to OpenGov. At the same time, this proposal tightens the maximum payouts (previously up to 18,000 DOT) and denominates the thresholds in a stable currency (USD).\n\nList of proposed changes including high-level limitations and rationale:\n\n* **Beyond parachains: Open eligibility to coretime consumers (audits)**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum 80% of the costs or up to $100,000 per chain and per 6 months. The criteria will be further specified and published by the curators.\n\n*Rationale*: The original eligibility criteria are confined to the definition of a parachain. This should be adjusted as Polkadot transitions into coretime. At the same time, curators will need to ensure that coretime consumers applying for funding are serious and trustworthy actors. This will be achieved through a combination of objective criteria and subjective judgment.\n\n* **Open eligibility to Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot (audits)**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum 50% of the costs or up to $50,000 per project and per 6 months. The criteria will be further specified and published by the curators.\n\n*Rationale*: The adoption of ink! has been lagging behind, and with the birth of Plaza we expect that the share of Solidity smart contracts in Polkadot will grow. The curators will need to ensure that the smart contracts applying for funding are trustworthy and will be deployed on Polkadot, and not elsewhere.\n\n* **Open eligibility to Polkadot relay chain and system chains (audits)**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum 80% of the costs, up to $100,000 per chain and per 6 months.\nThe criteria will be further specified and published by the curators.\n\n*Rationale*: Covering (a part of) the audits of the Polkadot relay chain and its system chains will increase the transparency and control by the community, allowing us to identify critical parts of the common infrastructure that require (further) auditing.\n\n* **Open eligibility to common-good security tooling**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum $250,000. If the application exceeds $50,000, it must be split into milestones and subsequent payouts will only be done after the previous milestone has been delivered.\n\n*Rationale*: As OpenGov funding requests for security tooling increase (example [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/942)), it makes sense to channel such requests through the PAL bounty and leverage the expertise of the curators who are better suited to give a judgment on the added value of the tooling and its costs relative to other security initiatives.\n\n* **Open eligibility to other common-good security initiatives**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum $25,000 per use-case.\n\n*Rationale*: PAL Curators should have the discretion to spend limited resources towards common-good initiatives that do not fall in one of the categories mentioned above. For example, by making donations towards the reputable [SEAL](https://securityalliance.org/) cross-ecosystem initiative we could have a 911 hotline for victims dedicated to Polkadot, organize War Games (simulate attacks to train security response) or implement the Safe Harbour Agreement which provides guarantees to whitehats.\n\n* **Replace the curator fee (2%) with a monthly curator salary**\n\n*Limitations*: $3000 worth of DOT per curator per month.\n\n*Rationale*: The current fee mechanism has proven too limited to provide sufficient incentives for administering the bounty. For 8 months of work, each curator has received short of 500 DOT so far. To accommodate the current and future scope of work, this proposal converts the fee into a monthly salary ensuring that the curators will be incentivized to book at least one day per week to onboard security experts and thoroughly examine and renegotiate their applications.\n\n* **Add [Vincent Di Giambattista](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdigiambattista/) (Parity) as a PAL curator, replacing Dominik Harz**\n\nWith over 30 years of experience in the security field, Vince is currently the CISO at Parity leading the Security team to adapt the security posture of Parity and support to Polkadot in alignment with the evolution of the cyber threat landscape.\n\n* **Add Kirill Pimenov ([Kampela](https://www.kampe.la/)) as a PAL curator, replacing Hang Yin**\n\nHaving joined Parity in 2017 within a couple of weeks after the infamous “Ooops, I’ve accidentally killed it” hack, Kirill soon took charge of all things security at Parity, being Head of Security/CISO for almost 5 years. Currently Kirill runs his own hardware security startup, Kampela — and advises some other teams in the space on the topics of security and blockchain engineering in general.\n\n\n**Stay safu.**",

In short, free to use co-working space for all of us.\n\nA few of us are already working from this office as Polkadot Ambassadors thanks to Mosaic Chain and we agreed to open up this possibility for others as well.\n\nThis proposal is aiming to make the decision official by Polkadot, hence the amount requested is 1 DOT. The work to prepare the agreement started a few months ago and is part my work as a Head Ambassador, so no management is calculated.\n\nThe hub is running based on the rules specified by the [Polkadot Hubs playbook](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-hubs-physical-spaces-in-polkadot-playbook/5000).\n\nPlease **vote Aye! if you want to make the physical Polkadot Hub in Budapest, Hungary official**, run by the Polkadot Hungary community.\n\nPlease see the forum discussion for details:\n[https://forum.polkadot.network/t/the-next-polkadot-hub-budapest-astoria/8198](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/the-next-polkadot-hub-budapest-astoria/8198)",

      "title": "Less noise, more Polkadot",
      "content": "Hello dear community, For those who don't know me, I’m Albert, also known as I Love Cripto on social media. I’m 40 years old and have been a community member since 2020. The first time I watched a Polkadot video, I felt a deep connection and knew I had to be a part of it. Today, I’m still here and very happy with my decision in August 2020. Thanks to Polkadot, I have improved in many aspects of my life, and for that, I am and will be eternally grateful. The reason for this message is the increasing toxicity I've observed in the community. I’m concerned about the growing negative noise, and that’s why I decided to write this post. This might not be the most appropriate place for it, but I prefer to do it here rather than on the Polkadot Forum, where it could be censored, and certainly not on Twitter. I apologize if this offends anyone. It's painful to see how Twitter has become a battlefield where the Polkadot community attacks each other. This strategy brings nothing positive to Polkadot or its community. The only beneficiaries are those seeking likes, humorous comments, or those who directly wish harm upon Polkadot. If we add more fuel to the fire, we are heading in the wrong direction. This deeply hurts me, and I have been carrying this for a long time, which is why I decided to express it here today. Using Twitter to expose the community's airing dirty laundry is a bad strategy. I won't mention names, but if you feel alluded to, this message might be for you. With this attitude, you not only erode the reputation of the person you attack but also that of Polkadot as a whole. We are damaging our image, and no matter how much we spend on marketing or development, if we don't build a healthy community, everything else is pointless. We need to build the house from the ground up. So if you have a problem, tell the person involved. If you think someone is doing a bad job, show them that you can do it better. It's very easy to criticize, and creating takes much effort. If there's an illicit proposal, vote against it, and if it gets approved, wait to see what they do. If something goes wrong, conduct an audit and present it on the Polkadot Forum or the channels we have, not on Twitter. My maxim is: if you don't have something positive to say, don't say it. Be constructive, not destructive. Destroying is easy, creating is hard, especially when it comes to reputation. I can't imagine what other community members, investors, or even our competition think when they see how we destroy each other. If I were an investor or a company, I wouldn't want to build or invest in something with so much noise. In the end, no one wants to invest in a project full of daily dramas, or at least I wouldn't. This unnecessary stress and wear seriously damage Polkadot's reputation. So I ask myself: Is this the image we want to project? Don't we have better tools to solve our problems? Can we send a DM if we have an issue with someone? It saddens me to see this situation because my feelings for Polkadot are comparable only to my passion for my football team. If I had one wish, I would like to see a change in attitude within the community. If you see something illicit, contact the person directly and ask. We are all adults, and people understand each other by talking. There are two sides to every coin, and if you try to understand the other person, you’ll see that not everything is bad and their point of view is also valid. Posting on Twitter only spreads the problem instead of calming it. I can perfectly understand that someone may feel frustrated or disappointed with things that happen in Polkadot because it has happened to me, but the most important thing should be Polkadot, not our ego, anger, frustration, or personal benefit. If Polkadot prospers, we will attract more investors, companies, and developers. This will make the snow ball grow and grow, and we will all be happier and able to continue building and supporting the ecosystem. The growth will be exponential. Let's be aware of how our actions affect Polkadot. Let's make an analogy of what we are doing on Twitter: Imagine we all drink water from a lake, but someone defecates in it on the opposite shore. In the end, that person will also drink that water. Does it make sense? Wouldn't it be better to have an exclusive place for our needs without contaminating the water we drink? We all know the answer. Finally, I would like to see more support on Twitter for the technology and the positive aspects of Polkadot. If we redirected the energy we use to criticize towards building, we would be incredible. Polkadot has a great future, it is the best blockchain, with brilliant leaders and a talented community, so let's not put obstacles in our way or create unnecessary friction. There will always be bad actors, but the community and the system will remove them. In short, these are my words to help reduce toxicity in the ecosystem. If I had managed to change the mindset of a few people, it would have been worth it. P.S.: I’m not an example of anything, nor do I pretend to be. I only seek the common good for everyone, especially for Polkadot. Let everyone draw their conclusions and self-critique what they do, say, and think. Best regards, and have a great summer. I Love Cripto",

          "content": "Hey Polkadot fam! We are excited to propose the referendum for the curators of the UX Bounty.\n\n————————————————\n\nTL;DR: \nThe bounty will be managed with a 6/9 multisig, which is being created as we speak. We are missing 3 curators to join as they are on holiday. \n\nPure Proxy: 16YDgheHwtmQ9UsmiuZEeVgFzdGF8rnctoEj5NHVTsQonBwe\nMultisig: 1fK6bvwDhLFtJ2WyvrGGC8AX3N8X6AbZZSTkydg9WHxidMJ (will change)\n\n————————————————\n\nWe wanted to take the time to address the recent concerns about bounty management and explain our approach to mitigate conflict of interests.\n\n\n\n# 1. Measures to manage conflict of interest\nWe have debated for a long time about the curator/executor conflict of interest. One of the main points we need to be conscious of is that finding UX expertise is more challenging than finding marketing expertise. \n\n\nRemoving the capability for our curators to work on tasks would be counterproductive, as our set of curators holds a big part of the UX expertise in the ecosystem. \n\nTo address this, we’ll be following those measures: \n\n1. Curators who are also executing tasks will <u>**abstain from voting on their own proposals**.</u>\n2. Projects executed by curators will <u>**undergo higher scrutiny**</u>, ensuring rigorous evaluation and validation before approval. \n3. All votes and decisions will be <u>**documented and made publicly accessible**</u> to maintain transparency and build community trust.\n\n\n\n\n# 2. Multisig Structure \n\nWith the Bounty Operator role, we are proposing a new setup that hasn't been used before. Braille, in this role, will need to be part of the multisig to expedite the signing process. \n\nWithout this, we rely on the Curators to handle this task, which (a) isn’t in their scope, and (b) is a significant time commitment, as we've seen in multiple discussions regarding bounty management. \n\nBraille will act as an <u>**automatic approver for all transactions**</u>, which won’t impact the results of the curator voting, as it will be accounted for in the multisig threshold.\n\n\n# 3. Illustrations \nStructure with an Operator: \n\n- The multisig is composed of 8 Curators and 1 Operator (Braille). \n- To get approval, 5 out of 8 Curators must approve a spending. \n- This is what we call a 5/8 multisig. \n\n⇒ With the Operator included, **the multisig becomes 6/9**, as the Operator will always approve every transaction.\n\n—\n\nStructure when Curators are abstaining because they are also Executors: \n- When a curator proposes to be an executor, they abstain from voting and are removed from the multisig threshold. \n- The multisig **passes from a 6/9 to a 6/8**. \n- The Curator still needs 6 approvals but has fewer possibilities as their vote is removed. \n\n⇒ This change represents a 10% increase in difficulty.\n\n\n# 4. List of Proposed Curators \n\nA table recap of each expertise brought by the teams.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/7J7YFsZ/21498-Braille-1721820947127.png)\n\nBelow, the bio of every curator. \n\n## SubWallet (DJ) \nA summa cum laude graduate from Washington and Lee University, DJ Hà Trang now works as Research Lead at SubWallet and contributes to making SubWallet one of the leading wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem with over 1,000,000 active users on 3 platforms: browser extension, mobile app and web dashboard. She also co-founded Dotinsights where she wrote in-depth quarterly reports on the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nAt the forefront of user and partner support, DJ works closely with the product team to constantly exchange feedback and improve the user experience in SubWallet, which translates to better experience in the Polkadot ecosystem overall for new users. \n\n## Nova (Anton) \nAnton has been designing and building user-focused products for over 10 years and has been building for Polkadot since 2019. He holds a Master’s in Software Engineering and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science.\n\nAnton is working on the leading mobile app for Polkadot, Nova Wallet, as well as on Telenova, Polkadot Vault, and Nova Spektr.\n\nAnton's main focus is the success of Polkadot.\n\n## Talisman (Nobyte)\nNobyte is the head of product at Talisman, passionate about good user experiences, and has more than a decade of experience in software design, user research, product management, and engineering.\n\nTalisman Wallet has a track record of approaching product design in Polkadot from first principles, pushing a multi-chain portfolio abstraction that has led the standard for the ecosystem.\n\n## Apillon (Nino) \nNino sources from interdisciplinary expertise in academic UX research and extensive professional experience at IT powerhouses such as Microsoft, Telekom, Sailbrace, Iconomi (CPO), and Futourist (CTO) to develop and perfect the Apillon platform. Nino maintains a strong focus on user perspective and experience, as well as the technological capabilities and opportunities of the space. \n\n## Velocity Labs (Nico) \nNicolas Arevalo (Nico) is the co-founder and CEO of Velocity Labs. He’s been in the Polkadot ecosystem since 2020 when he joined Acala as its Director of BD where he was responsible for pushing Acala’s DeFi primitives to both internal Polkadot builders and external ones. End of 2022, he joined Parity as the DeFi Lead for the EcoDev team where he oversaw all DeFi BD initiatives both at the parachain level as well as support parachains teams at the dapp level. Nico also looked after infrastructure pieces like Oracles, Bridges, Stablecoins and others. \n\nNow as CEO of Velocity, he’ll be supporting the ecosystem with a more hands-on approach and by not only building, but helping builders build. Velocity is also the operator of the DeFi Infrastructure Bounty.\n\n## DHNN (Valeria & Rocio) \nDHNN is a UX/UI design & development agency. \n\n**Valeria**\n\nWith a strong background in product development and entrepreneurship, I am now a business developer specializing in the Web3 space. I have been involved in the Polkadot ecosystem for the past three years, collaborating with the Web3 Foundation, Parity Technologies, and various projects in both development and security audits for the runtime and pallets, as well as ink! smart contracts. The company I have supported has become a member of the Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) as auditors and the Polkadot Alpha Program as developers. We have lever lo aged our expertise to create Scout, a bug detection tool for ink! smart contracts. Currently, we are preparing for a new cybersecurity research challenge focused on automatically detecting security bugs in pallets and the runtime.\n\n**Rocio**\n\nAs a UX leader and Sr. Product Designer with a deep passion for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, I have dedicated the past seven years to advancing DeFi solutions. My journey includes leading the UX team at Buenbit, a crypto wallet serving over 1 million users, and designing ambitious NFT and DeFi projects from the ground up. Additionally, I've collaborated as a designer and consultant on several DeFi and NFT projects with renowned crypto artists such as PAK and Cryptomotors, and engaged with various LatAm communities, evangelizing and teaching best practices and user-centered design to drive massive adoption of blockchain solutions and interfaces. My goal is to foster blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption by infusing my enthusiasm and expertise into projects and overcoming adoption barriers by solving the common UX pains and frictions we usually find in blockchain platforms and ecosystems.\n\n## OpenGovWatch (Tommi & Ugur) \n\n**Tommi**\n\nTommi Enenkel, commonly known as Alice und Bob (Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn) co-founded ChaosDAO and OpenGov.Watch. He is a Web3 strategist specialized in ecosystem development, governance, analytics, and crypto-economics. In the past, he held CIO and CMO roles and has a background in systems software architecture and political communication. He holds a MSc in Knowledge Management and IT Security.

We are missing 3 curators to join as they are in holiday. \n\nPure Proxy: 16YDgheHwtmQ9UsmiuZEeVgFzdGF8rnctoEj5NHVTsQonBwe\nMultisig: 1fK6bvwDhLFtJ2WyvrGGC8AX3N8X6AbZZSTkydg9WHxidMJ (will change)\n\n————————————————\n\nWe wanted to take the time to address the recent concerns about bounty management and explain our approach to mitigate conflict of interests.\n\n\n\n# 1. Measures to manage conflict of interest\nWe have debated for a long time about the curator/executor conflict of interest. One of the main points we need to be conscious of is that finding UX expertise is more challenging than finding marketing expertise. \n\n\nRemoving the capability for our curators to work on tasks would be counterproductive, as our set of curators holds a big part of the UX expertise in the ecosystem. \n\nTo address this, we’ll be following those measures: \n\n1. Curators who are also executing tasks will <u>**abstain from voting on their own proposals**.</u>\n2. Projects executed by curators will <u>**undergo higher scrutiny**</u>, ensuring rigorous evaluation and validation before approval. \n3. All votes and decisions will be <u>**documented and made publicly accessible**</u> to maintain transparency and build community trust.\n\n\n\n\n# 2. Multisig Structure \n\nWith the Bounty Operator role, we are proposing a new setup that hasn't been used before. Braille, in this role, will need to be part of the multisig to expedite the signing process. \n\nWithout this, we rely on the Curators to handle this task, which (a) isn’t in their scope, and (b) is a significant time commitment, as we've seen in multiple discussions regarding bounty management. \n\nBraille will act as an <u>**automatic approver for all transactions**</u>, which won’t impact the results of the curator voting, as it will be accounted for in the multisig threshold.\n\n\n# 3. Illustrations \nStructure with an Operator: \n\n- The multisig is composed of 8 Curators and 1 Operator (Braille). \n- To get approval, 5 out of 8 Curators must approve a spending. \n- This is what we call a 5/8 multisig. \n\n⇒ With the Operator included, **the multisig becomes 6/9**, as the Operator will always approve every transaction.\n\n—\n\nStructure when Curators are abstaining because they are also Executors: \n- When a curator proposes to be an executor, they abstain from voting and are removed from the multisig threshold. \n- The multisig **passes from a 6/9 to a 6/8**. \n- The Curator still needs 6 approvals but has fewer possibilities as their vote is removed. \n\n⇒ This change represents a 10% increase in difficulty.\n\n\n# 4. List of Proposed Curators \n\nA table recap of each expertise brought by the teams.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/7J7YFsZ/21498-Braille-1721820947127.png)\n\nBelow, the bio of every curator. \n\n## SubWallet (DJ) \nA summa cum laude graduate from Washington and Lee University, DJ Hà Trang now works as Research Lead at SubWallet and contributes to making SubWallet one of the leading wallet in the Polkadot ecosystem with over 1,000,000 active users on 3 platforms: browser extension, mobile app and web dashboard.

End of 2022, he joined Parity as the DeFi Lead for the EcoDev team where he oversaw all DeFi BD initiatives both at the parachain level as well as support parachains teams at the dapp level. Nico also looked after infrastructure pieces like Oracles, Bridges, Stablecoins and others. \n\nNow as CEO of Velocity, he’ll be supporting the ecosystem with a more hands-on approach and by not only building, but helping builders build. Velocity is also the operator of the DeFi Infrastructure Bounty.\n\n## DHNN (Valeria & Rocio) \nDHNN is a UX/UI design & development agency. \n\n**Valeria**\n\nWith a strong background in product development and entrepreneurship, I am now a business developer specializing in the Web3 space.

The company I have supported has become a member of the Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) as auditors and the Polkadot Alpha Program as developers. We have lever lo aged our expertise to create Scout, a bug detection tool for ink! smart contracts. Currently, we are preparing for a new cybersecurity research challenge focused on automatically detecting security bugs in pallets and the runtime.\n\n**Rocio**\n\nAs a UX leader and Sr. Product Designer with a deep passion for the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, I have dedicated the past seven years to advancing DeFi solutions. My journey includes leading the UX team at Buenbit, a crypto wallet serving over 1 million users, and designing ambitious NFT and DeFi projects from the ground up. Additionally, I've collaborated as a designer and consultant on several DeFi and NFT projects with renowned crypto artists such as PAK and Cryptomotors, and engaged with various LatAm communities, evangelizing and teaching best practices and user-centered design to drive massive adoption of blockchain solutions and interfaces. My goal is to foster blockchain and cryptocurrency adoption by infusing my enthusiasm and expertise into projects and overcoming adoption barriers by solving the common UX pains and frictions we usually find in blockchain platforms and ecosystems.\n\n## OpenGovWatch (Tommi & Ugur) \n\n**Tommi**\n\nTommi Enenkel, commonly known as Alice und Bob (Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn) co-founded ChaosDAO and OpenGov.Watch.

I hope you guys can have some recommendation if it is not reasonable.\n\n~\n\nMy Tasks:\n1) Post interesting Polkadot related post on X everyday, at least **8 posts per day**, all posts will include at least one Polkadot related AI newly generated image. \n2) Post interesting Polkadot related post on Binance Square everyday, at least 8 posts per day, all posts will include at least one Polkadot related AI newly generated image. \n\n- *All posts are focus on educations, news, memes and analytics. \n- *All AI generated images are 100% newly generated by myself. \n- *Each posts will have a posting time gap around **30 minutes ~ 2 hours** to make sure constant active time to get more impressions.\n- *All posts will include text, emojis and image or video.\n\n~\n\nRequested DOT: 150 DOT for a period of 30 days\n\nThis is my first proposal on Polkadot Treasury, hope you guys can support me and I still have many interesting ideas to help promote Polkadot in future. \n\n~\n\nSkybaby\n\nI'm very good in Graphic matters",

The @Polkadot keyboard warrior on twitter. With clarity and thoughtfulness, knowledge was spread on the bird app.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/FWQ25WZ/ddaysd.jpg)\n\nActively recruiting the brightest minds, preparing them for the fight of the blackest night\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/1Tr31Xg/newdd.jpg)\n\nAnd took decisive action after community voting\\*\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/rM5157P/dday1.jpg)\n\nInclusivity of nerds has always been a beacon of our culture as a community, and we have proudly pointed our gun indiscriminately. (Also check out OpenGov, its like Winamp in the age of Spotify).\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Pmn6yDd/ddady2.jpg)\n\nFor this reason I, the Polkadot Team, would like to propose a Small Spender tip of 50 DOT for the keyboard warrior.\n\nWe are \\*KOLKADOT (ad paid by the Near Foundation)",

          "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am seeing some issues with the new Head Ambassador program. I believe full disclosure is necessary as to who is sponsoring them for greater community transparency.\n\n1. It has come to my attention that a hefty sum of 5K DOT Decision Deposit (DD) is required to apply for the Head Ambassador (HA) program. This translates to about $28,750 USD or ~5.75 * 5000 DOT. Many HA candidates have resorted to seeking sponsorships because of the steep barrier to entry.\n\n2. The DD was not mentioned in the original Ref: 487. You would think such a crucial detail should have been included in the ref. But, it wasn't: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/487\n\n3. Some in the community are calling this the Whale Ambassador Program. Including a former HA: Alex Promo Team: https://forum.polkadot.network/t/feedback-needed-new-head-ambassador-application-requirement/8549/43?u=alexpromoteam\n\nSo based on the above issues and in the spirit of transparency in OpenGov. I will request any HA that has successfully won their bid for the HA position to disclose who their sponsors are. This includes providing wallet addresses and Transaction IDs from the sponsors (It should add up to 5K DOT). It can be posted as \"HA Sponsorship Full Disclosure\" as a topic on Polka Assembly.",

      "title": "Recovering lost funds for local initiative",
      "content": "This proposal seeks to **recover 46.1 DOT lost due to a technical error** while pursuing a local Polkadot event. The event aimed to foster XR, AI, and Web3 collaboration in Finland but faced unexpected funding roadblocks due to discontinuation of advertised [Events Bounty](https://web3foundation.notion.site/Bounty-17-Community-Events-V2-45f16ac6c17b4d158ddcfee96f564561) support.\n\nThe [original proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GeGKg4Dx7fu21-pUdSCLVeoyjW7CCPgM/view?usp=sharing) (596 DOT) was for a launch event (an extraordinary event) that would be on a cool venue and set the stage for an extended hackathon and a series of recurring meetings, culminating in a Slush side event in November 2024.\n\nDue to the feedback from the Events Bounty curators, the event was scaled down, the venue was changed to smaller, the catering was reduced, the organiser fees were cut and the prizes to activate participants were slashed.\n\nThe [revised proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oxn1EjenzL9_1obFh5U0CPofCGFkati_/view?usp=sharing) was for merely 310 DOT. Since the Polkadot community in Finland is non-existing, the practicalities were to be organised by a student group (XES) that was eager to learn more and spread the Polkadot vibes to their entrepreneurial membership. As an ambassador, I helped them to set up the practicalities, to be able to receive the funding. For this, I had to give them 1.1 DOT existential deposit and lock up 45 DOT to pay for the multisig and pure proxy identity verification.\n\nAlthough we had submitted the application well in advance, we now started to run out of time. After multiple queries, we heard nothing from the Events Bounty. Ultimately, we had no choice but to pull the application. Then, we finally got a response: “_The Bounty has been in some flux as we prepare for either a renewal or a wind-down of operations._” This possibility, that the entire bounty was about to be discontinued, was not communicated to us earlier and we had been waiting in vain.\n\nI was frustrated, fatigued and under a lot of pressure. This led me to make a technical error with polkadot.js and caused the locked up DOT to be lost. I immediately asked for help on Polkadot Watercooler channel (Element) and, after a call with Radha from Web3 Foundation, got confirmation that the funds cannot be retrieved, even if Subscan still shows the pure proxy as active. These are the accounts in question:\n\n-   Pure proxy: 12NY5cguZUHNm5hhAxLMZXMtnKT3LZttgxuieSkoqevgQp8b\n-   Multisig: 12tp6EoXFwAucagB9BrKqud5XfBFQKm4LHg48xARHQnjQsmk\n\n**Who am I?**\n\n-   My name is [Tomi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomiastikainen/). I am a Polkadot Ambassador in Finland, since 2023.\n-   Even before that I was actively promoting the network globally. For instance, I wrote a Polkadot-friendly book called [Crypto Curious?](https://www.amazon.com/Crypto-Curious-when-investing-cryptoassets/dp/9526921534)\n-   Recently, I initiated a cross-chain collaboration project [Polkadot-Cardano uniFires](https://grillapp.net/12600/uni-fires-connecting-polkadot-and-cardano-communities-70737), securing 140,000 ADA from Cardano Project Catalyst to get things moving. We are now half-way through and the future looks promising.\n-   In Finland, I helped the student clubs to organise a Decoded viewing party, represented Polkadot in various events and explained Polkadot intricacies in a Finnish-language podcast.\n-   I am part of the team that helps active community members to get [sponsorships for Polkadot Decoded 2024](referenda/733).\n\nI spent months in preparation, partnership talks and coordination efforts, to no avail. After all these experiences, I am a little tired and disappointed, to say the least. To regain my motivation and to focus fully on the international initiatives underway, I am asking the community to reimburse the 46.1 DOT that I lost due to a technical error (and my own stupidity), acknowledging that this was all done in good faith, pursuing a local event for Polkadot promotion.\n\n\\---Read [the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YeF1XGXo68Zq9qFdYMF25jcLesIjZCws9vePtFBCktI/edit?usp=sharing) (same text as here)---",

      "content": "(this is a resubmission after Ref 708 failed due to a technical reason)\n\nThe Polkadot Fellowship has introduced a new `spend()` extrinsic.\n\nThis proposal aims to raise awareness about the new features it supports and to test it out by tipping Alice und Bob 69 USDT on AssetHub.\n\nThe new `spend()` extrinsic has been introduced with the Polkadot Runtime 1.1 upgrade. It supports:\n- multi-asset Treasury spends, e.g. DOT, USDT, USDC, etc...\n- from an XCM multi-location, e.g. AssetHub\n- to be paid out at a specific block\n\nThis new extrinsic makes a lot of things possible:\n- instant payments instead of waiting a spend cycle of up to 24 days\n- paying proposers in USD stables to remove exchange rate risk\n- setting up a payment plan of monthly payouts by batching multiple spends at estimated block heights\n  - and even canceling scheduled payments\n\nThis proposal is based on the information provided in [this forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/multi-asset-treasury-and-milestone-based-spends/6780) and [this instructional guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rq10o43E1jc-m6tEh2zvVDxjijsT775II81oYr2oyws/edit). It is intended to test if the extrinsic works as described. During the test, it was already discovered that the instructions are not exactly correct, as Polkadot.js tries to help the user by having value fields taking \"DOT\" values that add 10 decimals under the hood, which interferes with the GeneralIndex field of the assetKind location and the amount field. A wrongful [proposal 707](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/707) was the result. This proposal should have corrected values. But further errors might be possible since this was never before tested in production.\n\nI suggest sending 69 USDT because it's a funny number and it's related to Bitcoin\n\nThe call works as follows\n\nThe V3 AssetKind contains a V3 MultiLocation pointing to Parachain 1000 -> AssetHub. The AssetID is a relative location inside AssetHub pointing to PalletInstance 50 -> assets, GeneralIndex 1984 -> USDT\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNRZ6ybDT1PabJuS6k9VijFAxdSCDmkfqXLgHk6b2p8pu)\n\nThe amount is 69_000_000 (USDT is denominated with 6 decimals)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWXNh5FzNxiGkP1GPkqKitwp4JEtoZH3x8LAGECbU6sQ2)\n\nThe beneficiary is Polkalytics, the company account of Alice und Bob\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWUTTPEdrXUDAemSYi6qvUUX8j44SM6ih8VXiPd2bCTrM)",

It supports:\n- multi-asset Treasury spends, e.g. DOT, USDT, USDC, etc...\n- from an XCM multi-location, e.g. AssetHub\n- to be paid out at a specific block\n\nThis new extrinsic makes a lot of things possible:\n- instant payments instead of waiting a spend cycle of up to 24 days\n- paying proposers in USD stables to remove exchange rate risk\n- setting up a payment plan of monthly payouts by batching multiple spends at estimated block heights\n  - and even canceling scheduled payments\n\nThis proposal is based on the information provided in [this forum post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/multi-asset-treasury-and-milestone-based-spends/6780) and [this instructional guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rq10o43E1jc-m6tEh2zvVDxjijsT775II81oYr2oyws/edit). It is intended to test if the extrinsic works as described. During the test, it was already discovered that the instructions are not exactly correct, as Polkadot.js tries to help the user by having value fields taking \"DOT\" values that add 10 decimals under the hood, which interferes with the GeneralIndex field of the assetKind location and the amount field. A wrongful [proposal 707](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/707) was the result. This proposal should have corrected values. But further errors might be possible since this was never before tested in production.\n\nI suggest sending 69 USDT because it's a funny number and it's related to Bitcoin\n\nThe call works as follows\n\nThe V3 AssetKind contains a V3 MultiLocation pointing to Parachain 1000 -> AssetHub. The AssetID is a relative location inside AssetHub pointing to PalletInstance 50 -> assets, GeneralIndex 1984 -> USDT\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNRZ6ybDT1PabJuS6k9VijFAxdSCDmkfqXLgHk6b2p8pu)\n\nThe amount is 69_000_000 (USDT is denominated with 6 decimals)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWXNh5FzNxiGkP1GPkqKitwp4JEtoZH3x8LAGECbU6sQ2)\n\nThe beneficiary is Polkalytics, the company account of Alice und Bob\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWUTTPEdrXUDAemSYi6qvUUX8j44SM6ih8VXiPd2bCTrM)",

      "content": "VOTE NAY. THE PREIMAGE AND PROPOSAL IS PULLED Dear Polkadot Community, I am Nixon Javier ambassador of Polkadot (Parity) I speak to you as a content creator, dedicated to educating our community about cryptocurrencies and the exciting Polkadot ecosystem. For some time, I have had the privilege of sharing knowledge and promoting the adoption of this innovative technology through my tutorial videos, mainly on YouTube. Unfortunately, I find myself facing a significant challenge that threatens my ability to continue contributing effectively. My computer, my main tool for creating content, is on the verge of total failure. Without a quick fix, my ability to maintain the production of quality educational content will be severely compromised. At this time when people are becoming interested in cryptocurrencies again, it is when it is most necessary to provide quality content to the audience and make them aware of all the incredible tools within the Polkadot ecosystem. This last month my channel has been increasing +400% on all metrics, this is incredible news as you can see that I am being recommended to the right audience and I can show the incredible Polkadot ecosystem to many more people. Therefore, I humbly propose that the Polkadot community support me in this proposal to help me get a new computer. This investment will allow me to continue creating video tutorials, articles, and general content that promotes the understanding and adoption of Polkadot. I ensure that the community will have continued access to valuable resources that encourage the understanding and use of Polkadot,and providing quality educational content, I will contribute to increasing the adoption of Polkadot among a broader audience. The amount requested for the acquisition of a new computer is 240 DOT. This amount will cover the total cost including all taxes. In summary, I request the support of the Polkadot community to ensure the continuity of my educational work. I am committed to continuing to be an asset to our community and working tirelessly to advance the values ​​and vision of Polkadot. Thank you very much in advance for considering my proposal and for your continued support!

In a 30-minute live presentation, we explained Polkadot fundamentals, the latest developments, and some Polakdot parachains and products to a local audience of **~**50 people who are completely unfamiliar with the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n- The presentation is recorded, edited, and shared on YouTube afterward with subtitle support: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbgkSSS06AY\n- [Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1H--Li44eA6xXiLm7uaRMQGJ6KfAXNLSGcHplrAvT_eM/edit?usp=sharing)\n- Photos from the event: https://x.com/blockandwine/status/1755187823685042224\n\nWe request a retroactive tip of 1,260 EUR (1,050 EUR + VAT) for the entire effort of presentation and editing for the video.\n\n**Cost Breakdown**\n\n| Cost Components | hours | EUR/h | Amount (EUR) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Meetup presentation preparation | 6 | 125 | 750 |\n| Video editing & subtitles | 6 | 50 | 300 |\n| SUM |  |  | 1,050 |\n| 20% VAT |  |  | 210 |\n| TOTAL |  |  | 1,260 |\n\nThe time of the service rendered lies before our contract with the W3F came into effect.\n\n**About Polkalytics**\n\n**[Polkalytics](https://www.polkalytics.io/)** is an analytics boutique that offers data-driven reporting and consulting for Polkadot. Polkalytics builds a Google-scale analytics service for Polkadot. The first product is Polkadot Account Reports: Personalized Reports that enable people and businesses to file their taxes and gain insights into their Polkadot activities.\n\nPolkalytics was founded by **Tommi Enenkel**, commonly known as **Alice und Bob** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0alQ35JKnMo_ctzYITthbw), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin/)). Alice und Bob founded [ChaosDAO](https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) and received Polkadot and Kusama Treasury tips for content and software contributions in the past.

      "title": "Reimbursement for lost pool rewards",
      "content": "This proposal aims to reimburse 50 pool members that didn't receive various amounts of pool rewards due to [this bug](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/3110), which was fixed in the latest runtime upgrade. \n\nIn short, when a pool enters the destroying phase anyone can permissionlessly unbond the pool members. When that happens any pending rewards are claimed. This bug caused the rewards to be sent to the caller of the `unbond` extrinsic, instead of the actual pool member.\n\nWe ran [this Python script](https://gist.github.com/michalisFr/a59d9da2b346a581aa8dedc171393534) to find the affected accounts and the rewards they didn't receive (credit to Kian who wrote it). The results can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gH6N-5YSz9Ip6UYv5MDc47_ePKpC2GbU/view?usp=sharing). I'd appreciate any cross checks to make sure the batch call has been built correctly and the proper amounts will be sent to the correct recipients.\n\nTo be clear, this is a double spend. These rewards have already been claimed by the pool owners who called the `unbond` extrinsics. But given that the amount is small, and trying to contact all these pool owners to return the misappropriated rewards would be troublesome to say the least, we believe this proposal is the most straightforward way to make these pool members whole and we'd appreciate it if the community approved it.",

Initially designed and developed to solve a very specific problem: of people not being able to keep up to the ongoing without the noise the main fellowship channel implies, and free of curation bias — as it is a bot, now it's a great explorer tool that fellows can use to find out the discussions ongoing on the week, go to the links of proposals and even get the link to the RFC pull request on GitHub.\n\n![][ipfs:bafybeihgzs6g6whpd6djo4625s27wh7adub3pukjbyhd7kj744nfshzqva]\n\nSince then, I've been developing this solution for the community self-funded, and I aim to let it have a future. I'm requesting `$1,600` (@ `7.365` DOT / EMA7) as retroactive for 32 hours of work in this project that's currently being used by members in the Polkadot Fellowship.\n\n## Future Outlook\n\nOf course, this won't be the end of it. A series of proposals for improving it and making it WAY more useful than it already is are underway:\n\n- Decentralizing the bot by making it a Light Client.\n- Updating voting count of referenda based of on-chain events.\n- Using ML to summarize RFCs and give people insights.\n- Opening threads for people to discuss in the [Fellowship RFCs Referenda channel][#fellowship-rfcs:bloque.team].\n- Personalized digest based on interests of every member, sent daily or weekly via DM.\n- More bots and channels! One for every type of referenda (Runtimes, XCM calls, RFCs, Help Desk, etc.).\n\n[subscan:user:pandres95//polkadot]: https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/12gMhxHw8QjEwLQvnqsmMVY1z5gFa54vND74aMUbhhwN6mJR\n\n[gh:fellowship-referenda-bot]: https://github.com/pandres95/fellowship-referenda-bot\n[ipfs:bafybeihgzs6g6whpd6djo4625s27wh7adub3pukjbyhd7kj744nfshzqva]: https://bafybeihgzs6g6whpd6djo4625s27wh7adub3pukjbyhd7kj744nfshzqva.ipfs.nftstorage.link/\n[#fellowship-rfcs:bloque.team]: https://matrix.to/#/#fellowship-rfcs:bloque.team",

Its primary function is to calculate staking rewards based on the time period a user is staking their DOT tokens. This not only empowers users to make informed decisions about their staking strategy but also contributes to the overall growth and stability of the Polkadot network.\n\nUser Friendly Interface: When creating Polkalotor the priority was creating user-friendly interface, ensuring that both novice and experienced users can easily navigate Polkalator.\n\nFuture Plans:\n\n-   Multi-Chain Compatibility: Extend Polkalator's functionality to support staking calculations across multiple - chains within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n-   Advanced Analytics: Introduce advanced analytics tools to provide users with in-depth insights into staking performance and potential rewards.\n-   The project aims to establish a central hub where users can explore all staking and liquid staking options within the ecosystem. This will enable them to make informed decisions about which staking option best suits them.\n\nIf this proposal passes, I'll be setting up a custom domain in no time!\n\n[https://polkalator.vercel.app/](https://polkalator.vercel.app/)",

Six (Head Ambassador), Angela (Ambassador, UAE) in Dubai, and Viktor and Gabo (Ambassadors, Hungary) in Budapest. The event included a brunch, and we provided food and beverages for the attendees. Our goal was to educate the attendees and plan how to nurture future decentralized projects in the ecosystem. We succeeded in coming up with new project ideas and our special achievement came after: we signed an agreement with Dubai Blockchain Center, so we get support from the government and free locations for Polkadot events. Therefore we are asking for your feedback and votes.\n\n**Event Summary**\n\nWe recently organized two comprehensive workshops exploring strategies for effective Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). For that, we held one-day hackathons in Dubai and Budapest, drawing a significant number of participants. The event aimed to educate attendees on decentralized governance and the Polkadot network, combining theory with practical application. Participants actively engaged with DAO concepts, leading to the development of innovative ideas. \nWe focused on encouraging member participation in voting while ensuring fairness in the ecosystem. Together, these initiatives contribute to advancing our understanding and implementation of DAO strategies. This summary paper captures the main insights from our discussions and proposes a holistic governance approach for DAOs.\n\n**Success metrics and special achievement**\n\nFollowing a successful showcase to the Dubai Future Foundation, where we demonstrated Polkadot's capacity to host impactful and innovative events, we are delighted to announce that they have generously offered us free access to dedicated space for all future Polkadot-related events.\n\nAttendee feedback score: 8.5/10\n\nNumber of on-site attendees: 13 in Dubai, 14 in Budapest\n\nOnline attendees: 5\n\nSocial interactions: 100+\n\nProject ideas created: 5\n\nWhat we learned about organizing the event:\nThe workshop part was highly educational, top feedback received\nFood was very good in Dubai, but a bit expensive compared to other locations\nWe need to start announcing earlier and we could have more attendees by that\nMax limit is 30 participant/location for an such event, having more would not be efficient\n\nYou can find our event-specific education material shared for free:\nhttps://www.canva.com/design/DAFzGtsLNcM/JqRFL04fBPylvdkiMAsXjA/edit?utm_content=DAFzGtsLNcM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton\n\nMeetup.com events:\nhttps://www.meetup.com/polkadot-and-kusama-dubai/events/296926925/ (37 registrants)\nhttps://www.meetup.com/polkadot-hungary/events/296990262/ (15 registrants)\n\nPlease find the details, invoices, pictures and all related information in the docs we shared:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1oruaeIXjSQfBGb93VrEqz4P6UgvWKRSkemf23VsUKLs/edit?usp=sharing\n",

      "content": "What if we crafted a book to enlighten future generations about the history of Polkadot, blockchain, and the economic revolution of our era? An illustrated masterpiece delving into the essence of a universal coin! This endeavor could contribute to the creation of a legend, a myth that resonates within the Polkadot community.\n\n**it's necessary to strat creating a collective memory in polkadot community, this is done by developing the culture.**\n\n**Illustrated Book: \"The Sacred Coin Quest\" - Continuing the Creation of Culture in Polkadot**\n\nIntroduction: The culture of a community is a great common experiences, molding the collective perception of the world. Polkadot have the potencial, with cultural elements such as the economy, governance, and group activities evolving into traditions, thus constructing the cultural identity of the network and its members. Community in polkadot is growing, new generation of participants (developers, invertor, artist, validators, chains...) appear every moment and need collective memory follow the victory!  It is a passion for what we do and a shared love for those with whom we work. This is how culture is born.\n\nMotivation and Project:\n\nIn this culturally moment for Polkadot, I aspire to contribute a grain of sand to this vast \"beach\" by creating an \"odyssey\"—a narrative that resonates with those present, those yet to come, and those observing. I present \"The Sacred Coin Quest,\" an illustrated book that sprouted a year ago when I sensed the passion driving this blockchain, Polkadot. Now, I feel ready to undertake this project with the seriousness it deserves, constructing a magnificent world for all of you. My goal is to entertain with stories and educate about the ideals of Polkadot.\n\nSynopsis of \"The Sacred Coin Quest\":\n\nThe story of \"The Sacred Coin Quest\" is set in the year 2140, in a world deeply divided between blockchain and fiat currencies. While there is greater control over resources, the population is fragmented between those seeking freedom through cryptocurrencies, known as the \"free people,\" and the \"villagers,\" who serve the imposed fiat system. This scenario raises questions about power, freedom, and the influence of financial choices on society.\n\nPersefone, our protagonist, embarks on a journey through this divided world. Inspired by the quest for information about blockchain usage and understanding, she gradually discovers the nuances and complexities of Polkadot. This knowledge journey not only explores the workings and development of Polkadot but also delves into the political, social, and psychological themes defining the society constructed in this dystopian future, drawing inspiration from literary works like \"Brave New World\" and \"1984.\"\n\nPersefone's fate intertwines with that of Gavin, a man whose role triggers her quest for the \"coin of everything.\" This sacred coin, with unique characteristics, becomes the central axis of the narrative as Persefone embarks on an adventure to find it and potentially save the world from the division and control imposed by different forms of currency.\n\nThroughout her journey, Persefone encounters notable figures from the blockchain world, providing an educational window into concepts such as Bitcoin maximalism and, of course, the essence of Polkadot and the true decentralization of the world.\n\n\"The Sacred Coin Quest\" not only offers an exciting adventure but also serves as an educational tool about blockchain technology and the fundamental role of Polkadot in constructing a decentralized future. The narrative becomes a rich exploration of diverse societies, social relationships, and the importance of diversity in a world driven by financial decisions.\n\nThis project, aimed at contributing to Polkadot's culture, seeks to transcend the barriers of time and become a work that resonates with those living it, those inheriting it, and those observing it. Join Persefone in her quest for the \"coin of everything\" and discover a magnificent world full of intrigue, learning, and action!\n\nStory Structure:\n\nThe project is structured into nine chapters (books), each representing a region of the world, reflecting the expansion of Polkadot:\n\n**Chapter I: Vienna Chapter**\n\n**II: North America**\n\n**III: Journey to South America Chapter**\n\n**IV: Romania Chapter**\n\n**V: Russia Chapter**\n\n**VI: China Chapter**\n\n**VII: The Dream Chapter**\n\n**VIII: Encounter with Satoshi Chapter**\n\n**IX: The Coin of Everything**\n\nEducation and Technical Themes:\n\nEach chapter will become a book that combines adventure with education about Polkadot, from understanding a public key to designing a blockchain using Substrate, create a colective memory!\n\nInitial Phase - Small Tipper:\n\nIn the first step, \"Small Tipper,\" I seek a small initial fund to dedicate time to story development, including world-building, characters, conflict ideas, plot, and subplot. This solid foundation will allow the community to contribute by voting on the themes and plots to address, creating a decentralized story.\n\nRequirements and Development Plan:\n\nI will need at least a month to document the idea and structure it properly, acquire the necessary software for writing, and create initial sketches. I have a talented Italian friend in NFT art who will illustrate the first cover. Regarding funding.\n\nI am initially requesting 250 DOT.\n\nExecution Plan:\n\nIf the proposal is approved, after completing the first phase, the plan is to move to a second funding round (\"Big Tripper\"), where the first chapters will be developed and published. I will officially hire illustrators and professionals to correct and translate the firt chapter into various languages.\n\nEconomic Autonomy and Community Contribution:\n\nOnce economic autonomy is achieved, I will stop seeking funding from Polkadot, actively contributing to the community and building an ecosystem where the story can grow collaboratively, maybe some FRAME dedicate for this. The goal is exciting and ambitious, but I believe Polkadot deserves individuals dedicating time and effort to its development; this project may endure in history.\n\nAuthor's Identity and Experience:\n\nI am Munay, nobody in particular. I work with artists and initiated a project called [nunaproject.art](https://nunaproject.art/) , (I am the CEO) two years ago, aiming to introduce artists to technology and help them use blockchain for their daily artistic endeavors (craftsmen, painters, poets, musicians). It would be amazing to join forces with Polkadot's network in the future.\n\nConclusion: I am thrilled to participate in this community.

Polkadot has the potencial, with cultural elements such as the economy, governance, and group activities evolving into traditions, thus constructing the cultural identity of the network and its members. It is a passion for what we do and a shared love for those with whom we work. This is how culture is born.\n\nMotivation and Project:\n\nIn this culturally moment for Polkadot, I aspire to contribute a grain of sand to this vast \"beach\" by creating an \"odyssey\"—a narrative that resonates with those present, those yet to come, and those observing. I present \"The Sacred Coin Quest,\" an illustrated book that sprouted a year ago when I sensed the passion driving this blockchain, Polkadot. Now, I feel ready to undertake this project with the seriousness it deserves, constructing a magnificent world for all of you. My goal is to entertain with stories and educate about the ideals of Polkadot.\n\nSynopsis of \"The Sacred Coin Quest\":\n\nThe story of \"The Sacred Coin Quest\" is set in the year 2140, in a world deeply divided between blockchain and fiat currencies. While there is greater control over resources, the population is fragmented between those seeking freedom through cryptocurrencies, known as the \"free people,\" and the \"villagers,\" who serve the imposed fiat system. This scenario raises questions about power, freedom, and the influence of financial choices on society.\n\nPersefone, our protagonist, embarks on a journey through this divided world. Inspired by the quest for information about blockchain usage and understanding, she gradually discovers the nuances and complexities of Polkadot. This knowledge journey not only explores the workings and development of Polkadot but also delves into the political, social, and psychological themes defining the society constructed in this dystopian future, drawing inspiration from literary works like \"Brave New World\" and \"1984.\"\n\nPersefone's fate intertwines with that of Gavin, a man whose role triggers her quest for the \"coin of everything.\" This sacred coin, with unique characteristics, becomes the central axis of the narrative as Persefone embarks on an adventure to find it and potentially save the world from the division and control imposed by different forms of currency.\n\nThroughout her journey, Persefone encounters notable figures from the blockchain world, providing an educational window into concepts such as Bitcoin maximalism and, of course, the essence of Polkadot and the true decentralization of the world.\n\n\"The Sacred Coin Quest\" not only offers an exciting adventure but also serves as an educational tool about blockchain technology and the fundamental role of Polkadot in constructing a decentralized future. The narrative becomes a rich exploration of diverse societies, social relationships, and the importance of diversity in a world driven by financial decisions.\n\nThis project, aimed at contributing to Polkadot's culture, seeks to transcend the barriers of time and become a work that resonates with those living it, those inheriting it, and those observing it. Join Persefone in her quest for the \"coin of everything\" and discover a magnificent world full of intrigue, learning, and action!\n\nStory Structure:\n\nThe project is structured into nine chapters (books), each representing a region of the world, reflecting the expansion of Polkadot:\n\n**Chapter I: Vienna Chapter**\n\n**II: North America**\n\n**III: Journey to South America Chapter**\n\n**IV: Romania Chapter**\n\n**V: Russia Chapter**\n\n**VI: China Chapter**\n\n**VII: The Dream Chapter**\n\n**VIII: Encounter with Satoshi Chapter**\n\n**IX: The Coin of Everything**\n\nEducation and Technical Themes:\n\nEach chapter will become a book that combines adventure with education about Polkadot, from understanding a public key to designing a blockchain using Substrate, create a colective memory!\n\nInitial Phase - Small Tipper:\n\nIn the first step, \"Small Tipper,\" I seek a small initial fund to dedicate time to story development, including world-building, characters, conflict ideas, plot, and subplot. This solid foundation will allow the community to contribute by voting on the themes and plots to address, creating a decentralized story.\n\nRequirements and Development Plan:\n\nI will need at least a month to document the idea and structure it properly, acquire the necessary software for writing, and create initial sketches. I have a talented Italian friend in NFT art who will illustrate the first cover. Regarding funding.\n\nI am initially requesting 250 DOT.\n\nExecution Plan:\n\nIf the proposal is approved, after completing the first phase, the plan is to move to a second funding round (\"Big Tripper\"), where the first chapters will be developed and published. I will officially hire illustrators and professionals to correct and translate the firt chapter into various languages.\n\nEconomic Autonomy and Community Contribution:\n\nOnce economic autonomy is achieved, I will stop seeking funding from Polkadot, actively contributing to the community and building an ecosystem where the story can grow collaboratively, maybe some FRAME dedicate for this. The goal is exciting and ambitious, but I believe Polkadot deserves individuals dedicating time and effort to its development; this project may endure in history.\n\nAuthor's Identity and Experience:\n\nI am Munay, nobody in particular. I work with artists and initiated a project called [nunaproject.art](https://nunaproject.art/) , (I am the CEO) two years ago, aiming to introduce artists to technology and help them use blockchain for their daily artistic endeavors (craftsmen, painters, poets, musicians).

Now, I feel ready to undertake this project with the seriousness it deserves, constructing a magnificent world for all of you. My goal is to entertain with stories and educate about the ideals of Polkadot.\n\n**Synopsis of \"The Sacred Coin Quest\":**\n\nThe story of \"The Sacred Coin Quest\" is set in the year 2140, in a world deeply divided between blockchain and fiat currencies. While there is greater control over resources, the population is fragmented between those seeking freedom through cryptocurrencies, known as the \"free people,\" and the \"villagers,\" who serve the imposed fiat system. This scenario raises questions about power, freedom, and the influence of financial choices on society.\n\nPersefone, our protagonist, embarks on a journey through this divided world. Inspired by the quest for information about blockchain usage and understanding, she gradually discovers the nuances and complexities of Polkadot. This knowledge journey not only explores the workings and development of Polkadot but also delves into the political, social, and psychological themes defining the society constructed in this dystopian future, drawing inspiration from literary works like \"Brave New World\" and \"1984.\"\n\nPersefone's fate intertwines with that of Gavin, a man whose role triggers her quest for the \"coin of everything.\" This sacred coin, with unique characteristics, becomes the central axis of the narrative as Persefone embarks on an adventure to find it and potentially save the world from the division and control imposed by different forms of currency.\n\nThroughout her journey, Persefone encounters notable figures from the blockchain world, providing an educational window into concepts such as Bitcoin maximalism and, of course, the essence of Polkadot and the true decentralization of the world.\n\n\"The Sacred Coin Quest\" not only offers an exciting adventure but also serves as an educational tool about blockchain technology and the fundamental role of Polkadot in constructing a decentralized future. The narrative becomes a rich exploration of diverse societies, social relationships, and the importance of diversity in a world driven by financial decisions.\n\nThis project, aimed at contributing to Polkadot's culture, seeks to transcend the barriers of time and become a work that resonates with those living it, those inheriting it, and those observing it. Join Persefone in her quest for the \"coin of everything\" and discover a magnificent world full of intrigue, learning, and action!\n\n**Story Structure:**\n\nThe project is structured into nine chapters (books), each representing a region of the world, reflecting the expansion of Polkadot:\n\nI: Vienna Chapter\n\nII: North America Chapter\n\nIII: Journey to South America Chapter\n\nIV: Romania Chapter\n\nV: Russia Chapter\n\nVI: China Chapter\n\nVII: The Dream Chapter\n\nVIII: Encounter with Satoshi Chapter\n\nIX: The Coin of Everything\n\n**Education and Technical Themes:**\n\nEach chapter will become a book that combines adventure with education about Polkadot, from understanding a public key to designing a blockchain using Substrate.\n\n**Initial Phase - Small Tipper:**\n\nIn the first step, \"Small Tipper,\" I seek a small initial fund to dedicate time to story development, including world-building, characters, conflict ideas, plot, and subplot. This solid foundation will allow the community to contribute by voting on the themes and plots to address, creating a decentralized story.\n\n**Requirements and Development Plan:**\n\nI will need at least a month to document the idea and structure it properly, acquire the necessary software for writing, and create initial sketches.\n\nI have a talented Italian friend in NFT art who will illustrate the first cover. Regarding funding.\n\nI am initially requesting 250 DOT.\n\n**Execution Plan:**\n\nIf the proposal is approved, after completing the first phase, the plan is to move to a second funding round (\"Big Tripper\"), where the first chapters will be developed and published. I will officially hire illustrators and professionals to correct and translate the firt chapter into various languages.\n\n**Economic Autonomy and Community Contribution:**\n\nOnce economic autonomy is achieved, I will stop seeking funding from Polkadot, actively contributing to the community and building an ecosystem where the story can grow collaboratively, maybe create some FRAME dedicate for this community creation. The goal is exciting and ambitious, but I believe Polkadot deserves individuals dedicating time and effort to its development; this project may endure in history.\n\n**Author's Identity and Experience:** I am Munay, nobody in particular. I work with artists and initiated a project called \"nunaproject.art\" two years ago, aiming to introduce artists to technology and help them use blockchain for their daily artistic endeavors (craftsmen, painters, poets, musicians). It would be amazing to join forces with Polkadot's network and my project of art in the future.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI am thrilled to participate in this community. Viva Polkadot! tl: @munaytu. I would be delighted to receive feedback, ideas, and questions.",

I'd like to bring your attention to an exceptional contribution made in a [recent Pull Request](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-api/pull/200). This PR stands out because of its significant impact on dApp development, particularly in reducing the bundle sizes of dApp assets.\n\nWe understand the value of such contributions, as evidenced by our team's previous efforts. One of our team members spent a couple of days researching this issue, and while it was considered a \"nice to have\" rather than a high priority, our findings (detailed [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-api/issues/198#issuecomment-1825864550)) only scratched the surface. The work accomplished in this PR, however, has far surpassed our initial efforts.\n\nGiven the exceptional nature of this contribution, I strongly recommend that we offer a medium tip of 80 DOTs to the contributor. Such recognition not only rewards their hard work but also fosters a spirit of collaboration and excellence in our community.\n\nThank you for considering this request.\n\nBest regards,\n\nJosep",

      "content": "I am Elektro, a Gavin Wood fan, ambassador for Unique Network and a professional translator with many years of experience working with both large and small companies. I have the skills and expertise to handle this project in a serious manner.\n\nI want to emphasize that only now, as I see the treasury investing much more pragmatically in things that actually create value for Polkadot (and so for all of us), I felt confident to bring this project forward to the community, that is why the contribution I'm requesting is very reasonable.\n\nI will undertake the costs of proofreading, audio editing, production, and voice-over recording myself. I'm only asking for less than I would request just for a text translation.\n\nThe final price per minute will be exactly $13.70, slightly lower than the initial requested amount in the discussion. I want you to personally compare this price to other high-quality contributors and the general market. This is in no way meant to create competition for others or to show off, but to emphasize that the contribution I'm requesting does not actually cover the full cost of this project. It is not for my personal enrichment, but merely to partially cover the opportunity cost of starting this project - expanding Polkadot's reach to the Italian community and improving the weak areas in this field. To be multi-chain we must also be multi-lingual.\n\nThis specific proposal is related to the first video of the Polkadot 2023.\n\nTo keep costs as low as possible, I've decided to not incur marketing costs for now. If needed, I will add them to the proposal for the next videos, making it work retrospectively for all previously posted videos as well. If possible, I will try to rationalize the costs even further for the next videos.\n\nHere is a summary of the biggest issues this proposal will solve:\n\n**Incomplete information**: The information that reaches the Italian community is summarized briefly in Italian, which omits the complexity and details covered in the full discussions.\n\n**Chronological order**: Information reaches the Italian community out of chronological order, arriving in pieces rather than complete concepts. As a result, summaries are posted in the wrong sequence, potentially causing confusion.\n\n**Misinformation**: As information passes through the users with English proficiency, it may deviate from the original source, either unintentionally due to incomplete understanding, or deliberately to obscure, alter, or insert details that serve certain interests. This issue is particularly concerning in crypto groups unaffiliated with Polkadot, where language barriers could enable unfair competitive practices.\n\n**Language barrier**: According to the latest EF English Proficiency Index of 2022, Italy ranks 32 out of 35 in Europe and only 13% of Italians speak English\n\n**Lack of content**: There is a clear shortage of Polkadot-related content for Italian speakers. Translating this major event would be an important first step in addressing that need.\n\n**Subtitles**: When Polkadot content is available in Italian, it is usually just subtitled. While better than nothing, subtitles can be distracting or demotivating for viewers. Providing full Italian voice-overs exponentially enhances the video quality and accessibility exponentially.\n\n**Inclusivity**: Providing Italian dubbing also makes this content accessible to blind Italians who do not speak English..\n\n**Survivorship bias**: While focusing on the English proficiency of the already existing Italians on Polkadot, we overlook potential newcomers deterred by language barriers. This is especially relevant as some Polkadot projects aim to seamlessly onboard users from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0.\n\n**Multi-lingual Polkadot**: When Polkadot becomes widely adopted, it will be important to have key information and materials qualitatively translated into Italian (and other major world languages as well). High-quality Italian language resources need to already be available, since creating them takes time.\n\nFull proposal: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQ2lcBKiDD5lyhz7eokdlcdyxCqoB0dWPToFhvMl\\_HI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CQ2lcBKiDD5lyhz7eokdlcdyxCqoB0dWPToFhvMl_HI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginal post: \"Hello everyone!

I am reaching out because I'm noticing that the Polkadot treasury is becoming more discerning in its investments. This has given me the confidence to propose my assistance in expanding Polkadot's presence in the Italian speaking market. I've been a Polkadot enthusiast for a while now, and I'm excited to also dive into the community discussions and proposals (hoping I do nothing wrong). I am a professional translator with years of experience in the sector. I have all the necessary tools and skills for a project like this. Inspired by the work of Sara (sprin), a Polkadot Ambassador who provided an excellent Spanish dubbing for Polkadot Decoded 2022. As I'm relatively new to the space, I'd like to offer a competitive rate of 14$ per minute. There are a total of 88 videos for Polkadot Decoded 2023, amounting to 1890 minutes. To gauge interest from the Italian-speaking audience and the Polkadot community, I'm willing to dub one video from the compilation entirely for free. This will showcase the high-quality work I can provide. If allowed, I can also share my Fiverr profile, where I've been serving clients since 2017. Before proceeding, I'd like to know obviously if the community is interested in this proposal. If there IS some interest, I'd appreciate guidance on the technical aspects of proposals (any recommended resources, links, tips, etc...) and any additional information I should be aware of or provide. I look forward to your insights and feedback!\"",

      "content": "**Updated Situation:**\n\n**![](https://i.ibb.co/8042Wg8/NAY.png)**\n\nHello @Polkadot friends VOTE NAY to referendum 144, we are currently going to pause the proposal, we noticed an unusual activity on our account regarding comments on YouTube videos, so we spoke to the marketing agency that does our external marketing (We only create the content, the person responsible for marketing who manages the page) and the activities carried out on the account were questioned\n\n(Our statistics regarding views and likes are correct, however we noticed that the comments do not match the content!)\n\n. We were informed that paid promotions (ads) were carried out for the respective pages and videos, but we noticed that there were comments that did not match our content. In this way, making it part of something we do not agree with. The quality of our content and the educational way we deal with the community does not change, however, as we do not support activities such as those highlighted, we chose to suspend the respective proposal. We will continue making videos about Polkadot, educating the community and bringing the best content as we always do. We will take all reasonable steps to identify the source of activities we do not recognize and remedy them. Our actions:\n\n1- We will cancel the agency’s marketing service provision 2-We will suspend the promotion through paid promotions (ads) 3-We will pause the proposal to align with the correct and honest standards of the Polkadot community\n\nWe reaffirm our commitment and objective to foster the Portuguese-speaking community and continue to be the reference on @Polkadot in Brazil\n\nHonestly VDS TEAM\n\n**![](https://i.ibb.co/c8Lgkq6/Tips-01-Cover.png)**\n\n**Short description:**\n\nWe are a Brazilian channel (Verbo da Sabedoria) that brings educational content to the Portuguese speaking community (Brazil, Portugal, Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau and Mozambique) through videos, articles and also dubbing. The team consists of John Rhodel (Parachainboy), Carlos Sawaki (CJ) and Gabriel Bonugli (Gabekoin), We request retroactive funding for 4 videos produced about news from the Polkadot ecosystem. We'll request funds every 4 videos. Thus always keeping the delivery in the first place and ordering after reaching the goals.\n\n**Our Links:**\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/vdscripto](https://twitter.com/vdscripto)  \nYoutube: [https://www.youtube.com/@vdscripto](https://www.youtube.com/@vdscripto)  \nMedium: [https://medium.com/@verbodasabedoria](https://medium.com/@verbodasabedoria)  \nTelegram: [https://t.me/verbodasabedoria](https://t.me/verbodasabedoria)\n\n**Why portuguese speakers and Brazil?**\n\nBrazil has stood as one of the world's leading economies, and in 2022, the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) amounted to a staggering BRL 9.9 trillion. This figure reflects the sum of all wealth produced within Brazilian territory during that year, underscoring Brazil's importance on the global economic stage.\n\nLooking at the latest data, we can see that in the first quarter of 2023, Brazil's GDP reached BRL 2,556.5 billion. This suggests that the Brazilian economy maintained a strong and steady pace of growth, which is a positive sign for the future.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/18y8vd5/Tips-01-BR.png)\n\n**Brazil and Crypto:**\n\nAccording to new data released by the Federal Revenue Service, Brazil now has almost 10 million cryptocurrency investors, the highest number since the agency began receiving declarations of digital assets from individuals and brokers based in the country.\n\nIn the report for the month of April, the Revenue registered 1,996,165 CPFs (Brazilian individual taxpayer registry identification) involved in crypto transactions, 19.2% more than in March. The number of CNPJs (National Registry of Legal Entities) also increased: for the first time, it surpassed 65,000.\n\nThe growth occurred amid a broad recovery of Bitcoin in the first months of the year. Now, the digital currency rose strongly and briefly reached $30,000, almost a 100% increase compared to its worst moment in 2022, in November..\n\nBrazil, the largest and most populated country in Latin America, has emerged as a significant player in digital and financial technology, fueled by its young median age of 32 and high mobile and internet usage rates. The country boasts around 212 million inhabitants and is ranked fifth globally in terms of cryptocurrency ownership.Brazil is the fifth largest cryptocurrency market on the planet, behind only India, USA, Russia and Nigeria, as shown by the study carried out by Binance and TripleA. Currently, more than 10 million Brazilians invest in assets, already surpassing the approximately 4 million Brazilian investors in B3 (like nasdaq and sp500 for brazilians).\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/8ghySDf/Tips-01-BR-02.png)\n\n**Context of the proposal:**\n\nRetroactive funding for 4 videos made between the periods of July 26th to August 19th, 2023, the amount requested for this small tip would be 250 DOT for the 4 videos, every 4 videos we intend to bring a retroactive request for delivery , with statistical and informative data.\n\n1 - [https://youtu.be/PEc2VihI4iM?si=voIrQOVR5W\\_PIBzn](https://youtu.be/PEc2VihI4iM?si=voIrQOVR5W_PIBzn) - Teddy Dao e Caridade  \n2 - [https://youtu.be/acz78cCpNDM?si=TML43vrKKyvsqUnt](https://youtu.be/acz78cCpNDM?si=TML43vrKKyvsqUnt) - Golpes x Polkadot  \n3 - [https://youtu.be/dOO0bkvdhKY?si=i\\_SJtypOMo5DbhzF](https://youtu.be/dOO0bkvdhKY?si=i_SJtypOMo5DbhzF) - Blockchain Academy  \n4 - [https://youtu.be/CxMPEUKDSvA?si=Yxhy0x4sCPMcpm4V](https://youtu.be/CxMPEUKDSvA?si=Yxhy0x4sCPMcpm4V) - Onde encontrar as melhores infos?\n\n**![](https://i.ibb.co/tBdHtQB/Tips-01-Videos.png)**\n\n**You can check the entire detailed proposal here:**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvZysX0dI0AfHi1ZROtfb0m6UAkHVLbCf6GefEbpDLc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LvZysX0dI0AfHi1ZROtfb0m6UAkHVLbCf6GefEbpDLc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Metrics and statistics Youtube (26 July - 19 August):**\n\n**Followers (3,56 K):**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/ZcCM2sC/vds-cripto.jpg)\n\n**Statistics videos Views + Hours:  \n\\*Subtitles:  \nVisualizações = Views  \nTempo de exibição(horas) = Display time (hours)**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/z503c0d/videos.jpg)\n\n**Views Country Target top 5:**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/10nDSNX/views.jpg)\n\n**Views Followers/Not Followers:**\n\n**\\*Subtitles:**  \n**Não inscrito = not subscribed**  \n**Inscrito = subscribed**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/4sSdgb4/inscritos-e-nao-inscritos.jpg)\n\n**Where Subscribers Come From:  \n**\n\n**\\*Subtitles:**  \n**Pagina de exibição do youtube = youtube watch page**  \n**Feed dos shorts = shorts feed**  \n**Seu canal do youtube=your youtube channel**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/4V7hFgj/de-onde-vem-os-inscritos.jpg)\n\n**Age range of viewers:**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/hCtzsrR/Idade-Audiencia-porcentagem.jpg)\n\n**Gender:  \n\\*Subtitles:  \nFeminino = Female  \nMasculino = Male**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/C9xB4RN/genero.jpg)\n\n**Devices:  \n\\*Subtitles:  \nComputador = PC or notebook  \nDispositivel móvel = Mobile  \nTablet = Tablet  \nTV = TV**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7XjLW8N/Dispositivos.jpg)\n\n**We have a strong community in telegram too more 200 msngs day:**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/s6d0gBK/Com-verbo.jpg)\n\n**Twitter:**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CnFv0Cz/twitter-verbo.jpg)\n\n**About US:**\n\n**Our Portfolio:**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186R9xgXZbGvsKT1\\_GYgR4ir1lc7Dnr\\_JnCdI3nbgeUE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/186R9xgXZbGvsKT1_GYgR4ir1lc7Dnr_JnCdI3nbgeUE/edit?usp=sharing) - This portfolio got funded by Wagmedia\n\n**![](https://i.ibb.co/DQV6LvL/johnrhodelbartolome.jpg)**\n\n**John Rhodel Bartolome** - AKA \"Parachainboy\" - Founder Verbo da Sabedoria, Polkadot Senior Ambassador for Brazil, Ambassador of parachains such as: Phala, Oak, Bifrost, Moonbeam, Integritee, Nodle, Crust and Aleph Zero, Content creator, rookie member Polkadot Heroes, director of the Filipino unit at Wagmedia, software engineer, and also with experience producing Polkadot events in Brazil, Blockchain SP, View Party Decoded Curitiba and Blockchain Rio.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0j8xHkX/p-VMwct4v-400x400.jpg)\n\n**Gabriel Bonugli** - AKA \"Gabekoin\" - Polkadot/Kusama Senior Ambassador / Ambassador: Phala, OAK and Polimec also have been contributing as Community Manager, Content Creator, Writer, Translator, member of Kusamigos, marketing specialist and also with experience producing Polkadot events in Brazil, View Party Decoded Curitiba and Blockchain Rio.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/kB95MpD/Cejota.jpg)\n\n**Carlos Sawaki (CJ)** - I've been studying the markets for 5 years and crypto for almost 3, with some courses also taken in the area.

For instance, staking rewards can be taxable at the moment of payout, based on the value of the reward in fiat.\n\nTo easily display staking rewards in fiat currency, I created [https://polkatax.com/](https://polkatax.com/)\n\nOn the website, you can find and export staking rewards for several substrate chains in your favorite fiat currency.\n\nThe project is open source: [https://shorturl.at/qBOZ9](https://shorturl.at/qBOZ9)\n\nIf you find [https://polkatax.com/](https://polkatax.com/) useful, please consider supporting this proposal.\n\nWarning: The application hasn't been extensively tested by a large number of users yet, so I recommend verifying the results for accuracy. If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://shorturl.at/qBOZ9).\n\nIf many people find this website helpful, I plan to implement a function to find and export token rewards for lending, providing liquidity, and airdrops as well.",

You can listen to it here (in Finnish):\n\nhttps://spotify.link/VqfVZyASVBb\n\nThis was the first time ever that Polkadot is discussed in any Finnish media. Based on the feedback received, it will not be the last one. The hosts would like to do a follow up episode, delving deeper into Polkadot DeFi. I'll be sure not to do that interview alone.\n\n**Time investment**\n\nAlthough the groundwork has taken months, the preparation for this podcast specifically was about eight hours and the recording itself about two hours. In reality, I've used much more time. See, this is my first ever OpenGov proposal and the second time I try. **First time failed because I chose a wrong preimage.** I want to do this right so I can confidently instruct others how to submit proposers later on.\n\n**Tip**\n\nThe tip that I’m asking for is for 10 hours of work, 5 DOT per hour, **50 DOT in total**.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nPolkadot community activation from scratch is an arduous process. On our journey to futher 'human decentralization', tips for those who represent Polkadot in the media and initiate the conversations should function as incentives, at least before the on-chain Ambassadors Collective is in full steam.\n\n**Please vote Aye** to show that all this learning through trial and error matters.",

      "content": "**\\[THIS IS GOING TO FAIL ANYWAYS, NO MATTER WHAT YOU VOTE. CHOSE A WRONG PRE-IMAGE.\\]**\n\n**Background**\n\nI am the only Polkadot Ambassador in Finland, so far. I have been working to establish the basis for a local community here, completely on a voluntary basis. As part of that slow but steady progress, I found organisers for one of the four European Polkadot Decoded Viewing Parties. I have also created connections to reliable crypto influencers and citizen journalists. This is my first ever OpenGov proposal, aiming to learn the ropes so I can teach others later. (I know the pre-image was wrongly selected but I'm here to make mistakes so others don't have to).\n\n**Hopium Podcast**\n\nHopium is a Finnish language podcast about crypto and blockchain, available on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/0hrjC7sYtO3LicrLxyvF6H) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@hopium_fi4774). It is a citizen journalism initiative outside of our \"Dotsama bubble\". I was invited to talk about Polkadot in their 44th episode. This was the first time ever that Polkadot is discussed in any Finnish media. Based on the feedback received, it will not be the last one. The hosts would like to do a follow up episode, delving deeper into Polkadot DeFi.\n\n**Time investment**\n\nAlthough the groundwork has taken months, the preparation for this podcast specifically was about eight hours and the recording itself about two hours.\n\n**Tip**\n\nThe tip that I’m asking for is for 10 hours of work, 10 DOT per hour, 100 DOT in total.\n\n**Reasoning**\n\nOn our journey to futher 'human decentralization', tips for those who represent Polkadot in the media should function as incentives, at least before Ambassadors collective is in full steam.\n\nPlease vote and comment below. Glad to get any feedback and ideas.",

The Dapp is a goofmachine that then changes/goofes the pfp according to the amount of votes a user made. By this it leverages the existing NFT communities inside the Polkadot ecosystem to visualise the participation of their members in the Polkadot governance.\n\nHow? \n\nVoters can upload their favourite pfp to a Dapp. \nThe Dapp tracks and takes in to account the amount of votes and according to the votes it goofes -> changes the pfp. I.e. 10 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp slightly, 50 votes changes it more, 100 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp drastically. \nThe pfp’s are interpreted and changed by a trained AI. The AI uses re-occuring features that are recognizable in other goofed NFT’s.\n\n**PART 2: Incentivising voting**\n\nEach goofed NFT holders participates automatically in a raffle. The winners of the raffle are rewarded with benefits such as:\n\n- Being invited to a Polkadot Decoded event, flight & hotel costs are covered by the GovernGoofed treasury.\n- The winners can spend x amount of DOT supporting a Dotsama project such as [Teddie Dao](https://teddydao.org/) or any other project.\n- Other options to be explored\n\nSo in essence the benefits by voting will be real, but they increase the participation of the voters in the ecosystem rather than voters being financially rewarded.\n\n**PART 3: Educational**\n\nGovernGoofed is a media platform that educates about the current running proposals by giving a stage to proposers and voters. \nIt uses known channels such as YT, Twitter, Discord etc. to give a voice to proposers in order to give insight in their proposal.\n\nA full visual presentation of the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13in-4Ww4zAkKsBrzbW9THkXEgBQLyM00Bwo3JDNb1oM/edit?usp=sharing).",

I.e. 10 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp slightly, 50 votes changes it more, 100 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp drastically. \nThe pfp’s are interpreted and changed by a trained AI. The AI uses re-occuring features that are recognizable in other goofed NFT’s.\n\n**PART 2: Incentivising voting**\n\nEach goofed NFT holders participates automatically in a raffle. The winners of the raffle are rewarded with benefits such as:\n\n- Being invited to a Polkadot Decoded event, flight & hotel costs are covered by the GovernGoofed treasury.\n- The winners can spend x amount of DOT supporting a Dotsama project such as Teddie Dao or any other project.\n- Other options to be explored\n\nSo in essence the benefits by voting will be real, but they increase the participation of the voters in the ecosystem rather than voters being financially rewarded.\n\n**PART 3: Educational**\n\nGovernGoofed is a media platform that educates about the current running proposals by giving a stage to proposers and voters. \nIt uses known channels such as YT, Twitter, Discord etc. to give a voice to proposers to give insight in their proposal.\n\nA full visual presentation of the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13in-4Ww4zAkKsBrzbW9THkXEgBQLyM00Bwo3JDNb1oM/edit?usp=sharing).",

          "content": "**GovernGoofed**\n\n> If validators are the beating heart of Polkadot, governance is the brain that keeps it healthy.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nA small tipper proposal to research the scope of a project called GovernGoofed and attracted contributors. GovernGoofed wants to offer a solution to 3 of the most challenging aspects of **OpenGov1:** **partcipation, rewards, education.**\n\nThis proposal has 3 goals:\n\n- Explain the scope of the GovernGoofed project.\n- Research the cost and ideal approach.\n- Attract contributors for the project.\n\n\n**Proposer**\n\nOkAlice, is a young dev agency that works and builds exclusively in the Polkadot ecosystem since mid 2022. Two out of four of our core team member will be enrolling in the next PBA in Berkeley next week. [@snow_mead](https://twitter.com/snow_mead) , [@DagieDee](https://twitter.com/DagieDee)\n\nOne core team member works at parity and has an advisory roll: [@kodeist](https://twitter.com/kodeist)\n\n\n> What is GovernGoofed?\n\n**Problem**\n\nThere’s a lack of participation in the governance and treasury proposals in the Dotsama ecosystem There’s no real incentive for Dot holders to vote on proposals There’s often little knowledge about proposals\n\n**Solution**\n\nMake the act of voting more visible and cool.\nIncentivise voting with non-financial rewards, so people vote for the right reason.\nCreate a tool/community that explains the most important proposals in a non-technical way\nHow?\n\nThe GovernGoofed solution consists out of 3 parts\n\n**PART 1: Making participation in voting visible and cool.**\n\nPart one of GovernGoofed is a Dapp where people can upload their favourite pfp. The Dapp is a goofmachine that then changes/goofes the pfp according to the amount of votes a user made. By this it leverages the existing NFT communities inside the Polkadot ecosystem to visualise the participation of their members in the Polkadot governance.\n\nHow? Voters can upload their favourite pfp to a Dapp. The Dapp tracks and takes in to account the amount of votes and according to the votes it goofes -> changes the pfp. I.e. 10 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp slightly, 50 votes changes it more, 100 votes ‘goofes’ the pfp drastically. The pfp’s are interpreted and changed by a trained AI. The AI uses re-occuring features that are recognizable in other goofed NFT’s.\n\n**PART 2: Incentivising voting**\n\nEach goofed NFT holders participates automatically in a raffle. The winners of the raffle are rewarded with benefits such as:\n\nBeing invited to a Polkadot Decoded event, flight & hotel costs are covered by the GovernGoofed treasury.\nThe winners can spend x amount of DOT supporting a Dotsama project such as Teddie Dao or any other project.\nOther options to be explored\nSo in essence the benefits by voting will be real, but they increase the participation of the voters in the ecosystem rather than voters being financially rewarded.\n\n**PART 3: Educational**\n\nGovernGoofed is a media platform that educates about the current running proposals by giving a stage to proposers and voters It uses known channels such as YT, Twitter, Discord etc. to give a voice to proposers to give insight in their proposal.\n\nA full visual presentation of the project can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13in-4Ww4zAkKsBrzbW9THkXEgBQLyM00Bwo3JDNb1oM/edit?usp=sharing).",

The educational videos will serve as valuable resources not only for newcomers to the blockchain space but also for experienced individuals seeking to deepen their understanding of DOTSAMA unique features and capabilities. I am looking forward on receiving your feedback over the next 7 days of the referendum. Kind regards, George",

          "content": "Dear Polkadot community! My name is George and I am a Dotsama enthusiast that is trying to share knowledge about the entire ecosystem through videos. For the past 1 year and a half, I have been deeply involved in the entire ecosystem, diligently following its progress, absorbing more and more information that at some point I wanted to share with the others. I started with translating articles in my native language on my medium page and I am still doing this, but I wanted also to start creating my own piece of content to share and spread the word. 4 months ago I started a YouTube channel and started to create educational videos by using animations. Personally I like this type of videos because with a very good script and by using animations as a captivating tool it is more easy to explain complex concepts and bring clarity to the viewers. You can check the videos created until now on my channel https://www.youtube.com/@AnimatedCrypto. Moreover, even though the channel is at the beginning I have received good feedback and people encouraged me to further expand my efforts and produce higher-quality content. However, in order to sustain and enhance the production value of my videos, I am seeking a small financial support from the Polkadot Treasury. The requested funds would be utilised in order to create 10 new educational videos. I would like to use my way of creating videos to present 10 parachains, from DOTSAMA, such as: Moonbeam, Astar, RMRK, Unique Network, Phala Network, Subsocial, Centrifuge, Parallel, Polkadex, Ajuna Network. Additionally I will create a educational thread on my twitter channel on each project in order to reach bigger audiences. The requested amount is 120 DOT , worth approximately $600 @ $5 per DOT at today's market price. By supporting my endeavour, you will contribute to the spread of knowledge and awareness about Polkadot, fostering its growth and adoption. The educational videos will serve as valuable resources not only for newcomers to the blockchain space but also for experienced individuals seeking to deepen their understanding of DOTSAMA unique features and capabilities.
