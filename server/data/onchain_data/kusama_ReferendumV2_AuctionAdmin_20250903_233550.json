      "content": "In light of recent developments, we have identified an issue pertaining to the recently executed [Referendum 320](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/320) and the Kusama auctions scheduled for 2024. Specifically, in Lease Period 37 (LP37), there is a discrepancy in the opening block number. While it was intended to be #22,118,400, the current representation reflects #21,118,400.\n\nTo rectify this issue promptly, this proposal involves the removal of LP37 from the current scheduler and the introduction of a fresh one, adhering to the initially planned start time. For more information about auctions in 2024 please make sure to review the following document [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BGjZlOdcj4Jmwn7AToByRVh54RW5s0Rpthj5M3jNoeY/edit#gid=1201445856).",

Given that the Root Track already has [a proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/101) being voted for the 2023 auctions schedule, this needs to be done first to ensure the right cadence of auctions in Kusama. For the community to understand: the first three auctions of the original schedule are voted via Auction Admin track: the rest is scheduled via referendum 101 (Root Track).\n\nThis proposal represents the last one (hopefully) on Auction Admin Track before the 2023 schedule (originally presented [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/72)) enacts and starts running. \n\n- Encoded call data: [0x480001e170](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x480001e170) \n- Parameters: `auctions.newAuction(duration: 14400, leasePeriodIndex: 28)`\n- Proposal hash: `0xb190ec6496ffc0b1daba06328043ffcc036d309b99a268092a59810da9c9ec12`\n\nNote: as this needs to happen before the root track call in [referendum 101](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/101), this auction for LP28 will have a duration of 14,400 blocks to give more space until the start of the root call to ensure things go well.\n\nMake sure to vote at your convenience!",

      "title": "Auction now (Auction Caller) - scheduling 1 auction to replace the first missed auction meant to be scheduled by referendum 72",
      "content": "Auctions on Kusama are scheduled using the Scheduler Pallet. [Referendum 72](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/72) was proposed on Kusama through root Track given that the Scheduler Pallet can’t be called by the Auctions Admin (this PR will change that). Due to voting turnout, Referendum 72 will not be executed before the first scheduled call, set to happen at block height #16_367_188. This means that the first batch of auctions for LP27 will not be executed, as the scheduler pallet does not allow the execution of an action in a past block (the other batches will be scheduled).\n\nIn order to alleviate the demand of auctions (teams that need to renovate their slot during LP27 to keep uptime of their parachains will not be able to do so, therefore having to interrupt their service to the community) we have proposed the following two referenda, up for vote now and scheduling 3 auctions from next week:\n\nThis referendum aims to schedule **the first auction creation call** but through **auction admin track** without using the scheduler. The auction will be triggered shortly after approval. Max Target Block is the latest this can be submitted given the support it can have. If submitted today (27/Jan), then it will need at least a support of 3.85% for this solution to work. \n\n(The other two auctions are aimed to be scheduled by [this proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/81)) - up for vote as well.\n\n**Call**\n\n- Auction: Auction Admin\n\n- Parameters: `auctions.newAuction(duration: 14400, leasePeriodIndex: 27)`\n\n- Encoded call Data: [0x480001e16c](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x480001e16c) ",
