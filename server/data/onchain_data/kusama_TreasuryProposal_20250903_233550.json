      "title": "Stage 2: Drive massive adoption with the first 20,000 physical debit cards for LatAm people led by kusama (new 20,000 holders over 1 year)",
      "content": "## Objective\n\nBloque aims to make Kusama the leading network for debit card issuance worldwide, starting in LatAm. Our success metric result for this project is $10M in monthly volume on Asset Hub. We have the network, the team, the metrics—and your trust.\n\n## We are a trusted team\n\nOur team we have shipped before the [#499](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/499) 30% faster with 20% more total payment volume in asset hub [(+$528K USD vs $440K USD )](https://assethub-kusama.subscan.io/account/CzQea4LtW8YWgwgYRMeRi64FgK2YVnWDGQkxa9SxcqPRq7W?tab=asset_change)\n\n\n## Summary proposal.\n\n**Bloque** has  launched an  open developer platform to issue layer 1 VISA  debit  cards on Kusama Asset Hub.\n\nThe requested funding allows us to build on the technical foundation to issue and distribute 20,000 physical debit cards over <ins>1 year</ins> to 20,000 new and KYC’d Kusama account holders. These new cards have its own account in Asset-hub and can spend KSM, dUSD and native tokens at any point of sale. instantly.\n\nThese new users will be onboarded through  trusted partners including: fintech platforms, construction companies, e-commerce merchants and street sellers throughout LatAm. \n\nWe project an average spend per card of $149 - $500 per month creating a monthly volume of $3.6M to $10m, we already moved ~~$440K~~ $528K USD on-chain in AH. (Why 500 USD, check the FAQ below)\n\nThis will generate 0.2% fees on every transaction for Kusama - $7.2K - $20k per month. \n\nFor developers you can issue debit cards to your users and earn up to 1.2% on every purchase they make. It’s a cost-effective, compliant, and growth aligned  way to boost your revenue while delivering real value to your community.\n\n## Why Kusama?\n\n- Kusama its a production ready blockchain underuse that is 8.22x cheaper:\n\n**Pure Proxy:** Kusama(0.0068 KSM) ~= 0.0941 USD vs Polkadot(0.2 DOT) > ~0.7 USD\n- Kusama receives faster upgrades, we benefit sooner from performance, security, scalability and Governance.\n- We made the first Kusama/Polkadot Meetup in LatAm in my previous startup Valiu, in 2020, i'm a true believer.\n\n## KYC/KYB Not required for DAOS\n\nWe’re building a legal framework that lets communities and individuals use debit cards without exposing personal identity. Our KYT‑driven compliance program reduces AML risks and allows DAOs and their members to access the traditional financial system while preserving privacy.\n\n## ZK Approach\n\nWe aim to enable ZK proofs in a later phase. Our manufacturer supports loading Java applets onto the card, enabling on‑card cryptography. We’re evaluating how to leverage this for privacy‑preserving verification, once we got confirmation we can share a plan with the community.\n\n## Demo\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/qqLcFk8k/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-1-59-54-PM.png)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/mrfdBTdszSk)\n\n## AGG presentation\n[![](https://i.postimg.cc/yY1kPhW4/Screenshot-2025-07-24-at-1-51-15-PM.png)](https://x.com/TheKusamarian/status/1948171274305544209)\n[Link to slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zwY2wvwEJe74sSJnKGwI46vBdeIumZody3Tax6VNyY0/edit?slide=id.g3634ddf2cff_0_102#slide=id.g3634ddf2cff_0_102)\n\n## TL; DR;\n\n**Our team:**\n\n- Founding team from YCombinator.\n-  $2.5m USD Total Payment Volume to date.\n- +$400k USD on moved on Kusama AH currently.\n- Delivered the [#499 30% faster](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/499).\n\n**Proposal:**\n-  Expected $3.6 - $10m USD monthly volume in AH through 20,000 holders spending +$149-$500 per month. \n- Our north-star success metric is $10M USD in monthly volume.\n- 0.2% Transaction fees to Kusama (either burned or $7.2-$20k USD per month to treasury) \n- buy pressure with 0.1% purchase per debit card transaction in KSM for fees.\n- Developers can earn up to 1.2% of transaction fees by launching their own branded cards \n- Opportunity for branding on the card, which lead awareness of kusama. \n- Costs are for purchasing debit cards and for developer time.\n- Risk shared by Bloque team who are covering their own overhead (~$134K USD paid by Bloque,  $179K paid by Kusama).\n\n## Costs:\n\n#### Physical Card  Costs (107,707 USD) paid by Kusama : 60.1% of total Amount.\n- **Price per card:**3.04 USD x 20,000 = +60,800 USD [(You can check it in our contract here)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z2tmUvMkL-3Te4HhPEyCPBZG719KTgpA/view)\n-** Embossing fee:**+4,500 USD\n- **Colombian VAT:** 19% = 0.19  * (60,800 USD + 4,500 USD) = +12,407 USD\n- **Additional Visa Collateral:** +30K USD extra collateral for Visa processing transactions ahead of settlement. (Global)\n\n #### Engineering Time Costs (72,000 USD) paid by Kusama: 39.9% Total Amount.\n- **Team Composition:** The project will employ 2 full-time mid engineers, to improve concurrency, security and UX/UI for the debit card platform.\n- **Monthly Cost:** Each member incurs a cost of 3K USD per month.\n- **Project Duration:** The team will work full-time for a period of 12 months.\n- Multiplying the monthly cost by the number of team members and the duration (3K USD x 2 members x 12 months).\n\n#### Operative team (Compliance, head finance, Infrastructure) paid by Bloque: ~134,760 USD\n- **Team composition:** Head of Sales, Compliance Officer & Head of Financial operations + devops and Infrastructure. \n- **Monthly costs:** 11.230,51 USD\n- **Duration:** 12 Months\n\n## Resources\n- [Full proposal document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EKVbKmIPMnd0M52wUYr2VRd3un7hXfe8rozCU6PRY2M/edit?usp=sharing)\n- API docs: [Authentication + Holder Creation](https://api.bloque.app/docs/origins), [Transactional Ledger](https://api.bloque.app/docs/ledger), [Card issuance](https://api.bloque.app/docs/mediums).\n\n## FAQ\n**Which regions are supported?** Mainly LatAm starting in Colombia & Mexico with worldwide availability via Passport.\n\n**How will this API handle key material since the wallets are non-custodial?**\nWe use a combination of proxy accounts with defined spending limits. In addition, the “debit callback” endpoint with 3D Secure prompts users to authorize (i.e., sign) transactions—effectively meaning the user “sells” crypto to us so that we can complete the payment on their behalf. Our security model is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing: at setup, the holder sends us one part of the secret while keeping the other part secure across multiple devices. When a transaction is authorized, the two parts are combined to complete the transaction.\n\n**How are redemptions processed?**\nToday’s redemption channels include Brale Rails (conversion across 10+ chains to USDT/USDC), a DEX liquidity pool for KSM/dUSD, and direct debit card transactions.\n\n**Do day-to-day COP inflation swings pose a risk?**\nYes, they can. To mitigate this risk, we maintain only small COP buffers in the bank while holding most of our treasury in USD.\n\n**How will the system mitigate potential volatility given that settlement can take several days?**\nLimiting USD buffer sales to twice daily (e.g., morning and afternoon) may expose us to unexpected volatility. Ideally, we offload USD as frequently as market conditions allow. When that isn’t feasible, we rely on compensation accounts, short-term COP buffer loans, SWIFT transfers, and OTC channels to quickly convert USD into COP liquidity.\n\n**How would a chargeback or clawback be handled?**\nFor same-day chargebacks—such as paying $5 with KSM for an Uber ride and then canceling—the system applies an adjustment credit by deducting $5 from the USD buffer, converting it to KSM, and crediting your account. For delayed clawbacks—like purchasing a $20 card with KSM on Temu but receiving a faulty product—we detect the issue via Visa’s invoices and balance sheets. In the next payment cycle, we net the amounts between our accounts; for instance, if we owe Visa $100 but receive $20, we pay only $80, converting the extra $20 into KSM and crediting your account.\n\n**Why 20,000 cards instead of 10,000 or 5,000?**\nPomelo minimum order is 10K physical cards,  For the range of 10K or 20K, our operative costs are the same, the unit costs operative cost per card is lower for 20K cards, so its optimal for RoI.\n\nFor 20K Cards = (134,760 + 72,000)/20,000 cards =  ~$10 USD.\nFor 10K Cards = (134,760 + 72,000)/10,000 card = ~$20 USD.\n\n**Why $149 - $500 USD per card?**\n[Please check our volumes projection](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhy7ncYhbg5JCBA2FF4gWPu19VunMzIF_-nLyqIodq4/edit?gid=735485583#gid=735485583)",

There are now many more payouts per era as more validators are active and there is a higher drain on funds.\n\nIt is worthwhile noting that the account has [no outbound transfers](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Gch4VxQ79WhjgQqHomvJbqF3Woza5g5cYgM8SVQdDb9szz1?tab=transfer) and most (if not all) expenses on the account are transactional in nature; this means that 80% of the fees are returned to the treasury.\n\nThe account balance graph is shown below.\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV2o3v2mhfx3AeyX8HLrcrfLMZEFHwDnyxnBkSFqcSEQP)\n\nRegards,\nWill | Paradox | ParaNodes.io",

      "content": "KSM trading recently went live on Hydration after referendum #490 (https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/490) approved 33,333 KSM in Treasury LP. This has finally opened up liquidity flows between the two chains.\n\nWhen transfers are made between the two using the Kusama <> Polkadot bridge, if a user does not have sufficient KSM/ DOT (depending on the chain) on the receiving network then a portion of the asset they’re sending (e.g. KSM from KAH to PAH) is swapped for the native token to pay for fees. This is excellent UX and prevents user frustration with having to collect fees before bridging assets - however, unfortunately the current liquidity leaves much to be desired and as a result users can get rekt by slippage and lose much larger amounts of their assets to fees than expected.\n\nThis proposal, if approved, will supply 333 KSM to a 2/2 multisig with signers Leemo & lolmcshizz - which combined with referendum (https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1479) on Polkadot, will be split between Kusama AssetHub and Polkadot AssetHub 50/50 to provide a base level of liquidity on each network. This will ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for these small swaps and users will only pay the fees they are expecting to when making transfers.\n\nAny excess tokens will be returned to their respective treasuries.",

      "content": "Summary\n-------\n\nBloque offers an open API infrastructure that allows developers to easily integrate prepaid debit card functionality into their platforms, with balances securely stored on Kusama’s blockchain. Targeting financial exclusion in Latin America—where 25% of the population is unbanked—Bloque eliminates the costly barriers, regulatory challenges, and technical difficulties typically associated with issuing debit cards. Unlike standalone wallets, Bloque serves as infrastructure for businesses, enabling them to provide branded, non-custodial debit cards that users can load with stablecoins, use via mobile wallets or physical cards, and even withdraw cash worldwide. This approach not only promotes financial inclusion but also increases Kusama’s blockchain activity, as each transaction generates on-chain fees in KSM.  \n \n### We're different \n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/1w1JCRb/Bloque-Pitch-deck-6.png) \n\nTL; DR;\n-------\n\n[![](https://i.ibb.co/nMLC54XG/Screenshot-2025-02-17-at-15-15-39.png)](https://www.youtube.com/live/kBX1RXwROy8?si=G1T9ymPBgJIUZ7Tf&t=454)\n\n\nResources\n---------\n\n*   Full proposal [document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J98P2-shkrODJEnFinJkDoVEN-JviygWfIocRo7l7ag/edit?tab=t.0)\n*   [Website.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J98P2-shkrODJEnFinJkDoVEN-JviygWfIocRo7l7ag/edit?tab=t.0)\n*   First customer [Coco Wallet YCS19](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/coco-wallet) and [letter of intent for 450K and 3,500 Users.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yOyvpNZvc043MvF61o6oppkY9rJ0gsqB/view?usp=sharing)\n*   Contract with Visa & Pomelo to issue debit cards, bank statements, please request via DM in @david:bloque.team in Element.\n*   Preview [API Documentation.](https://api.bloque.app/docs/accounts)\n\n### How it works\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CKsh6Y4F/diagram-export-2-17-2025-2-58-28-PM.png)\n\n### Partners\n\n*   **Pomelo + Visa (Debit card issuer):** Pomelo is a pioneering fintech transforming card issuance in Latin America. Its cloud-native, API-driven platform lets banks and fintechs launch secure, scalable cards rapidly. Partnering with Mastercard and Coastal Community Bank, Pomelo modernizes payments and drives financial inclusion.\n*   **Truora (KYC/KYB):** Truora is a Latin American startup simplifying user verification and fraud prevention. Its API-driven platform offers background checks, digital identity, and KYC tools to help businesses onboard customers securely, reduce fraud, and boost conversion\n*   **Bancolombia (Our Bank):** Bancolombia is Colombia’s largest bank, boasting 146+ years of trusted service. With 30M+ customers, extensive branch and ATM networks, and innovative digital solutions, it drives financial inclusion, supports sustainable growth, and champions economic progress across Latin America.\n\n### Meet our first customer\n\n[![](https://i.ibb.co/sd0gp7sF/Screenshot-2025-02-25-at-17-02-55.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzP1vXJq7zQ&t=2714s&ab_channel=TheKus)\n\nwe introduced CocoWallet, building on the success of [CocoMercado](https://www.cocomercado.com/landing/), a remittance-based food service that’s supported Venezuela’s elderly through 7,000,000 expats. Now, CocoWallet is tackling financial exclusion in Colombia by launching debit cards with Bloque for the unbanked—and we’re bringing this to Kusama.\n\nOur goal is to onboard 3,000+ unbanked Colombians in the next few months. Here’s how we’ll do it on Kusama:\n\n*   **Decentralized Design:** Funds will be held in non-custodial wallets on Kusama’s Asset-Hub, with all debit card transactions pay fees in KSM. No banks, no centralized control—just user-owned value.\n*   **Kusama Benefits:** These 3,000 new users will become KSM holders, boosting adoption. Each card swipe will generate on-chain micro-transactions, increasing network activity and rewarding validators.\n*   **Scalability:** After this pilot, we’ll scale to 10,000 users across Latin America by 2025, funded by transaction fees but no endless treasury asks. Banks are obsolete. We want to drive a transformation that enables every organization to provide financial services—starting with a debit card. We aim to free finances for people, and to do this, we need your support.\n\nFAQ\n===\n\n*   **Why funding us?** We are an experienced team with a proven record of building Web3 products. Now, we want to use Kusama in everyday cases worldwide.\n    \n*   **Which regions are supported?** Mainly LatAm starting in Colombia & Mexico with worldwide availability via Passport.\n    \n*   **How will this API handle key material since the wallets are non-custodial?**  \n    We use a combination of proxy accounts with defined spending limits. In addition, the “debit callback” endpoint with 3D Secure prompts users to authorize (i.e., sign) transactions—effectively meaning the user “sells” crypto to us so that we can complete the payment on their behalf. Our security model is based on Shamir’s Secret Sharing: at setup, the holder sends us one part of the secret while keeping the other part secure across multiple devices. When a transaction is authorized, the two parts are combined to complete the transaction.\n    \n*   **How are redemptions processed?**  \n    Today’s redemption channels include Brale Rails (conversion across 10+ chains to USDT/USDC), a DEX liquidity pool for KSM/dUSD, and direct debit card transactions.\n    \n*   **Do day-to-day COP inflation swings pose a risk?**  \n    Yes, they can. To mitigate this risk, we maintain only small COP buffers in the bank while holding most of our treasury in USD.\n    \n*   **How will the system mitigate potential volatility given that settlement can take several days?**  \n    Limiting USD buffer sales to twice daily (e.g., morning and afternoon) may expose us to unexpected volatility. Ideally, we offload USD as frequently as market conditions allow. When that isn’t feasible, we rely on compensation accounts, short-term COP buffer loans, SWIFT transfers, and OTC channels to quickly convert USD into COP liquidity.\n    \n*   **How would a chargeback or clawback be handled?**  \n    **_For same-day chargebacks_**—such as paying $5 with KSM for an Uber ride and then canceling—the system applies an adjustment credit by deducting $5 from the USD buffer, converting it to KSM, and crediting your account. **_For delayed clawbacks_**—like purchasing a $20 card with KSM on Temu but receiving a faulty product—we detect the issue via Visa’s invoices and balance sheets. In the next payment cycle, we net the amounts between our accounts; for instance, if we owe Visa $100 but receive $20, we pay only $80, converting the extra $20 into KSM and crediting your account.\n    \n*   **Whats the relationship with Virto?** BloqueDAO is a Virto-spinoff established as a self-governing DAO in Kreivo. We’re leveraging on the Kreivo technology to support non-custodial management of the funds every user tops-up in their Kusama Pay cards.",

The funds remain under the control of the Kusama Protocol and OpenGov after successfully launching KSM trading on Hydration.\n\n**Please read the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZnqrjTAQsZXVZpJk8tUQ6G-XsSwgsOUtwji_cn0nk0/edit?usp=sharing).**\n\n# Summary\nThe goal of this proposal is to contribute towards building an accessible, deep layer of native liquidity on Polkadot and connecting that with Kusama - encouraging value flows between the sister chains without the need for a centralised intermediary.\n\nIf approved, this proposal will provide 33,333 KSM from the Kusama Treasury into the Hydration Omnipool - after KSM is launched for swaps on Hydration, the liquidity position will remain under the control of the Kusama Protocol and OpenGov.\n\nThe requested KSM would be added to the Omnipool as single-sided liquidity, in the same way that [1,000,000 DOT were added through ref #560](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/560) - this would be the most liquid trading venue for KSM on Polkadot and finally provide a simple and trustless way to move value between Polkadot and Kusama. No more hops on CEX required to make the move!\n",

It also has the largest TVL for liquid staked DOT (vDOT) with over 7.5M DOT ($45M). Bifrost has liquid staking solutions for other networks such as Kusama (vKSM), Astar (vASTR), Ethereum (vETH), Manta (vMANTA), and Moonbeam (vGLMR).\n\n> This proposal would request the Kusama treasury to lend a total of 50,000 KSM (repaid with interest) for 18 months as base liquidity for the KSM and vKSM (liquid staking token for KSM) pair in Bifrost Stable Swap.\n> \n\nThis proposal is identical to **our last two successful proposals in 2022 and 2023**- for reference below:\n\n- 2022: https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606\n    - The execution timeline of the proposal: https://kusama.subscan.io/treasury/177\n- 2023: https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/236\n    - The execution timeline of the proposal: https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/236?tab=timeline\n- Bifrost has brought a **total income of 8,370.5523 KSM** to the Kusama Treasury. (check more details at the next section “Bringing Substantial Income to the Kusama Treasury”)\n\nThe repayment of last year's liquidity loan will occur in **Nov 2024** (15 months after receiving the loan in 2023).\n\nIn terms of Repayment details:\n\n9/27 | Withdraw vKSM/KSM liquidity from Bifrost Stablepool. ([Executed](https://bifrost-kusama.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/114))\n\n10/25 | Initiate Bifrost referendum proposal to redeem borrowed vKSM + 15 months interest. ([Executed](https://bifrost-kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/60))\n\n11/19 | Transfer total **54,625.0495** of KSM ( 50,000 KSM from initial principal + **4,625.0495** KSM from staking rewards of 25,000 KSM in 15 months) back to Kusama Treasury. ([Executed](https://bifrost-kusama.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/135)) \n\n# Why Bifrost?\n\nThis Initial liquidity subsidy is fundamental in keeping sufficient liquidity for vKSM and enabling more support for broader use-cases across the ecosystem particularly Polkadot (**DOT <> KSM bridge will be supported soon**).\n\nThe renewal of this liquidity loan would ensure the continuity of benefits achieved from our previous proposals for the broader Kusama ecosystem and community (below are **comparisons between last few years’ proposal and presents in terms of achievements and present developments**):\n\n### Bringing Substantial Income to the Kusama Treasury\n\nDuring Bifrost's use of the KSM subsidy, we continuously channeled additional income to the Kusama Treasury:\n\n- 2023: [Repayment 53,745.5028 KSM](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29?tab=xcm_transfer),\n    - with **3,745.5028 KSM Interest**.\n- 2024: [Repayment 54,625.0495 KSM](https://bifrost-kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/65),\n    - with **4,625.0495 KSM Interest**.\n\nBifrost has brought a **total income of 8,370.5523 KSM** to the Kusama Treasury.\n\n### Unique Use cases for liquid staking\n\nIn 2024, we added the following important features to vKSM to help KSM users retain governance power while maximizing the benefits of liquid staking:\n\n**LST Governance Capacity Inheritance (GCI)**\n\n[vKSM Voting](https://app.bifrost.io/vstaking/vKSM?tab=governance) is one of the unique features of Bifrost LST, which reserves the right for **Bifrost LST holders to participate in its original on-chain governance**. \n\nRead more details at [here](https://docs.bifrost.io/quick-start-and-tutorials/lst-governance-capacity-inheritance-gci).\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUNBG6biohmqBjAfZ2FbqFBKYgRLVmXuqZ4BXK5vNXM1F)\n\n**Leveraged Staking** ([LoopStake](https://app.bifrost.io/vstaking/vKSM?tab=loopstake))\n\nLoopstake refers to the strategy of amplifying yield earned from staking by leveraging vKSM against KSM, it can also be called Leveraged Staking. This approach allows KSM users to potentially earn higher staking rewards than they would with just their own funds.\n\nRead more details at [here](https://docs.bifrost.io/builders/loopstake).\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTE2bEhsGJdNcQhqd348YZHoj3JHHb9HKo5iBRP3wFboC)\n\n**Chain Abstraction for KSM liquid staking**\n\nBifrost SLPx streamlined the complex process of bridging funds to destination chain, allowing users to liquid stake on any chain without leaving UI to interact with bridges. The ultimate goal of SLPx is to allow users and developers to effortlessly use or integrate Bifrost LSTs on any chain.\n\nRead more details at [here](https://docs.bifrost.io/builders/liquid-staking-x-slpx/overview).\n\n# **Motivation**\n\nAs our original intention stated in our first proposal remains unchanged, Bifrosts long-term goal is underpinned by the following objectives:\n\n- **Facilitate Capital Flow of KSM staking**\n\nKSM, as the governance token of Kusama, about 53% of the total amount of KSM is currently in staking. **Bifrost hopes to activate the capital utilization of staked KSM while empowering the security of the Relay-chain consensus, and promote the activity of Kusama Staking.** Thus, Bifrost has enhanced [its liquidity staking solution](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/tree/develop/pallets/slp) with XCM V5 for Staking KSM: vKSM, a liquid staking token that is anchored 1:1 with staked KSM and comes with KSM staking income. Bifrost hopes to borrow 50,000 KSM from the Kusama Treasury as the base liquidity.\n\n- **Empowering KSM staking across Kusama and Polkadot**\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Bifrost is expected to support bi-directional cross-chain between Kusama and Polkadot. Bifrost SLPx—a Bifrost chain abstraction protocol—will connect to Bridge Hub and package XCM cross-chain messages, ultimately enabling **one-click minting of vKSM on Bifrost-Polkadot**.\n\nThis development brings two major advantages: firstly, it provides Polkadot users with more LST options; secondly, not only vKSM, but more Parachain Staking assets can be transferred to Bifrost-Polkadot via SLPx. \n\n- **Enhance the consensus security of Kusama network and reduce the threshold for users to participate in staking**\n\nBifrost achieves decentralization and an alpha user experience for vKSM through the following aspects:\n\n**Decentralized staking process**:\n\nBifrost uses keyless sovereign-derived addresses to execute remote staking via XCM, ensuring the staking process is completely decentralized. For details on how this works, check [here](https://www.notion.so/bifrost-io/Verification-of-Bifrost-KSM-Staking-Addresses-119bc3b88a8480a7afccce71183f1a1c#119bc3b88a84801798dee3962e63ff88).\n\n**Validator Diversification**:\n\nCurrently, vKSM engages [120](https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM?tab=validators) validators in the relay chain, with an average of 24 validators for each delegator. All these validators are selected through Bifrost's dual-selection model outlined below.\n\n**Dual-model validator selection**:\n\nBifrost employs **opengov + automatic scoring** for validator selection, enhancing diversity, efficiency, and transparency. Validators are divided into Validator White List (VWL) and Validator Boost List (VBL). VWL is generated by a rating algorithm, while VBL is formed through independent node applications and community voting. SLP only entrusts user assets to these listed validators.\n\nVBL Discussions: https://bifrost-kusama.subsquare.io/discussions\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYv8U14Hnz8CJG1YfHgBajADt5aPgXMmKrctitgzhks6f)\n\n## vKSM utility “implementation plan”\n\n### Application scenarios\n\nLeverage vKSM use cases on **Polkadot**.\n\nOnce KSM <> DOT bridge is live, Bifrost plans to expand vKSM applications on Polkadot. This initiative will utilize Interlay Value, Hydradex omnipool, and DCA strategies, mirroring the successful approach implemented with vDOT. \n\n- To illustrate, one of Interlay's vDOT vaults has secured 48,801 DOT as collateral. Investors in this vault are currently benefiting from a substantial combined yield of 37.26% APR, comprising 21.12% vault APR and 16.14% vDOT APR. This advantageous model is anticipated to be applicable to vKSM in future implementations.\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNNscz2EGxfrCj7q94CNFrEHoprZ2HUx4dAdZUEEV49Pa)\n\nAbstract away KSM liquid staking to the multichain.\n\nCase Study: [omni.ls](http://omni.ls) \n\n- vKSM is currently supported on Kusama and Moonriver. It will be further supported for minting across Ethereum, Base, Astar, Moonbeam, Manta Pacific, and other networks via Bifrost SLPx. In our long-term multichain development roadmap, vKSM will be one of the key assets to build SLPx builder community across different ecosystems.\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYDWuQaxYm8FXEd4TwQa7GLcDh8nyjVENiBM2RUZ5okLm)\n\nBy leveraging the live DOT <> KSM bridge, we will drive more use cases for vKSM on Polkadot:\n\n- Support vKSM Loopstake on Bifrost-Polkadot.\n- Enable vKSM for purchasing Kusama coretime via Hydration Omnipool liquidity.\n- Enable vKSM to be used for transaction fee paying on Bifrost.\n\nNext steps:\n\n- Test and live DOT <> KSM Bridge, adapt the staking pallet migration from Relay-chain to AssetHub.\n- Register vKSM on Bifrost-Polkadot, enable SLPx supports vKSM minting on Bifrost-Polkadot.\n- Adapt vKSM in LoopStake.\n- Bridge vKSM-KSM liquidity to Bifrost-Polkadot.\n- Establish vKSM-KSM liquidity on Bifrost-Polkadot.\n- Register vKSM in Hydration, migrate 50%-80% vKSM-KSM liquidity to Hydration Omnipool and start joint-incetivization campaign.\n- Focus on expanding vKSM use cases through the SLPx strategy across more EVM-compatible chains and Layer 2 networks, in line with Bifrost's long-term roadmap: [Omni-chain LST Expansion Territory](https://www.notion.so/Bifrost-Roadmap-ba6c44bd4f684e5aa875ec44388b2330?pvs=21).\n\n# Proposal\n\n**Amount**:\n\nWe apply to borrow **50,000 KSM** liquidity subsidy from the Kusama Treasury for **18 months**.\n\n**Liquidity subsidy**:\n\nFor a detailed description, please see the section “Liquidity Loan and Repayment Process” below.\n\n## On-chain instruments used to provide liquidity to this proposal\n\n1. **Bifrost Stable Swap** This is designed to facilitate related exchanges between Bifrost liquid staking tokens “vTokens” and Token that are expected to have similar values, such as vDOT-DOT, vETH-ETH, vKSM-KSM, etc.\n\nWhy **Bifrost Stable Swap**?\n\n- As Bifrost liquid staking tokens “vToken” is a yield-bearing token, its value will gradually increase over time compared to the corresponding Token value. Therefore, the liquidity supply anchor of vToken and Token in AMM should change with the vToken exchange rate to avoid loss for liquidity providers. The following is a comparison between **pegged stable swap** and **Correlated stable swap**\n    - Pegged Stable Swap\n        \n        Tokens that swap near 1:1, such as two stablecoins of the same currency\n        \n    - **Correlated stable swap**\n        \n        Tokens that swap near 1: ***R*** with some slowly changing exchange rate ***R***, like vToken (eg: vDOT, DOT)\n        \n\nAdditional Information\n\nDocs: https://docs.bifrost.io/quick-start-and-tutorials/lst-stable-swap\n\nDapp: https://app.bifrost.io/swap?tab=pool\n\n2. **Hydration Omnipool** The Hydration Omnipool is an innovative type of Automated Market Maker (AMM) that concentrates all liquidity in a single trading pool. This design is intended to unlock new possibilities in the DeFi space.\n\nWhy **Hydration Omnipool?**\n\n- Hydration, the largest DEX across Polkadot with over $4.5M TVL, offers the best trading experience in the Polkadot ecosystem from several angles:\n    - Omnipool: It allows users to trade against native asset or non-native asset, under a concentrated liquidity pool.\n    - Single Token liquidity Mining: Users no longer need to calculate the required amount of bilateral liquidity in advance as before; they can simply add unilateral liquidity to the Omnipool.\n    - Yield DCA: Hydration's Omnipool and DCA Trading are able to fulfill the exchange and automated trading needs between vKSM and any Token with ultra-low slippage.\n    - Incoming features around Money Market and Stable Coin base on Omnipool.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nDocs: https://docs.hydration.net/\n\nDapp: https://app.hydration.net/ \n\nX: https://twitter.com/hydration_net\n\n# Managing the funds and Repayment process\n\nTracking Borrowing and Repayment Process\n\nBifrost will complete the borrowing/repayment process of the 50,000 KSM subsidy through a fully open and transparent process on Kusama and Bifrost governance.\n\n**Borrowing Process**\n\n- Kusama side\n1. Apply to Kusama treasury to borrow 50,000 KSM to the ParaId2001 (F7fq1jMmNj5j2jAHcBxgM26JzUn2N4duXu1U4UZNdkfZEPV) beneficiary through the (Treasury::propose_spend) method of the treasury module on Kusama.\n- Bifrost side\n1. Generate Bifrost treasury derived address via Utility::derivative_account_id method;\n2. Through the Tokens::set_balance method, an additional 50,000 KSM will be issued on Bifrost treasury derived address;\n3. Transfer 50,000 KSM from Bifrost treasury derived address to the treasury (eCSrvbA5gGNYdM3UjBNxcBNBqGxtz3SEEfydKragtL4pJ4F) address via the Tokens::force_transfer method;\n4. Mint 25,000 KSM into about 25,000 vKSM via VtokenMinting::mint method;\n5. Add 25,000 KSM and corresponding vKSM liquidity to Bifrost Stable Swap.\n- Additional\n1. In the actual transaction, steps 4 and 5 need to be called through the utility.dispatchAs method.\n2. In the actual transaction, steps 1-5 need to be packaged into one transaction through utility.batchAll.\n\n**Repayment process**\n\n- Bifrost side\n1. Remove liquidity from DEXs, retrieve the liquidity of the KSM-vKSM trading pair to the treasury account;\n2. By calling the VtokenMinting::redeem method, vKSM will be converted back to more than 25,000 KSM with 18 months staking rewards;\n3. Initiate a proposal on Kusama to repay an estimated 55,437 KSM to the Treasury: Transfer approximately 55,437 KSM (equivalent to one year's staking rewards of 25,000 KSM at an estimated 14.5% APR) from Bifrost Treasury to Kusama Treasury via XCM;",

Virto's DAO system provides this by offering tools for shared decision-making, clear record-keeping, and easy access to global financial services. This blockchain-based system helps groups make choices together, automate tasks, and use different types of money. It allows organizations to work better in a world that is becoming more connected and less centralized.\n\n## Demo\n\n[![virto app](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWLCnooSTpsLpN4HKyhuWKigp7f7m5wJGCbxPzyZ4571K)](https://www.loom.com/share/0f722d298377415ebd4b460aefd4d6e0?sid=4d0cdad0-2e2b-4587-a5c3-6011020989fe)\n\n### What to expect?\n\n- Our focus for Q3 is to offer a polished end-user experience for members of DAOs to easily manage and participated in their organizations without the need for wallets or fees thanks to the abstractions built on the Kreivo parachain.\n\n> ## Call to action for Kusama and Polkadot\n>\n>We’re running a MVP program with on/off ramps providers in the Americas region to empower our organizations with digital debit cards to manage their expenses online and on/off ramps from KSM/DOT to USD in US and Colombian Pesos to pay salaries or perform deals with tranditional entities in the Region.\n>\n>If you’re interested please apply to the program here: [https://apply.virto.network/](https://apply.virto.network/)\n\n### The Virto Stack\n\nGoing forward we plan to evolve the experience we provide, putting together the tools we've built over the years into a unified solution: The _**Virto Operating System** for autonomous organizations_.\n\n![virto_stack.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfLYqP41sxNM3WNKwGWiWLtK1gznyK9hL387XjD3zQehk)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vUG-UfeXDD3MK-hlwAwG-3o5Dp-B6wc7OvbGDdbeW98/edit)\n- [Previous proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/439)\n- [Product research insights](https://cotton-amber-2dd.notion.site/be82f1076ea0458e845e3323fd5916ba?v=60fa80d2a226442ab8f577b7bb73657d)(in Spanish)\n- Post: [What is Kusama?](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/what-is-kusama-the-innovation-hub-of-polkadot/9931) (A vision for driving innovation)\n- Post: [Sustainability model of a tokenless protocol](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/sustainability-model-of-a-tokenless-protocol/8683)\n\n## Virto FAQ\n\n- **How does Virto keep track of its expenses?**\n\nAll treasury funds are kept on-chain using KSM, ensuring full transparency. This approach allows stakeholders to easily verify expenditures and maintains a clear, immutable record of all financial activities.\n\n- **What defines productivity for the Virto team?**\n\nProductivity is measured by the strategic value provided to the Kusama ecosystem, rather than just the quantity of tools produced. This focuses on creating specialized tools that address critical needs within the network.\n\n- **How much funding has Virto raised from the treasury?**\n\nApproximately $671,754 USD has been raised, with about $350,000 USD effectively available over 3 years due to market volatility, limited DEX liquidity, and tax obligations. This averages to roughly $120,000 USD annually for a team of 6-10 members.\n\n- **How does Virto ensure accountability within its decentralized structure?**\n\nWhile maintaining flexibility for innovation, Virto is open to adopting clear milestones and deliverables. The team welcomes suggestions for improving accountability while balancing the needs of a decentralized project.\n\n- **Is the funding request by Virto too ambitious?**\n\nThe funding request reflects the project's scope and ambition. It's designed to ensure continued significant contributions to the Kusama ecosystem, with potential long-term benefits justifying the current funding levels.\n\n- **How to increase payments pallet adoption?**\n\nVirto is working on improving usability and maintenance of the payments pallet. Broader adoption is expected as the ecosystem evolves and the need for such tools becomes more apparent.\n\n- **Should the Virto team take on more economic risk?**\n\nThe team has already taken considerable economic risk, including opportunity costs and personal resources. However, they're open to exploring hybrid models that balance community funding with self-sustainability.\n\n- **Are documentation and usability issues hindering the effectiveness of Virto's tools?**\n\nEfforts are being made to improve documentation and usability, with some intentional delays to ensure API stability. The team acknowledges these areas as crucial for broader adoption.\n\n- **How does Virto measure the success of its outputs?**\n\nSuccess is measured by the potential of tools and projects to shape the future of the Kusama ecosystem, not just by immediate usage. This considers the long-term impact of innovations that may be ahead of their time.\n\n- **Is the current development structure of Virto effective for delivering meaningful results?**\n\nThe decentralized, flexible approach allows for innovation and adaptability. While open to adjustments, the team believes this structure is conducive to producing high-quality results in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.\n\n- **Could a bounty system or self-funding model improve the project's outcomes?**\n\nA bounty system could align incentives with measurable results, but must be implemented carefully. The team is exploring various models to ensure alignment with Kusama's goals while maintaining innovation flexibility.\n\n- **Why hasn't Virto developed a self-funded model for Kreivo's development?**\n\nDeveloping a self-funded model is complex in the evolving Web3 space. The Kreivo protocol is designed for self-sustainability(see linked post) and the Virto DAO is exploring ways to further monetize the underlying infrastructure.\n\n- **How does Virto plan to ensure the long-term maintenance of its projects?**\n\nPlans are in place to gradually transition projects to more sustainable models, potentially involving collaborations with other ecosystem participants or through community-driven maintenance efforts. e.g. we have members in the Core Polkadot Fellowship and the Polkadot Tooling Collective that could fund parts of our stack in the future.\n\n- **What steps is the Virto team taking to improve the usability of its tools?**\n\nThe team is actively enhancing user experience by refining interfaces, improving documentation, and incorporating community feedback. Usability improvements are an ongoing priority to make tools more accessible to a broader audience.\n\n- **Why should the community continue to support Virto?**\n\nSupporting Virto is an investment in Kusama's mid-to-long-term success. The team is committed to learning from past experiences and improving to ensure future deliverables have a broader impact.\n\n- **What value does Virto provide to the Kusama ecosystem that justifies continued funding?**\n\nVirto provides critical infrastructure and tools supporting the growth and development of the Kusama ecosystem and its organizations. These contributions are essential for the long-term health and expansion of the network.\n\n- **How does Virto prioritize its development goals to align with the community's needs?**\n\nDevelopment goals are prioritized based on community feedback, strategic needs of the Kusama ecosystem, and the potential impact of each project.\n\n- **Is the decentralized approach to Virto's development limiting its effectiveness?**\n\nWhile a decentralized approach presents challenges, it offers advantages in innovation and adaptability. The team believes this approach suits the Web3 space's demands but is open to introducing more structured elements if beneficial.\n\n- **What safeguards are in place to ensure that Virto's funding is used efficiently?**\n\nRegular updates, community reviews, and detailed reporting on fund usage help ensure efficient resource use. The team is exploring ways to implement more robust accountability measures aligned with the project's decentralized nature.\n\n- **How does Virto plan to increase the adoption of its tools and projects?**\n\nIncreasing adoption is a top priority, involving improving usability and documentation, active promotion within the community, collaboration with other projects, educational initiatives, and targeted outreach to demonstrate the value of Virto's contributions.\n \n",

      "content": "This is a proposal for a bounty top-up of the System Parachain Collators funding on Kusama. We are repeating this proposal since the referenda failed, in part due to last minute vote changed due to accusation of double spending. We hope to address this with this **[video ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Mu2ouBdSsxntsmBtbh9uZzKDEEPNsqb/view)** and with the revised parts of the initial proposal.\nIn addition - after the last proposal it was suggested that we elect a coordinator, which we did. Since Paradox has been doing this task for the past year he was suggested and endorsed as the coordinator.\nFurthermore - the market rate has since changed dramatically and we hope to be better aligned with the \"new market rate\" with the revised budget.\n\nThis funding will cover AssetHub, BridgeHub, Coretime, People and Encointer System Parachains on Kusama.\nThis proposal supplements the original System Parachain Collator **[Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pRUj8WZPO75DuwDl4HoZU97v_Rmfx0bZ2KFqFW-qkE/edit)**, and continues the proposal for **[System Parachain funding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2T1Nx90HkSAYF_CaOPLG-o3LS7h_QAa2WLDdcSJMs0/edit)**, aiming to incentivize the best performance, minimize censorship, and maintain liveliness by securing treasury funding for the operational costs of Kusama System Parachain Collators.\nFurthermore it expands its scope to three new System Parachains — Coretime, People and Encointer.\nAdditionally — it introduces newly established methodology of selection criteria for invulnerable collator spots, as well as newly established bidding procedure for securing permissionless spots.\nAll of this is detailed out in the **[Proposal ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qURw3dLd2ioyBD3HocNC7AyuooY34k4X16WNYb0XidY/edit)** document.\n\n**Funding Request:** Infrastructure Costs and Staking Rewards\n**Coverage:** Five Kusama System Parachains (AssetHub, BridgeHub, Coretime, People and Encointer)\n**Duration:** 6-month runway\n**Start Date:** July 1, 2024\n**Funding Amount:** 7,926.62 KSM for Kusama System Parachains\n\n**Note:**\nUnlike most other treasury spends, this spend funds a bounty. If there is a disagreement with any particular portion of the budget we can not disburse it or return that portion to the Treasury.  There are also some budget items that are provisional (like development, price fluctuation, administrative) and these are all reallocated to primary services if not used for the intended purpose.",

      "content": "## Dear Kusama community,\n## &nbsp;Meet ParaSpell: \n\n<img width=\"250\" alt=\"ParaSpell logo\" src=\"https://i.ibb.co/ZHjtZXL/214-Para-Spell-1719786844194.png\">\n\n## A set of powerful XCM Tools ready to elevate your project cross-chain experience\n\n## This is the current state of tools:\nThere are five tools from which - one is core (SDK) for the three (API, ROUTER, VISUALIZATOR). Each tool can be installed independently.\n\n- [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Core component for API, Router and Visualizator. Meant to unify the cross-chain experience on Polkadot and become a layer 2 protocol that allows for seamless integration of XCM into your dApps. XCM SDK groups all 54 integrated XCM-compatible Parachain XCM Pallets into one uniform package and allows you to generate cross-chain calls with just one line.\n- [XCM Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router): (SpellRouter☄️): Meant to allow you to create XCM calls where you receive different assets than assets you send (Eg. Send -> DOT from Polkadot, receive ASTR on Astar)—all in just one call.\n- [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api): (LightSpell⚡️): Meant to ease the integration of XCM interoperability into your dApp, offload your dApp from heavy computing and save you costs. LightSpell implements XCM SDK and XCM Router into simple API endpoints.\n- [XCM Analyser](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser): Tool to convert XCM Multilocations to human-readable format. Written in emphasis on minimalistic dependency list.\n- [XCM Visualizator](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe): Tool to visualize XCM in the Polkadot ecosystem. Browse through history, explore selected Parachains, filter accounts engaging in XCM the most and more all in exciting 3D universe-like visualization.\n\n## The core and the only XCM SDK you will ever need\nCreated, when there were no other SDKs for XCM in the ecosystem. At the sole beginning of Polkadot. Born from a wild idea, to unify the XCM experience in the ecosystem. Meet our battle-hardened and well-established [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk).\n[![sdk](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/4348e5e4-b4cc-4205-a890-41efc6cfac15)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\n### The abilities you gain by using XCM SDK:\n- Ability to transfer XCM messages from/to 54 different XCM compatible Parachains (Number of compatible chains fluctuates as some of them are added/removed)\n- Support for all three XCM transfer scenarios (UMP - Para to Relay, DMP - Relay to Para, HRMP - Para to Para)\n- Support for multi-asset transfers and fully customizable multi-locations (for destination chains, accounts and currencies)\n- Customizable XCM version (If our preselected version stops working, you can select one that works with just one simple parameter)\n- Asset claim feature with reduced parameters (Only 3 parameters required - chain, amount and address)\n- Polkadot <> Kusama bridge implemented for both DOT & KSM transfers\n- Testing on testnet or localhost (You can input custom WS port parameter or even custom Parachain ID)\n- Useful [transfer info queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/xcmPallet.html#xcm-transfer-info) (Query fees, expected delivery amount and other transfer-related info all in just one query)\n- Front-end related data queries - useful [asset queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/AssetPallet.html), [XCM pallet queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/NodePallets.html), [existential deposit queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/xcmPallet.html#query-existential-deposit) and more!\n- Ability to use a keep-alive kind of XCM transfer which checks the balance of the account on the destination chain and determines if the amount you send is sufficient.\n\n**XCM SDK has since the last 9 months of maintenance had a total of 23506 downloads on NPMJS**\n\n## Sending one asset cross-chain and receiving another was never this easy\nMeet our latest state-of-the-art technology called [XCM-Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router).

Conferences we choose are with higher standards and higher Z-indexes. We were so far able to publish a total of 5️⃣ professional research articles:\n  - Sharing fungible assets across Polkadot Paraverse: IEEE ICECET 2022 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9872938/)\n  - Enhancing XCMP Interoperability Across Polkadot Paraverse: IEEE ICBC 2023 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174872)\n  - ParaSpell XCM SDK: A New Protocol for Interoperability in Polkadot Paraverse: IEEE BCCA 2023 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10338906)\n  - Cross-Chain Payments on Blockchain Networks: An Apartment Booking Use-Case: ACM SAC 2024 - [link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605098.3636137)\n  - Interlinked Transactions: Revolutionizing Apartment Bookings through Cross-Chain Payments: BCCA 2024 - [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380904884_Interlinked_Transactions_Revolutionizing_Apartment_Bookings_through_Cross-Chain_Payments)\n  - Cross-Chain Non-Fungible Assets Sharing on Polkadot - Currently submitted to the conference and in the review process\n\n<!-- -->\n\n**The team behind the project has been hacking in the Polkadot ecosystem for a while now.** \n\nConsisting of 2 members:\n\n- Dušan Morháč: [PBA 2023 Buenos Aires Alumni](<https://singular.app/collectibles/statemine/20/12>), Building in ecosystem since 2021, [LINKEDIN](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/dudo50/>), [GITHUB](<https://github.com/dudo50>). \n- Michael Absolon: Typescript expert with 4 years of professional experience, Building in the ecosystem since 2022, [LINKEDIN](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael--absolon/>), [GITHUB](<https://github.com/michaeldev5>).\n\nBoth team members achieved their Master's degree recently (June 2024) and are working on ParaSpell full-time. Dušan continues to study for a Doctoral degree (To be able to continue research passion and release more research papers for Polkadot and ParaSpell).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\nThe proposal aims to aid server costs and maintenance for the 🥇 first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api) and [XCM Visualizator](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe) in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Maintaining XCM API, [XCM ROUTER](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router) and XCM Visualizator also include maintaining its core component - [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk). These common good tools along with [XCM Analyser](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser), [XCM Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/playground), [Documentation](https://github.com/paraspell/docs) and [Landing page](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/landing-page) will be fully maintained for the mentioned period starting on 1st August 2024 and ending on 1st February 2025. This proposal allows all tools to remain completely free for the entire Polkadot and Kusama communities. It also allows our team to dedicate time to help other teams that wish to implement our tools.\n\n### What are you getting by implementing one of our tools or more\n- Complex free support with implementation (Through a private telegram group between our and your team (We usually respond within minutes and we are also open to live calls when time plays a role in your project delivery - form to reach out to us can be found on our [Landing page](https://lightspell.xyz/)))\n- Prompt issue solving if any occurs (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n- Constant updates for every package (We strive to bring new features for each tool)\n- Comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) for each tool\n- Reliability (Checked each month for changes in Pallets or compatible Parachains)\n- **Guarantee, that everything is free for everyone. The ParaSpell✨ team aims to deliver only the common good, be completely open-source and free with no hidden costs or subscriptions.**\n\n### What are you getting as a non-developer/dApp user by supporting this proposal\n- Our products allow dApps to be created much faster, so you can enjoy their benefits quicker.\n- You can be sure, that dApp implementing our tool is safe for XCM as our tools are thoroughly tested and regularly updated. There are multiple ways to lose assets cross-chain.\n- You too can try our products via the [Playground](https://playground.paraspell.xyz/).\n- We have been in the ecosystem for a while now and we are hardcore ecosystem fans. We will continue maintaining the tools even if we are short of funding (Just at a slower pace). So you do not have to deal with your dApp suddenly disabling your favourite feature. This is because we primarily build and maintain these tools to make life easier for everyone - not for profits (There is no business model or hidden fees in any of our tools. They are purely common good).\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n- Discussion: 1. July. 2024 - 8. July. 2024\n- Voting: 9. July. 2024 - 22. July. 2024\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Proposal ask\nThe proposal seeks 48.000$ worth of funding for 6 months of various maintenance tasks and assistance to other teams. This is divided into 8.000$ per month and 25$ per developer work hour. More information can be found in the full proposal document.\n\n## Documents associated with this proposal:\n\n**[Full proposal (Contains detailed information on how we plan to use funds)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Dd9kDmWW6Le0O7wB5ZpAbCI4ifcfEELtFk_zGE0m_yQ/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n[One pager](<https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuXF5a0As/ylxqRR43pe3_XRWC27IH-A/edit?utm_content=DAFuXF5a0As&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton>)\n\n[Documentation for XCM Tools](<https://paraspell.github.io/docs/>)\n",

Payouts for community validators\n2. Clearing submission and decision deposits on Kusama and its fellowship counterpart\n\nThe funding is expected to last approximately 4 months given validator payees growth from 168 (current) to 200.\n\nA few related notes:\n- The scripts used for clearing Kusama's submission deposits require updating after one of the previous runtime upgrade.  This should be completed within the next week.\n- Efforts are made to reduce flooding of payouts at the end of an era\n- I've worked on [a branch](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/tree/payout_adjustments) to support \"grouped payouts\" on Crunch. \n\nThe public is welcomed to examine the accounts [transaction history](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Gch4VxQ79WhjgQqHomvJbqF3Woza5g5cYgM8SVQdDb9szz1).\n\nKind Regards,\nWill | Paradox",

      "content": "I had a previous preimage, but I don't know what happened and sent it empty, pls feedback and reconsideration of your vote. \n\nWhy on Kusama? Because we need to Test Chaos. \n\n- Name of the Hackathon: \"Digital Voting within the Blockchain\"\n- Dates: May 28-29, 2024, announced on May 17th, 2024\n- Number of Hackers: 50 max, currently registered 39 (EVM mostly)\n- Asked KSM: 278 KSM\n\n**Disclosure: I can't guarantee any publicity or branding besides Substrate within hackathon activities, this is a public good hackathon.**\n\n\nThe ****Mexican Deputy Chamber ****is organizing a hackathon related to**** \"Digitial Voting within the Blockchain\"****, the delegated organizers are a Mexican Web3 media project called ****[Kairos Research](https://x.com/Research_Kairos)****, and the rules for the hackathon are tech agnostic, however, the main focus of Kairos is EVM based developments, which is not so agnostic, undermining the possibilities to expose any other tech to legislative stakeholders that can make changes to regulations and laws.\n\nThe hackathon arose because, as the [spoken words](https://x.com/Research_Kairos/status/1791529527786549467) of the organizers,### \"We know there are people out there building things with blockchain, and we want to know what they are building, and proposing\", and the mentors and tracks are EVM based, which put Substrate based ecosystem at the disadvantage of discovery and top of mind for all the projects and people that we are working with it.\n\nThe proposal is as follows; we are partnering with Kairos with a side track for prizes related to Substrate implementations ****(3 tracks in total, 30 KSMv per track)**** we are doing a Substrate Tutorial with Adrian Mont, PBA BA Alumni, which is going to be online, and the hackathon day, he'll be helping with the implementations of the ones who choose substrate, and other workshops related to Polkadot and Crash Courses made by me (Edgar Salinas, PBA HK alumni) through Peranto, related to Laws and Regulations for Digital Voting and possible standalone solutions for digital voting, Technical Blockchain Concepts related to international standards as ISOs, and tokenomics.\n\nThis proposal isn't just the prize distribution, it's a showcase and testing to show the developments within Kusama/Polkadot, we are using for the Digital Token (KSM) distribution a parachain called Kreivo, they are focused on the creation of DAOs and their management, including treasury management, this will show the participants and stakeholders the possibilities of building with substrate and belonging to the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nWe are using Peranto dApp to DIDsign all documents for the winners, through statements that show that the proceedings of the funds are legit, and show that isn't Money Laundry and isn't something sketchy, including in this proposal and how it works OpenGov. This way, we can help lawmakers understand and acknowledge the advantages of this software as KSM or DOT, and show practically the capabilities of blockchain solutions such as Peranto CiGo built on KILT Protocol, and Kreivo-Virto built on Substrate, secured by Kusama.\nThis testing is big, I've decided to \"Test Chaos\" through Virto, Peranto, and any other project within the ecosystem for developing the web3 ecosystem in Mexico, not only showcasing to key stakeholders but also testing out with academic and institutional players.\n\nFor this proposal, I'm having the support from Polkadot Mexico Ambassadors, for on-site assistance, and learning material distribution, Adrian Mont from Gear Foundation (Vara Network) for the Substrate workshops, and VirtoBDao, for onboarding and technical assistance.\nThe full DIDsign documents you can find it here, and download them if you want:\n\n****Written Proposal\nImportant: Download it on PDF ****\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1ObldbVDqQ8_Jywfs-HyXF4LwXLJzHfrV_saMoXVNct8/edit?usp=sharing\n****\nDIDsignature for the written proposal You can download the document on pdf erase the one from the DID sign verifier, and check that it's the same information.****\nhttps://multisign.vercel.app/verifier?multiSign=6gvo4oucf&did=4ohQ3UkcJARKYPzAG2HsCY176RSH7bRx3NpJtj3x3qtK9Ex6\n\n****Proposal Budget and Funds Allocation\nImportant: Download it on PDF\" ****\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PzuiADB6BC5j5bUq6QJ5Du0TPw1CLf8xNoARp0VBgtY/edit?usp=sharing\n\n****DIDsignature for the written proposal You can download the document on pdf erase the one from the DID sign verifier, and check that it's the same information. ****\n\nhttps://multisign.vercel.app/verifier?multiSign=oyijeulsm&did=did:kilt:4ohQ3UkcJARKYPzAG2HsCY176RSH7bRx3NpJtj3x3qtK9Ex6\n\n",

      "title": "Customized Kusama Chocolate Bars | Proof of Taste - 2nd Edition for Polkadot Decoded",
      "content": "Since the [Proof of Taste customized Kusama/Polkdaot chocolate bars](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/99) were well received last year, I'd like to manage the production of a 2nd Proof of Taste edition.\n\nThe graphic designer designed a couple of designs last year, of which only one was chosen and finally used for the 1st edition of Proof of Taste chocolate. Hence, we have some designs left, which we can use, without paying the graphic designer again ($500 dollar payment back then).\n\nAfter talking and brainstorming with Adam Steeber, we/he came up with the idea to produce a bigger batch and share them at Polkadot Decoded. Hence the request for a bigger KSM amount compared to last time.\n\nMy learning from the first edition was that i underestimated the shipping costs to remote places around the world. With the requested amount of 150KSM (approximately $4500/€4175) we'll be able to order around 250 editions and still be able to ship some boxes via mail if requested. \n\nInstead of shipping all the chocolate all around the world like last time, my plan is to keep a certain amount (for example 75%) of the boxes for Polkadot Decoded 2024 in Brussels. They can be given away randomly at the event or maybe we can arrange some kind of lottery.\nI'm happy to hear your ideas about how to share them to the Decoded audience in a fun and exciting way :)\n\nI talked with the team behind the organisation of Decoded and they told me that i can ship the batch to their warehouse and from there they would take over the shipment to Brussels for Polkadot Decoded. This will help me a lot to manage the logistics of the bulky and heavy order.\n\nWith having the majority of the boxes in Brussels for Decoded, we can share them easier and for less costs to visitors of the event and I guess it's a cool story to bring our own branded chocolate to Brussels, which is known for its premium chocolate!\n\nEstimated costs:\n\n- €2230 for chocolate manufacturing, 250 boxes each two chocolate bars (without VAT)\n- €415 for chocolate bar packaging for 500 chocolate bars in total (without VAT)\n- €189 for box packaging for 250 boxes (without VAT)\n- €541 for shipping & handling costs to Decoded warehouse & individual users  (without VAT)\n- €800 for 0,19% VAT for German tax authorities\n\n∑ €4175 / $4500 / 150 KSM (~$30)\n\nThanks to Coinstudio, Adam Clay Steeber, & I Love Crypto for their direct support to help me set up this proposal! \nAnd thanks to all the voters and recipients of the last years edition, who helped make it happen and provided positive feedback about the tasty chocolate! \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCouple of links about the history and build of for this proposal:\n\n--> Polkassembly discussion published before this proposal was released [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2631)\n\n--> see original polkassembly posting and discussion for the 1st edition in 2023 [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2406)\n\n--> copy of the link to the full proposal from last year for 1st edition can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vn8IP-YyvTWWDvzMI6JJIDn_ZAVSi9OC/view)\n\n--> Link to manufacturer [here](https://www.zotter.at/en/your-edition/your-personalised-design)\n\n--> check out last years 1st edition [here](https://medium.com/@babespapes/proof-of-taste-9702cac7bd9f)",

      "title": "Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Asset Hub (Kusama) Networks (from January 2023 to March 2024)",
      "content": "> This is a follow-up proposal to what we submitted before:\n\n[#229 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine (from July to December 2022)](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/229)\n\n> This is also a re-submission of Referendum 316:\n\n[#316 Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine Networks (from January to September 2023)](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/316)\n\n\n## Overview\n\nSubscan serves as a vital block explorer and analytics tool within the Substrate ecosystem, offering valuable insights to its community. However, maintaining and operating Subscan demands significant resource investments, encompassing server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Thus, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fees for Subscan from January 2023 to March 2024 from the Kusama treasury, ensuring its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\nWe highly prioritize feedback from our community users. In Q3 2023, we made substantial efforts to reduce infrastructure costs, yielding effective and gratifying results. Operational expenses gradually decreased starting from July 2023 and have recently stabilized. As an example, our GCP bill for September 2023 decreased by more than 50.52% compared to its historical peak.\n\nIn this re-submission, we appended billing information covering October 2023 through March 2024. While ongoing block production growth naturally increases GCP expenses, we managed to moderate this increase, ensuring slow and predictable billing growth over the recent half-year. Particularly noteworthy is the March 2024 bill, significantly lower than its March 2023 counterpart despite the elapsed year, showcasing the substantial efficacy and enduring benefits of our Operations and Maintenance Cost Reduction Plan.\n\n## Re-submission Details\n\nFollowing the rejection of [Referendum 316](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/316), we diligently reviewed and implemented optimization strategies suggested by the community. Data from the past 9 months demonstrates that these measures have been highly effective, making future costs more predictable.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the Kusama network has not covered any costs for Subscan for 15 months, posing a significant financial challenge for our team. The substantial cost shortfall has us concerned about our future. Should this proposal not be approved, we may need to consider pausing the development of new features for the Kusama network, potentially impacting the ecosystem negatively—an outcome we earnestly wish to avoid.\n\nWe appeal to the Polkadot community for support in this proposal. Our commitment to enhancing and maintaining the infrastructure remains steadfast. By securing the necessary funding, we can continue our work without interruptions or compromises, ensuring the robustness and innovation of the ecosystem.\n\n**View detail [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kGJIExM-rzPGucsExHqxFkqV5etZBwCVWcDn08ae-f8/edit?usp=sharing).**",

      "content": "### Introduction\n\nThe Dots Magazine is an initiative created by two Polkadot fans who have been in the Polkadot ecosystem for years, since 2020. Our passion lies not just in the technology and architecture of Polkadot, but we also believe as its one of few, or even the only future-proof ecosystem. Basically, if you’re in the crypto for long-term, you've got no other place to go except Polkadot - just joking! Or maybe not?\n\nThat’s why we came to Polkadot. Initially, we started The Dots to make memes, but soon we realised that its’ potential lays far beyond than just meme posting, but fully potential entertainment/technical Polkadot newspaper and media.\n\n### What is The Dots?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/TheDotsMagazine\n\nPolkadot non-nerdy entertainment news media. Our main goal is to highlight recent ecosystem updates, educate people about Polkadot and explain complex things in an easy language. We’re creating Polkadot news media for normies, who’s just joined the crypto and wants to know more about Polkadot and its parachains. Using the internet language, power of memes and humour is the best way to onboard new users into such complex things as crypto.\n\n\n### Who are We? \n\nJohn Mental ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/Web3Promoteam)), a Polkadot Senior Ambassador, Web3 content creator and contributor to the ecosystem since 2020. Councillor at Basilisk, Hydrator and contributor at HydraDX. \n\nMantra ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/m0neymantra)), a Web3 addict and professional content creator. Ambassador at Polimec and Candidate at Phala Network. Just cool and dedicated. \n\n### What have we done so far? \n\nWe started our journey in January and at the moment of publishing the proposal, we gained 1.1k Twitter followers which is a very solid achievement (all our audience is 100% live and organic). \n\nWe published series of Blitz videos during the Sub0 Polkadot Asia to show that Polkadot is also about fun and how people in the community are passionate about it, so far we’re receiving only positive feedback and we’re happy to move forward, the Treasury funding will allow us to produce more professional and quality content, as we’ll be able to dedicate more time to our project and involve more people in the production. Two full interviews with Jay Chrawna and Alice_und_Bob are finished and set into the pipeline for this week. \n\n### Our Metrics\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/vji2SjO.jpeg)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YaKI7Gf.png)\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n**Beneficiary**: DJxMY9rfpFcoNAC251FJg1qC2UQxDrjKK3HcBcRK6aNncWc\n\n**Requested KSM**: 235.4209 KSM\n$10,000.00 in equivalent of KSM for 6 month of operational work  \n\nAverage KSM price for the last 7D: 42.4771\n\n**Working hour**: 30$ \n\n**Total working hours per week**: 14 hours per week (including expenses on part-time production team) \n\n**Total**: 336 hours, not including brainstorms, community calls, Twitter and governance research and other stuff.\n\n_______________________________________________\n\nImportant Note: We haven't received any tips or funding from any project so far for our work and are currently operating solely as enthusiasts and advocates for the ecosystem. Should the community approve our proposal and appreciate our efforts, we will then operate entirely on Treasury funds, focusing on highlighting ecosystem updates and assisting parachain teams in building their communities.\n\n[Full Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/176YdqXLs2psLCZnWAkgde_CjGcPVXTryOSZ8QxNuwPk/edit#heading=h.xghghca08xyd)\n",

Concretely we look to on-board 5 to 10 new DAOs(communities) by the end of Q2 to help us gather important feedback that help us build a product the Kusama community but more importantly regular users will be happy to use.\n\nThe team will also use the funds to contribute to the core Polkadot protocol via the technical Fellowship in topics we've become quite proficient like governance improvements. \n\n---\n\n**Budget:** 1 FTE ~= 6,500 USD **|** 1 Month * 9 FTE = 58,500 USD **|** 3 month(9 FTE) = **175,500 USD**.\n**Asked:** 3,333 KSM * 50.54 USD/KSM(EMA30) = **168,449.82 USD**.\n\n---\n\nFor more context please refer to previous proposals or leave us a comment to elaborate more on any given topic.\n\n> The Virto team continues to have the long term vision to tackle social inequality and will continue to shape its experiments and developments towards said goal.",

We were trying to teleport 50 KSM from our account on Bridgehub-Kusama to Kusama.\n\nWe first tried with small amounts after we had found the right working call and then we thought copied the call-data to initiate the actual transfer, but it was an old copy that lead to the error of `unroutable`, which is a fatal error and the tokens get lost apparently in the system. We don't know where they get lost. You can see it in the [events](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fsys.ibp.network%2Fbridgehub-kusama#/explorer/query/0xbe5d33b166c6e839eba295c04c646c512bd715622ad8faf2287f1ea9d9f098ee) that the tokens don't get deposited anywhere. This is new information to us.\n\nThis is the call-data I have used: `0x1f0903000109030300010100666963fc8192623504df2da473a1db2c69e1660463e2fd5071bcc68a96c3970d0304000100000b00203d88792d0000000000`\n\nThis would have been the correct call-data: `0x1f090301000300010100666963fc8192623504df2da473a1db2c69e1660463e2fd5071bcc68a96c3970d0304000100000b00203d88792d0000000000`\n\nOur request is to recover the 50 KSM from openGov to the account that made call.\n\n-   The call was our mistake, we should have double checked.\n-   There is work in progress by the core developers to make sure these errors are claimable in the future, but it's not in production yet.\n-   The 50 KSM was on that account was to bid for a system-collator slot for bridgehub, which we didn't win. The teleport was one way until runtime upgrade `1,001,000`",

      "title": "Polkadot OpenGov Voting Observer Twitter Bot",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nThis proposal includes a decrease in the funding amount for Referendum 346. Initially set at 200 KSM, it has been reduced to 75 KSM based on suggestions from many voters in a previous referendum.\n\nThis reduction in funding will not lead to any cost-cutting measures or a decline in bot quality.\n\nI am thrilled to present the \"Polkadot OpenGov Observer\" project, We are seeking funding of 75 KSM ($3,695) to support the growth and development of this initiative.\n\n**Project Overview:**\n\nThe [Polkadot OpenGov Observer](https://twitter.com/OpengovWatcher) is a tool designed to showcase real-time OpenGov activities on Twitter, providing a comprehensive monthly overview of Polkadot OpenGov Treasury and voters' charts. The primary objective is to enhance community engagement, encourage participation in OpenGov voting, and foster a better understanding of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Beneficiary Information:**\n\n-   Beneficiary: Polkadot OpenGov Observer Multisig\n-   ![](https://i.ibb.co/98hxJBf/Screenshot-2024-02-16-at-12-03-08-PM.png)\n-   Address:\n    \n    DZL1jjADYBhsRY9oJp8ETYtHV64Z4iz97Rvtj8pv2VP1nEN\n    \n\n**Requested Amount:**\n\n-   75 KSM ($3,695)\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nFunding\n\n**Networks**\n\nKusama & Polkadot\n\n**Mission and Impact:**\n\nOur mission is to expand the adoption of Polkadot OpenGov across different communities. By leveraging social platforms like Twitter, where 90% of the web3 ecosystem is active, we aim to make concepts surrounding OpenGov more accessible and engaging.\n\nCurrently, only 13.1% of DOT holders participate in governance. We believe that increasing this percentage to 40% will lead to more informed and fair decisions within the Polkadot OpenGov system. Our strategy involves showcasing the activities of voters on Polkadot through the OpenGov Observer, making it a valuable tool for evaluating and choosing the best delegates.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/VJg97Nw/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-1-16-10-PM.png)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TPh3nKn/Screenshot-2024-02-14-at-1-15-36-PM.png)\n\n**Open Source GitHub Repository**\n\n[Polkadot OpenGov Observer](https://github.com/AshutoshSingh00001/Polkadot-OpenGov-Observer) Github repo\n\n**List of Tools and Api's used for Twitter Bot**\n\n_Subscan Api_\n\n_polkassembly Api_\n\n_Node js_\n\n_Twitter Api_\n\n_Express_\n\n_Polkadot Js Api_\n\n_Coin Gecko Api_\n\n**Current Stats:**\n\n-   Active Voters: 1,868,686.843\n-   Referenda Participation: 13.10%\n\n**Future Impacts and Plans:**\n\nThe project is focused on making OpenGov widely used and accessible to everyone. Our implemented features include OpenGov Activity Monitoring, displaying new vote activities in real-time, and providing a monthly overview of OpenGov, voters, and the treasury. This will be instrumental in attracting those interested in OpenGov, whether they are new to the concept or seeking funding for their web3 projects. We aim to build a vibrant and active community of developers within the web3 space.\n\nAs we move forward, we will continue to refine and expand our project, ensuring that Polkadot OpenGov becomes a central hub for decentralized decision-making and community involvement.\n\nThank you for considering our proposal, and we look forward to contributing to the growth and success of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nBest regards, Ashutosh Singh (Project Creator and Head, Polkadot OpenGov Observer)",

      "content": "## Dear Kusama community,\n\n##  Meet ParaSpell:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/h7j6qDm/main-Logo.png)\n\n## A set of common good XCM tools.\n\n## This is the current state of tools:\n\nThere are three tools from which - one is core for the other two. Each tool can be installed independently.\n\n-   [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Core component for both API and Router. Meant to unify the cross-chain experience on Polkadot and become a layer 2 protocol that allows for seamless integration of XCM into your dApps. XCM SDK groups all 50 integrated XCM-compatible Parachain XCM Pallets into one uniform package and allows you to generate cross-chain calls with just one line.\n-   [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api): (LightSpell⚡️): Meant to ease the integration of XCM interoperability into your dApp, offload your dApp from heavy computing and save you costs. LightSpell implements XCM SDK into simple API endpoints.\n-   [XCM Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router): (SpellRouter☄️): Meant to allow you to create XCM calls where you receive different assets than assets you send (Eg. Send -> DOT from Polkadot, receive ASTR on Astar)—all in just one call.\n\n## The core and the only XCM SDK you will ever need\n\nCreated, when there were no other SDKs for XCM in the ecosystem. At the sole beginning of Polkadot. Born from a wild idea, to unify the XCM experience in the ecosystem. Meet our battle-hardened and well-established [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk).\n\n[![sdk](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/4348e5e4-b4cc-4205-a890-41efc6cfac15)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\n### The abilities you gain by using XCM SDK:\n\n-   Ability to transfer XCM messages from/to 50 different XCM compatible Parachains (Number of compatible chains fluctuates as some of them are added/removed)\n-   Support for all three XCM transfer scenarios (UMP - Para to Relay, DMP - Relay to Para, HRMP - Para to Para)\n-   Testing on testnet or localhost (You can input custom API parameter or even custom Parachain ID)\n-   Useful asset queries, XCM pallet queries, minimal deposit queries and more!\n-   Ability to use a keep-alive kind of XCM transfer which checks the balance of the account on the destination chain and determines if the amount you send is sufficient.\n\n**XCM SDK has since the last 4 months of maintenance had a total of 7.287 downloads on NPMJS**\n\n## Want to go packageless and save space? We got you\n\nMeet our [award-winning](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api) in the ecosystem. XCM API packs every XCM SDK and XCM-Router feature and allows you to implement XCM packagelessly.\n\n[![api](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/e81d3404-f29f-43d8-8744-a7104569b6b7)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api)\n\n### The advantages of LightSpell⚡️ XCM API for developers:\n\n-   Simplified XCM message construction via unified patterns\n-   XCM API reduces call construction time to seconds\n-   Built-in user error prevention for seamless operation\n-   Built-in Token authentication for DDoS prevention\n-   Easy to use tech stack: Typescript, Nest.js, ParaSpell XCM-SDK\n-   Completely free with an MIT license\n-   Also designed for simple private deploy\n-   XCM API handles complex logic and you are only required to provide basic details to create calls (Junctions and other complex details are auto-filled for you)\n-   API Offloads your server from heavy computing required to construct calls (You receive constructed message already)\n-   API saves you server costs (Because of the reason mentioned above)\n-   API features Package-less integration (No need to install anything compared to SDK alternatives)\n-   API is simple to implement (Constructed to be as dev-friendly as possible)\n-   API is already live on the following link: [https://api.lightspell.xyz](https://api.lightspell.xyz)\n\n**XCM API Served since its launch 142 days ago (September 13th. 2023) a total of 126.782 requests and faced 0 downtime**\n\n## Sending one asset cross-chain and receiving another was never this easy\n\nMeet our latest state-of-the-art technology called [XCM-Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router). It is easy to implement and has plenty of awesome features like automatic exchange chain selection! Featuring **579** asset exchange pools makes it the largest liquidity routing tool in the Polkadot. Try it out via [playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router/tree/main/playground)!\n\n[![router](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/a13e17fa-7c9f-4c36-a37a-d1770b29bee7)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router)\n\n### You gain the following advantages by implementing SpellRouter☄️:\n\n-   The ability to transfer assets cross-chain via XCM while being able to exchange them for another asset all within one call.\n-   Offlift users from the complexity of moving assets to another chain in order to exchange tokens just to send them to another chain later\n-   Developers able to hide asset exchange complexity and skip multiple implementation steps\n-   Developers save the time required for complex research\n-   Complex logic hidden in simple one-line calls\n\n**Eager to find out how XCM Router works? Check out the sequential diagram below.** (This example uses XCM Router implemented in XCM API)\n\n![275827358-d0cf38cc-48e2-4b25-9853-8c2b59e0424f](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/ae457dda-b744-453e-acd1-f8a14d86a5e8)\n\n**XCM ROUTER has since it was introduced 49 days ago (Dec 15th. 2023) had a total of 1.826 downloads on NPMJS**\n\n## Implementation made easy with our [docs](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\nMeet our comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) covering just about every topic developers will meet with when implementing XCM and our tools into their dAPPs.\n\n[![docs](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/02abaaa4-8166-4058-a240-2771d3b35df2)](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\n**Docs had a total of 109 refactor and update deployments on GitHub pages since their launch**\n\n## Our team and history:\n\n-   By now we completed 5 Web 3 Foundation grants meant to fund the development of our common good tools. This goes to show our dedication to the topic and the community. They can be observed here: [Phase 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1118), [Phase 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1245), [Phase 3](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1589), [Phase 4](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1817) and [Phase 5](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2057).\n-   We have been granted trust from the Kusama community twice in the following grant proposals that helped us further perfect our tools: [Maintenance 1](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/123) and [Maintenance 2](277) in which we have 1 last month to cover (February).\n-   Our latest achievement is getting 🥇first place at the Polkadot Global Series APAC 2023 Hackathon in the XCM Integration track with XCM API. [Here is the final announcement post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\n\n**The team behind the project has been hacking in the Polkadot ecosystem for a while now.** The team consists of 2 members:\n\n-   Dušan Morháč: [Recent PBA 2023 Buenos Aires Alumni](https://singular.app/collectibles/statemine/20/12), Building in ecosystem since 2021, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dudo50/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/dudo50)\n-   Michael Absolon: Typescript expert with 3 years of professional experience, Building in the ecosystem since 2022, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael--absolon/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/michaeldev5)\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\n\nThe proposal aims to aid server costs and maintenance for the 🥇 first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api) and [XCM ROUTER](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router) in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Maintaining XCM API and XCM ROUTER also includes maintaining its core component - [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk). These common good tools will be fully maintained for the mentioned period starting on 1st March and ending on 1st August. This proposal allows all three tools to remain completely free for the entire Polkadot and Kusama community. It also allows our team to dedicate time to help other teams that wish to implement our tools.\n\n### What are you getting by implementing one of our tools or more\n\n-   Complex support with implementation (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n-   Prompt issue solving if any occurs (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n-   Constant updates for every package (We strive to bring new features for each tool)\n-   Comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) for each tool\n-   Reliability (Checked each month for changes in Pallets or compatible Parachains)\n-   **Guarantee, that everything is free for everyone. The ParaSpell✨ team aims to deliver only the common good, be completely open-source and free with no hidden costs or subscriptions.**\n\n### What are you getting as a non-developer/dApp user by supporting this proposal\n\n-   Our products allow dApps to be created much faster, so you can enjoy their benefits quicker.\n-   You can be sure, that dApp implementing our tool is safe for XCM as our tools are thoroughly tested and regularly updated. There are multiple ways to lose assets cross-chain.\n-   You too can try our products via the Playgrounds we build [API Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api/tree/main/playground), [Router Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router/tree/main/playground) or try out the [deployed version of Playground](https://playground.paraspell.xyz/).\n-   We have been in the ecosystem for a while now and we are hardcore ecosystem fans. We will continue maintaining the tools even if we are short of funding (Just at a slower pace). So you do not have to deal with your dApp suddenly disabling your favorite feature. This is because we primarily build and maintain these tools to make life easier for everyone - not for profits (There is no business model or hidden fees in any of our tools. They are purely common good).\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n-   Discussion: 2. Feb. 2024 - 8. Feb. 2024\n-   Voting: 9. Feb. 2024 - 22. Feb. 2024\n\n## Proposal ask\n\nThe proposal seeks 30.000$ worth of funding for 5 months of various maintenance tasks and assistance to other teams. This is divided into 6.000$ per month and 25$ per work hour. More information can be found in the full proposal document.\n\n## Documents associated with this proposal:\n\n**[Full proposal (Contains detailed information on how we plan to use funds)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AfRYf-dcEec-7VXJuLtJjPMCRZ0vo145TLgZj_SPKZA/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n[One pager](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuXF5a0As/ylxqRR43pe3_XRWC27IH-A/edit?utm_content=DAFuXF5a0As&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)\n\n[Documentation for XCM ROUTER, XCM API & XCM SDK](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\n[Forum post prior to this discussion](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-revolutionary-set-of-xcm-tools-for-dapp-developers-paraspell/5625)",

      "content": "The project involves creating graffiti artworks featuring the Kusama logo in various cities, commencing with Barcelona. The process encompasses designing a template, and paint it with black spray in urban locations. Each graffiti piece will then be photographed and transformed into a non-fungible token (NFT), minted on the Kusama blockchain.\n\nIn the future, we anticipate individuals utilizing our template to make their own graffiti in different cities, financed by the treasury and upload it to the blockchain. Each graffiti point needs to be geolocated, enabling visits to these locations as if they were sanctuaries during travels. A symbolic gesture of reverence—bending the knee in front of the Kusama logo—is encouraged. Cities must have a population exceeding 2,000,000, and once a city is adorned, it cannot be repeated.\n\nInspired by Foucault's analysis of panopticism as a power mechanism, we propose subverting this paradigm. Placing the Kusama logo strategically in urban settings transforms it into a symbol of rebellion—an inversion of the panoptic gaze. Each graffiti piece disrupts passive surveillance, converting public spaces into active sites of resistance. Drawing further inspiration from Paul B. Preciado, our graffiti project becomes a performative act challenging conventional discourse surrounding public space.\n\nTo sum up: A swift template of the KSM logo, creating graffiti, capturing it in a photo, uploading the NFT on StateMine, and geolocating it for others to visit and bend the knee.\n\nAllocation:\n\n·        Idea: 69 KSM\n\nRisk+Expenses: 42 KSM (spray, template, time etc..)\n\nWe propose these rules for participants in this Project for the first 10 cities:\n\n·        42 KSM (max allocation)\n\n·        City must be >2,000,000 population or the most populated city in the country. (for example: Vatican City)\n\n·        Can’t repeat cities\n\n·        Photo of the NFT. Upload it and geolocate it.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/g6JmpF7/OIG-E8-Wc2pi-CDWKip.jpg)",

We would like to continue this service but will need some funding for this.\n\nAlso we revived our [snapshot](https://stakeworld.io/docs/snapshot) service. The service was still online but was not being updated anymore. \n\nSince it was getting used more and more again in light of the recent beefy introduction which disables warp sync and the update notes referal to our snapshot service as a solution (for the time being) we refreshed our snapshots to a more current state and after discussions on element are also <s>considering</s> including rocksdb again. This will probably be only for a few months untill warp sync gets re-enabled with beefy. \n\nSee [here](https://github.com/stakeworld/stakeworld-treasury/blob/master/2023-Q4.kusama.md) for the proposal.\n\nRegards,\nMax | Stakeworld.io\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakeworld/stakeworld-treasury/master/2023-Q4-dbsize.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stakeworld/stakeworld-treasury/master/2023-Q4-dbsize2.png)",

      "content": "Dear Kusama community,\n\nCollators on System Parachains are provided with minimal rewards for block production and small incentives in terms of transaction fees. This reduces incentives for Collators to act in a favorable manner and they may also be inclined to under-resourcing their hosts to save costs. Collators should receive funding for the provision of their services. Ultimately, this should be provided by the chain in a preferably sustainable manner. Implementation of such a system is a long-term solution. In the medium term, funding for collators can be provided by the respective Treasuries in the form of a bounty. This allows funding to be pre-allocated and independently managed.\n\nThis proposal is the final monthly operating costs payment for service providers in Q4 2023. Future cost compensation will be done under the [Kusama System Parachain Collators Bounty 20](../post/2613) starting from January 2024.\n\n**[Full Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UQi_DFP99i-VE8tOEQQHR10xqbIPHLqGHNW0f1imuEE/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\nThe proposal aims to secure 844.654 KSM for Collators on the Kusama System Parachains network for services delivered for 3 months - 10-12/2023.\n\n![](https://example.com/your-image.png)![](https://i.ibb.co/W5Jdk2r/Screenshot-2023-11-21-at-23-52-39.png)\n\nWe encourage the Kusama community to review this proposal and provide any feedback or suggestions.\n\nThank you!",

I also created [a test script](https://github.com/xlc/chopsticks-ksm-xcm/tree/master) using Chopsticks to reproduce the issue, and use it to verify the fix.\n\nI will also work with Fellowship to setup e2e tests and regression tests for future releases.

      "content": "Our [last referendum](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/291) was unfortunately rejected in the confirmation period. As it dropped below 50% approval, the referendum went back into the decision period. But the specific referendum already elapsed the allowed decision period of 14 days when it was knocked out of confirmation. A referendum that does not meet the requirements to enter confirmation at the end of its decision period will fail. \n\nWe appreciate everyone that supported us and all the feedback received. 🖤\n\nWe are keen to keep building. To help us get back to work faster we are reducing our asking amount by 20% in this referendum.\n\n**Project:** [Proof of Chaos](https://www.proofofchaos.app/)\n\n**Domain:** Governance Participation\n\n**Beneficiary:** Proof of Chaos Multisig (Go8NpTvzdpfpK1rprXW1tE4TFTHtd2NDJCqZLw5V77GR8r4)\n\n**Requested Amount:** 802KSM ($16842)\n\n**Purpose:** Retroactive Funding + Artist subsidies\n\n**Latest Deliverables:** \n- Bring project to AssetHub (nfts pallet)\n- Make project multi-chain \n\n    - Kusama ✅\n    - Rococo ✅ \n    - Polkadot 🏗️ (voting enabled already)\n    - Parachains 🏗️\n- [Referenda sendout UI](https://www.proofofchaos.app/kusama/referendum-rewards) (ANYONE can mint governance participation NFTs and earn royalties)📈\n- [Voting UI with unique features](https://www.proofofchaos.app/kusama/vote)🗳️\n- Revamped codebase: allows for faster implementation of new features in the future🧑‍💻\n\n*Passing of this proposal is a prerequisite for further implementation of our roadmap (see our full proposal for details).*\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/V2F57xv/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-08-31-32.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/T1w4D4q/Screenshot-2023-10-18-at-13-53-59.png)\n-------\n\nDear Community,\n\nThe Proof of Chaos project is running full steam again. For the past 9 months we worked hard to bring our vision to life. It has been a period of constant learning and pivoting in this fast paced environment. We are very proud of where the project is going and what we have built: **anyone can now mint governance participation rewards and receive royalties whenever they are traded**. \n\nWe demoed this with a [sendout for all voters of Referendum 0](https://t.co/bkkytK5D1U) on Kusama.\nMost of the work done to date has been covered through our last funding round in November of last year. As the future around NFTs was very uncertain at the start of this year we took the strategic decision to run our engine on minimum steam until there was more clarity on the horizon. Through this decision we have been able to stretch our last funding pretty far. \n\nWe did run a bit overboard though (19.2k USD) as we completely revamped our code base. We now have a new site and the new code allows for much quicker and cheaper implementation of new features in the future. For example with the new codebase adding multi-chain support is now very easy. This proposal seeks retroactive funding for those hours and outlines our future roadmap.\n\nWith a period of heavy development to build a solid foundation behind us, we will now also start focusing on marketing our tool. Reward creators currently have to lock up approximately 7KSM per sendout for a referendum of 500 votes. So while they do earn royalties on the trades, in the current market climate it is tough to earn back that amount through trades. In this regard we want to launch a program that reimburses the first 10 reward creators with the amount paid/locked up through their send-outs. We have included a budget of 7KSM*10 to fund the first 10 creators and get things going.\n\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ANXZWZGL19taElFOsMQhUdSR5NdifYzvfqVdTToAHI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n----\n\n### Our Value To the Ecosystem\nOur goal is to bring more participants to on-chain governance on Polkadot and Kusama to secure the network through increased decentralization. Besides governance participation increasing notably since the introduction of our project in gov1, we also achieved doing the following:\n- We recently published a clean UI to allow anyone in the ecosystem to send NFTs as rewards for participating in on chain governance. \n- We work alongside many other ecosystem teams to elevate the whole. We frequently discuss with Parity, Encointer, Kilt and Kodadot to provide feedback and develop ideas in the realm of the Polkadot ecosystem. We are amongst the first builders on the nfts pallet on Assethub for example. Similarly we also created PRs for [Subsquare](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/pull/2298) and [Kodadot](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/pull/7013#issuecomment-1699470842) in the past as we found bugs and built new features for the respective projects.\n- We provide another interface (besides Polkassembly, Subsquare) for voting on OpenGov referenda (currently Kusama + Polkadot, more possible), that works in the browser and on mobile (besides Nova, SubWallet). We think it is important to have different options available.\n- [Our code](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/website) is fully open source. We build with the latest tech and best practices. Our codebase is a valuable example for any current and future builders. Things develop fast and not every aspect of the ecosystem is well documented. In these areas especially using our code as an example will save future builders many hours of reaching out to teams for clarification and pain-staking debugging. We have gone through that process already with various ecosystem teams and through our lessons learnt helped improve documentation as in the example of KILT.\n\n",

      "content": "## Dear Kusama community,\n\n**Allow me to introduce you to our [proposal for 12 Week long Rust academic course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl8aR70PY5LxCUjE9LgncuEQzwT4xZq4kZ-M1_xll18/edit?usp=sharing) held on [Faculty of Informatics and Information technologies, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava](https://www.fiit.stuba.sk/en.html?page_id=749).**\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\n\nThe proposal aims to establish Rust course at Faculty of Informatics and Information technologies in Bratislava. It covers costs of special guests as well as costs for video. The expected outcome is to create an experienced Rust team capable of working on Dotsama ecosystem projects. This will benefit both our University and the ecosystem. Our faculty has an entire research group that focuses on Blockchain. Recently, we had an idea of forming a Rust course. This course aims to gain a team of Rust developers who can help us work on projects and innovations for Dotsama ecosystem. As we know, getting motivated developers into the ecosystem is a very hard task nowadays.\n\n### High-level goals for students\n\n1.  Ability to write custom CLI/server applications using popular crates or to contribute to existing projects\n    \n2.  Get practical, hands-on experience, so that students can create and write their own projects\n    \n3.  Deep dive, intermediate-level Rust skill\n    \n4.  Understand the problems Rust aims to solve\n    \n5.  Ability to judge whether Rust fits project requirements\n    \n6.  Understand why Rust features are the way they are\n    \n\n### Course structure\n\n-   7 modules\n    \n-   12 weeks, 1 lecture of 90 minutes and 1 tutorial of 90 minutes per week\n    \n-   1 exercise set per lecture, to be completed during tutorial or at home\n    \n-   1 final project with a small report to be completed during the mentoring session or at home\n    \n\n**More details on course and each individual lecture can be seen in full proposal document below.**\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n-   Discussion: 9. Oct. 2023 - 15. Oct. 2023\n-   Voting: 16. Sept. 2023 - 29. Oct. 2023\n\n## Documents associated with this proposal:\n\n**[Full proposal (Contains detailed information on course structure)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vl8aR70PY5LxCUjE9LgncuEQzwT4xZq4kZ-M1_xll18/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n[**Delivery document (with Youtube video to lecture, photos of hanged posters at the faculty,  Github repo with all course materials)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s-X9pQEGhotrfbTrLCZo2_MdhOuAE9QvjtzjQGsUzW0/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "## Dear Kusama community,\n\n##  Meet:\n\n![LightSpell logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/251588168-4855abc3-445a-4207-9a65-e891975be62c.png)\n\n### The first 🥇 XCM API in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.\n\n### A project that was awarded [first 🥇 place in Polkadot Hackathon Global Series APAC 2023 held in South Korea](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\n\n### The advantages of LightSpell⚡️ XCM API for developers:\n\n-   Simplified XCM message construction via unified patterns\n-   XCM API reduces call construction time to seconds\n-   Built-in user error prevention for seamless operation\n-   Built-in Token authentication for DDoS prevention\n-   Easy to use tech stack: Typescript, Nest.js, ParaSpell XCM-SDK\n-   Completely free with an MIT license\n-   Also designed for simple private deploy\n-   XCM API handles complex logic and you are only required to provide basic details to create calls (Junctions and other complex details are auto-filled for you)\n-   API Offloads your server from heavy computing required to construct calls (You receive constructed message already)\n-   API saves you server costs (Because of the reason mentioned above)\n-   API features Package-less integration (No need to install anything compared to SDK alternatives)\n-   API is simple to implement (Constructed to be as dev-friendly as possible)\n-   API is already live on the following link: [https://api.lightspell.xyz](https://api.lightspell.xyz)\n\n##  These are our metrics since Sep. 13th 2023 (The day that API went Live)\n\n![Screenshot ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268560462-f0d4aecc-a94c-4be5-8387-5eb729441bf0.png)\n\nWe can see stable growth in requests and unique users. API has been up for 5 days now and we cannot wait to see what it can achieve in 5 months from now.\n\n##  This is how XCM API works\n\n![howapiworks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268458206-27e4b2db-adfa-4fb2-8b47-ba29d8c2162a.gif)\n\nIn the following gif, you can see different XCM calls being created and useful asset query operations (Unique to our API and SDK). These are especially handful for front-end use cases.\n\n## Implementation made easy with our docs\n\nMeet our comprehensive docs covering just about every topic developers will meet with when implementing XCM and our tools into their dAPPs. ![docsgif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268457700-ec761625-1963-46c0-8edc-9e7af3b02c4e.gif)\n\n## Our team and history:\n\n-   By now we completed 4 Web 3 Foundation grants meant to fund the development of our common good tools. This goes to show our dedication to the topic and the community. They can be observed here: [Phase 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1118), [Phase 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1245), [Phase 3](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1589) & [Phase 4](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1817).\n-   The idea of maintenance funding was suggested by Web 3 Foundation here: [Proposal](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1541#issuecomment-1441342524)\n-   We have been granted trust from you - the Kusama community in the following grant which helped us further perfect our XCM SDK: [Grant application ParaSpell XCM SDK Upgrade proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/123)\n-   Our latest achievement is getting 🥇first place at the Polkadot Global Series APAC 2023 Hackathon in the XCM Integration track. [Here is the final announcement post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\n\n**The team behind the project has been hacking in the Polkadot ecosystem for a while now.** The team consists of 2 members:\n\n-   Dušan Morháč: [Recent PBA 2023 Buenos Aires Alumni](https://singular.app/collectibles/statemine/20/12), Building in ecosystem since 2021, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dudo50/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/dudo50)\n-   Michael Absolon: Typescript expert with 2 years of experience, Building in the ecosystem since 2022, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael--absolon/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/michaeldev5)\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\n\nThe proposal aims to aid server costs and maintenance for the 🥇 first XCM API in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Maintaining XCM API also includes maintaining its core component - XCM SDK. These common good tools will be fully maintained for the mentioned period starting on 1st October and ending on 1st February. This proposal allows both tools to remain completely free for the entire Polkadot and Kusama community. It also allows our team to dedicate time to help other teams that wish to implement our tools.\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n-   Discussion: 18. Sept. 2023 - 24. Sept. 2023\n-   Voting: 25. Sept. 2023 - 8. Oct. 2023\n\n## Documents associated with this proposal:\n\n**[Full proposal (Contains detailed information on how we plan to use funds)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HtztfKHQE-r7D5jndN5Tr6Zk5Gy_N4luJdLgdKNeW4w/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n[One pager](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuXF5a0As/ylxqRR43pe3_XRWC27IH-A/edit?utm_content=DAFuXF5a0As&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)\n\n[Documentation for both XCM API & XCM SDK](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\n## Other\n\nOur proposal was discussed on the Kusamarian show episode [AAG66](https://www.youtube.com/live/c_sp7fU7knM?si=6-fsH5FdrvZ_6VMU&t=2918)\n\nWe stopped by to talk about the proposal on the Kusamarian show episode [AAG68](https://www.youtube.com/live/doIhmjTWIBs?si=nKH9JNz8B8uTzKJa&t=1917)\n\n## Delivery\n\nThanks everyone for such amazing support 🤝.

      "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\n_**UPDATE:**_  We decided to go down the big tipper track to keep things simple. See [comment](../post/2600#jhMYwkbfxhpPu7PHt7sD)\n\nSam Elamin from Imbue. We have been very busy since receiving funding from the treasury and have shipped almost all our milestones  \n  \nOne thing we did notice over the past few months has been the tension around treasury spending. We think Imbue is set up perfectly to solve issues around accountability and funding and have built out the Imbue [grants](https://www.imbue.network/blogs/imbue-grants) \n\nWe also did a live demo of it on [AAG](https://twitter.com/thekusamarian/status/1693704945717870736?s=46&t=zgh35N80b7sSgM--juphNw) with our chain on Rococo\n\nWhat we want to do next is do a demo of what this process looks like on Kusama. \n\n**The goal of the demo is to showcase refunds going back into the treasury** \n\nWe will be launching a grant for 10 KSM with 2 milestones\n\n1) Milestone 1 for 1 KSM (10%). This will get approved  \n**2) Milestone 2 for 9 KSM (90%). This will get refunded back to the treasury**\n\nWe have 5 approvers lined up\n\n1.  Giles, an engineer @ parity and part of the fellowship\n2.  Daniel from Parity and part of the SBP\n3.  Bryan: Polkadot fellow and co-founder of Acala\n    \n4.  Sam: Polkadot fellow and co-founder of Imbue Network\n    \n5.  Beatrice: Imbue core team member\n    \n\nA demo like this should ideally be going through the small/big tipper track but that is not currently possible because the treasury — currently - does not support XCM transfers,\n\nWe believe the treasury should support xcm transfers going through the different treasury tracks, this demo will be further evidence of that need\n\nBecause of this we will have to transfer the funds to the parachain soverign account then do a proposal on Imbue to allocate the funds to the grant escrow addres\n\nWe strongly believe this is the best way to ensure accountability and transparency while still remaining flexible enough to support different curators for different grants/projects\n\nKusama was meant for expermintation and to drive innovation, and this is a perfect example of this.\n\nImbue grants was built to solve a key community need, as such we would love your feedback on both this proposed demo as well as how we can best serve the community's requirements",

      "content": "Hello community,\n\nThis is a follow up request for the second allocation of funds from Polkadot Safari 2023 which took place in March and April. \n\n**Excuse the delay for updating this description, I was waiting for my signatories to approve my request for KSM for the decision deposit.**\n\nOur previous request was erroneous (my mistake and I take full accountability). \n\nTL DR\n\nWhen we converted the Kusama received, it was worth $234.127.97, at the time of receipt of the funds, KSM had dropped. Our original total ask between the first and second allocation was $289,313. Due to the depreciation of the Kenya Shilling to the dollar in February, March and April, the funds went a much longer way in covering the costs for the conference. Additionally, a few contributors worked a few hours and we substituted them with new contributors from February. Both of these factors rendered our new difference to decrease from $55,186 to $24,400.\n\nI did not factor that in when I was submitting the referenda two weeks ago.\n\nPlease find our report and request for funds [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNkVSpiFSz1dbwlHUm_dg_F6rie0CpGE7TFXv5AQ1TI/edit). The $24,400 is what's left to pay off the organizer's. We had specifically ensured that we paid off all of the conference expenses before fully paying off ourselves.\n\nThank you for understanding, and may the sky be your basement.  \n  \nSianoi",

To this end, we openly share our operational statistics with the community. This information is readily available at our dedicated portal, https://stats.dwellir.app/. \n\nHere, stakeholders can gain insight into our service to the various Kusama communities. We believe this transparency not only promotes accountability but also underscores our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of service delivery for the communities we serve.\n\n- Our Kusama RPC nodes served on average **3,064,391** requests per day and in total **275,795,145** during the last quarter. \n- Our Statemine RPC nodes served on average **757,182** requests per day and in total **68,146,379** during the last quarter.\n- Our Westmint RPC nodes served on average **102,939** requests per day and in total **9,264,542** during the last quarter.\n\nOur full proposal can be [read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKqYGYYSHl3BBxnb-18Wnog-ML2qbZ9zERqEMrBaVhA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nFor any questions or comments, please write in this thread.\n\n/Team Dwellir",

      "content": "Proponent Address: F7fq1jMmNj5j2jAHcBxgM26JzUn2N4duXu1U4UZNdkfZEPV (parachain 2001)  \nRequested Amount: 50,000 KSM  \nDate: 19.06.2023\n***\nProduct Link: [https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM](https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM)  \nvKSM mechanism: [https://wiki.bifrost.finance/staking-liquidity-protocol-slp/vksm](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/staking-liquidity-protocol-slp/vksm)  \n\n# Summary\n\n[Bifrost](https://bifrost.finance) is a substrate based Kusama and Polkadot parachain that provides non custodial decentralized cross-chain liquid tokens for staked assets. By leveraging on Polkadots cross-consensus message format (XCM) it provides standardized cross-chain liquid staking services for various networks notably Polkadot (vDOT), Kusama (vKSM) and the first LST solutions on both Moonbeam (vGLMR), Moonriver (vMOVR) as well as other multiple chains (currently 6+ chains).\n\nThis proposal would request the Kusama treasury to lend a total of **50,000 KSM (repaid with interest)** as base liquidity for the KSM and vKSM (liquid staking token for KSM) pair.  \n\nThis proposal is identical to **our successful proposal of last year**- for reference [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606)  \nThe execution timeline of the proposal: [https://kusama.subscan.io/treasury/177](https://kusama.subscan.io/treasury/177)  \nThe repayment of last years liquidity loan will happen on the **20th of July, 2023** (1 year following the loan receipt in 2022).\n\nIn terms of Repayment details, before the 20th of July, Bifrost will post under this proposal comment. The general steps will be the following:  \n6/20 | Withdraw vKSM/KSM liquidity from Zenlink and Mangata DEX.  \n6/25 | Initiate Bifrost referendum proposal to redeem borrowed vKSM + one year interest.  \n7/3 | Start KSM unstaking process on Kusama relay chain.  \n7/10 | Gather borrowed KSM + interest in Bifrost Kusama sovereign account.  \n7/11 - 7/20 | Initiate Kusama referendum proposal to repay KSM from Bifrost paraid2001 to Kusama treasury.  \n\n> **Bifrost had done the repayment of the last liquidity subsidy proposal, at July 11th, 2023. Check our latest comment under the last proposal:** https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1606#uyr5UGFRsOIFcPN2olpP\n\n# Why Bifrost?\n\nThis Initial liquidity subsidy is fundamental in keeping the liquidity backing and support for broader utilities and use-cases across various DeFi applications and scenarios within the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystem and driving KSM related economic growth and adoption on both Substrate and EVM parachains.\n\nThis liquidity loan will keep driving the benefits achieved from our previous Kusama treasury liquidity proposal of last year for the broad Kusama ecosystem and for the community (below are **comparisons between last year's proposal and presents in terms of achievements and present developments**):\n\n(**Past**) Provide liquidity for staked KSM and promote the capital utilization of KSM in various DeFi scenarios and applications. This initial liquidity subsidy provides backing to vKSM being a catalyst in driving the expansion of KSM’s multichain economy.\n\n(**Present**) Liquidity subsidy helped us to growth KSM-vKSM capitalizations across:\n- [Zenlink](https://dex.zenlink.pro/#/info/pools/2001-eCSrvaystgdffuJxPVYKf8H8UYnHGNRdVGUvj1SWSiatWMq)\n- [Mangata](https://app.mangata.finance/)\n- [DIA Oracle price feed](https://app.diadata.org/liquid-staking)\n\nOn-going developments and collaborations  (check more details in Section #Motivation - application scenarios)\n- vKSM vault collateral for  Kintsugi kBTC\n- vKSM on Kintsugi DEX for KSM LST Pool (to launch this quarter)\n- vKSM deployment on HydraDX OmniPool (upon Bridge Hub DOT <> KSM completion).\n- vKSM on Pablo AMM on Picasso Kusama (potentially first vKSM/vDOT pair via Composable Polkadot - Picasso Kusama IBC).\n- vKSM as xcvKSM on Moonriver EVM Parachain for native utility:\n-  xcvKSM-xcKSM on Solarbeam DEX \n- xcvKSM as collateral for lending-borrowing on potential protocols such as Moonwell Apollo, Orbiter Finance.\n***\n(**Past**) Bifrost will develop the SLP pallet (vKSM minted pallet) SDK and Stable Asset Pool SDK for cross-chain vKSM mint/redeem calling convenience. The remote SDK call will facilitate cross-chain liquidation for vKSM/KSM.\n\n(**Present**) The vKSM minted pallet has been developed and it is called the “XCM-Action Pallet” in [Bifrost Runtime - XcmAction](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/tree/xcm-action/pallets/xcm-action), it currently works for EVM-compatible chains (Astar and Moonbeam have tested) contract ([https://github.com/bifrost-finance/xcm-action-contracts](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/xcm-action-contracts)) calling vToken minting/redemption/swap to Bifrost via XCM. It wlll be launched expected at the end of July of 2023.\n***\n(**Past**) Further improve the incentives for users to nominate and pledge tokens;\n\n(**Present**) Bifrost has incentivized vKSM, vDOT single-token farming for over a year to drive users to use Bifrost and to deploy vKSM on other parachains and protocols.\n***\n(**Past**) Improve the enthusiasm of KSM holders to participate in staking;\n\n(**Present**) The growth of KSM staked with Bifrost in the past year:\n**from 70’108.1841 KSM to 347'823.6972 KSM with a growth rate of 396.12%**.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/37PNyKc/image-10.png)\n\n***\n(**Past**) Borrow 50’000 KSM from the Treasury and pay back with interest, increasing treasury funds utilization.\n\n(**Present**) Bifrost will repay 54,750 KSM with interest on the 20th of July, 2023. In using this liquidity loan, Bifrost has driven KSM liquidity use cases and continues to do so as mentioned in the section “Application scenarios”.\n\n## The significant improvements of Bifrost in the  past year\n\n- Bifrost Substrate vToken growth in the past year:  \nStimulate vKSM market share and use cases, launch 5 more vTokens: vDOT, vMOVR, vGLMR and vFIL.\n  \n![](https://i.ibb.co/VW5Z9WK/image-8.png)\n\n- XCM V3 improvements on Bifrost  \nThe implementation of XCM V3 on Bifrost replaced many off-chain services for SLP and SALP pallets, which simplified Bifrost’s ability to verify the message status sent to the other chain, streamlining the communication process.  \nLearn more details at: [https://wiki.bifrost.finance/learn/libraries/xcm-v3-in-bifrost](https://wiki.bifrost.finance/learn/libraries/xcm-v3-in-bifrost)\n- Treasury liquidity moved to Zenlink DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5)\n- Treasury liquidity moved to Mangata DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25)  \n\n# Motivation\n\nAs our original intention stated in our first proposal remains unchanged, Bifrosts long-term goal is underpinned by the following objectives:\n\n- Facilitate Capital Flow of KSM staking\n\nKSM, as the governance token of Kusama, about 50% of the total amount of KSM is currently in staking. **Bifrost hopes to activate the capital utilization of staked KSM while empowering the security of the Relay-chain consensus, and promote the activity of Kusama Staking.** Thus, Bifrost has enhanced [liquidity derivative protocol](https://github.com/bifrost-finance/bifrost/tree/develop/pallets/slp) with XCM V3 for Staking KSM: vKSM, a liquid staking token that is anchored 1:1 with staked KSM and comes with KSM staking income. Bifrost hopes to borrow 50,000 KSM from the Kusama Treasury as the base liquidity.\n\n- Enhance the consensus security of Kusama network and reduce the threshold for users to participate in staking\n\nBifrost's KSM liquidity pledge agreement (staking liquidity protocol-SLP) completes the cross chain nominating of KSM by calling XCM at the runtime level, and SLP pallet completely controls and casts vKSM. In the whole process, the SLP protocol selects the validator with no security risk and reasonable rate of return through the governance on the chain to help users complete the one-stop nominate, and complete the final voting through the “[Sequential Phragménd Method](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen#off-chain-phragmen)“ on the Kusama chain. \n\nvKSM validators (108 validators now): [https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM?tab=validators](https://bifrost.app/vstaking/vKSM?tab=validators)\n\nBifrost uses a hybrid mechanism of community governance + automatic scoring to select Validators behind vKSM, making the validator election process diversified, more efficient and transparent.  \nBifrost divides the seats of entrusted validators into two parts, the Validator White List (VWL) and Validator Boost List (VBL). A set of clear validator rating selection rules will generate the former, while the active application of nodes will render the latter and the Bifrost community votes on their application submission for approval. The SLP protocol will only entrust the assets staked by the user to the validators in these two Lists.\n\nVBL Discussions at Bifrost Forum: [https://bifrost.subsquare.io/discussions](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/discussions)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/CVmV89f/image-9.png)\n\nMore details at:   \n[https://bifrost.finance/news/vet-validator-election-track-based-on-bifrost-open-gov-for-the-multichain](https://bifrost.finance/news/vet-validator-election-track-based-on-bifrost-open-gov-for-the-multichain)\n\nIn  Q3 of 2023, Bifrost will launch a governance voting track dedicated to validator elections: Validator Election Track (VET) in conjunction with OpenGov. The VWL and VBL need to pass the VET voting process before officially taking effect.\n\nTherefore, vKSM can help any user willing to stake, complete the pledge without knowledge threshold, and use governance screening to improve the overall staking quality. Staking with mobility will be integrated with rich DeFi scenes to stimulate more users to participate in the nominated proof of stake.\n\n## vKSM utility “implementation plan”\n### Application scenarios\n\nXCM-action: take KSM staking to Multichain\n\nThe function of XCM-Action is to deploy the vToken's mint, redeem, and Swap entry on Multi-chain, making it easier for users from different ecosystems to participate in \"Stake KSM with Bifrost\" or \"Stake DOT with Bifrost\".  \nAt the current stage, XCM-Action has completed several stages of development work:\n\n1. Bifrost XCM-Action Pallet Development;  \n2. XCM-Action Contract and SDK deploy on EVM-compatible chains: Astar and Moonbeam;  \n3. Testing XCM-Action runtime logics with Astar Alpha and Moonbase testnets;  \n\nNext Steps:\n\n- May 2023 | Register xc-vKSM and xc-vDOT on Moonriver and Moonbeam, launch XCM-Action runtime on Moonriver and Moonbeam production.\n\n- May 2023  | List vKSM on Pablo DEX on Picasso and create the first vKSM/vDOT pair using Composables’ Centauri IBC bridge (Polkadot ⇔ Kusama).\n\n- May-June 2023 | Test the cross-chain settlement function of vKSM and vDOT for XCM-Action using DIA vKSM PoR + Market price feed and Astar lending protocol.\n\n- June 2023  | List vKSM on Kintsugi DEX for KSM LST Stablepool and enable vKSM as a new vault type collateral for kBTC.\n\n- June 2023 | Launch the Bifrost xc-vKSM Mint & Redeem page on Moonriver ecosystem, guiding Moonriver ecosystem users to stake KSM directly in the EVM environment without manually cross-chain to Bifrost.\n\n- June 2023  | List xcvKSM on Solarbeam DEX on Moonriver and launch the xcvKSM-xcKSM pool.\n\n- June 2023  | Upon the successful completion of the native Polkadot ⇔ Kusama bridge via Bridge Hub, list vKSM on HydraDX Omnipool.\n\n- June-Aug 2023 | Use price feeds such as  DIA + Chainlink price feed to promote xcvKSM as a lending and borrowing collateral on protocols such as Orbiter Finance, Moonwell Apollo (TBC).\n\n- Aug-Dec 2023 | Enable xcm-action contract and SDK on Ethereum mainnet and L2s (rely on Polkadot ⇔ Ethereum bridge), promote vKSM utilities and Bifrost LSTs Hackathon in Ethereum.\n\n# Proposal\n\n**Amount**:  \nWe apply to borrow 50,000 KSM liquidity subsidy from the Kusama Treasury.\n\n**Liquidity subsidy**:  \nFor a detailed description, please see the section “Liquidity Loan and Repayment Process” below.\n\n## On-chain instruments used to provide liquidity to this proposal  \n1. **Zenlink DEX**   \nZenlink is an underlying cross-chain DEX protocol based on Polkadot, deployed on Bifrost parachain and Moonbeam EVM.  \n\nWhy Zenlink?\n- Bifrost native DEX, provides basic AMM exchange functionality for vKSM native users of Bifrost.\n\nAdditional Information  \nWebsite: [https://zenlink.pro/](https://zenlink.pro/)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/zenlinkpro](https://github.com/zenlinkpro)  \n\n2. **Mangata DEX**  \nMangata is a next-generation DEX that makes tokens from all ecosystems tradable on a single exchange. It features gasless swaps, prevents front-running and MEV without additional fees, and secures the network with the revolutionary proof-of-liquidity consensus.\n\nWhy Mangata?\n- No Front-running/MEV\n- Gasless swaps\n- Proof of Liquidity staking, stake is used as liquidity in Mangata DEX.\n- Liquidity bootstrapping\n\nAdditional Information  \nWebsite: [https://www.mangata.finance/](https://www.mangata.finance/)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/mangata-finance](https://github.com/mangata-finance)  \n\n3. **Kintsugi**  \nKintsugi is a blockchain network that allows bitcoin holders to utilize their assets within the Kusama network. Kintsugi’s kBTC aims to open the value of bitcoin to Kusama by enabling bitcoin based transactions across other Kusama parachains such as Bifrost, Karura, Shiden and Moonriver.\n\nWhy Kintsugi?  \n- Use BTC across Kusama ecosystem\n- vKSM as kBTC valut collateral\n- vKSM as part of the KSM LST pool\n- KSM stakers can utilize kBTC in border DeFi use cases\n\nAdditional Information  \nWebsite: [https://www.interlay.io/kintsugi](https://www.interlay.io/kintsugi)  \nGithub: [https://github.com/interlay](https://github.com/interlay)  \n\n# Managing the funds and Repayment process\n\nTracking Borrowing and Repayment Process\n\nBifrost will complete the borrowing/repayment process of the 50,000 KSM subsidy through a fully open and transparent process on Kusama and Bifrost governance.\n\n**Borrowing Process**\n\n- Kusama side  \n1. Apply to Kusama treasury to borrow 50,000 KSM to the ParaId2001 (F7fq1jMmNj5j2jAHcBxgM26JzUn2N4duXu1U4UZNdkfZEPV) beneficiary through the (Treasury::propose_spend) method of the treasury module on Kusama.\n\n- Bifrost side\n1. Generate Bifrost treasury derived address via Utility::derivative_account_id method;\n2. Through the Tokens::set_balance method, an additional 50,000 KSM will be issued on Bifrost treasury derived address;\n3. Transfer 50,000 KSM from Bifrost treasury derived address to the treasury (eCSrvbA5gGNYdM3UjBNxcBNBqGxtz3SEEfydKragtL4pJ4F) address via the Tokens::force_transfer method;\n4. Mint 25,000 KSM into about 25,000 vKSM via VtokenMinting::mint method;\n5. Add 25,000 KSM and corresponding minted 25,000 vKSM trading pairs to Zenlink and Mangata to provide liquidity.\n- Additional\n1. In the actual transaction, steps 4 and 5 need to be called through the utility.dispatchAs method.\n2. In the actual transaction, steps 1-5 need to be packaged into one transaction through utility.batchAll.\n\n**Repayment process**\n\n- Bifrost side\n1. Remove liquidity from DEXs, retrieve the liquidity of the KSM-vKSM trading pair to the treasury account;\n2. With the VtokenMinting::redeem method, almost 25,000 vKSM is converted back to more than 25,000 KSM;\n3. Transfer 50,000 KSM from Bifrost treasury address to treasury derived address via Tokens::force_transfer method and set_balance to 0;\n4. Transfer 4,750 KSM (one year 50,000 KSM staking rewards from vKSM) from Bifrost Treasury to Bifrost Sovereign account on Kusama via the XCM;\n5. Initiate a proposal on Kusama, repay 54,750 KSM to the Treasury.\n\n- Kusama side\n1. Return roughly 54,750 KSM from ParaId2001 to Kusama treasury address (F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29).\n\nAbout redeem LPs on DEXs:\n\nFor non-Substrate DEXs:  \nSince XCM currently does not support remotely calling Solarbeam's contract from Bifrost to complete the provide/redeem LP operations, Bifrost can only use the multisig solution of Bifrost Council members to operate xcKSM and xcvKSM on Solarbeam.\n\nFor Substrate DEXs:  \nWe will execute though governance via HRMP transactions, below are past cases:  \n- Treasury liquidity moved to Zenlink DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/5)\n- Treasury liquidity moved to Mangata DEX:  \n[https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/post/25)\n",

      "title": "Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Kusama & Statemine (from July to December 2022)",
      "content": "> This is a follow up proposal to what we submitted before: \n> - [Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot & Kusama & Westend & Rococo Networks（until June 30, 2022）](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXSELzfmNH1CP9JbI5Nq1wu8H83vnxJJ22TEjkF2Wgg/edit#heading=h.mja6oa2ekup8)\n> - [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/child_bounty/56](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/child_bounty/56)\n\n\nSubscan is an essential block explorer and analytics tool for the Kusama & Statemine network, providing valuable insights to the Substrate community. However, the maintenance and operation of Subscan requires a significant investment of resources, including server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Therefore, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fee for Subscan from July to December 2022 from the Kusama treasury to ensure its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\n\nWe believe that this reimbursement proposal will help to ensure the continuous operation and maintenance of Subscan, and benefit the growth and development of the Kusama network. This time, we plan to apply for a total of 60,185 USD in Kusama, the amount of KSM will be converted based on the EMA7 price on the day of the official submission.\n\n\nBilling details can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jxQGNpviEkQBA8owGX1j2AyCUeNJ_t9QN-p-7he36E/edit?usp=sharing).\nWe sincerely hope to receive your support or feedback.",

As such we have deferred new developments and claim operational costs only after 50% has been delivered, in an attempt to contribute to improve the cash-flow position of our Treasury.\n\nYou can find all the details in our [detailed proposal](https://pwh.li/ksm23q13pf), and do not hesitate to provide additional feedback.",

      "content": "**Dear Kusama community,**\n\n**This proposal was opened 8 days ago for discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2584)**\n\nAs a sequel to my onboarding as a proposal auditor, (whose referendum was passed [here](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/165)), I’ve conducted audits on a regular basis for Kusama proposals. Some of these audits were in the discussion phase, with others being in the referendum phase. \n\nThis proposal request for the funding of these audit reports using the rate of $50/hour for 2 hours in each proposal. This is in accordance with the OpenCommunity Governance referenda which got passed [here](https://kusama.subsquare.io/treasury/proposal/315). \n\nSince the onboarding period, a total of 9 high-quality audits were made on Kusama treasury proposals. These audits were made using the proposal audit template provided by **Referendum 67** and can be found in [table 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2zVGTl-r81sNwDXjYvCiVGjhZgfi-9ok3rxq4-Alfk/edit#bookmark=kix.c22cdf9jhuud) of this proposal's [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2zVGTl-r81sNwDXjYvCiVGjhZgfi-9ok3rxq4-Alfk/edit#).\n\nThese audits including all previous audits can also be tracked [here](https://airtable.com/shrZVJF7j4l5oUPVu).\n\nHowever, to ensure that this proposal sticks to the “tipper” tracks of the on-chain treasury, only 7 audits will be rewarded at this time. \n\nMore information including the list of the audits for whom a tip is requested can be found in the [proposal document.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y2zVGTl-r81sNwDXjYvCiVGjhZgfi-9ok3rxq4-Alfk/edit#).\n\nThank you!\n\n",

Its targets includes:\n- Implement a group of UI to show business of kusama/polkadot.\n- Engage more developers to dotsama developing in the way of child bounties.\n- Seek ways to facilitate collaborations between projects and external developers in the dotsama ecosystem.\n\nCurrent achivements:\n- Developed and released a site for collaborations in a bounty and child bounty way. Bounty curators can import bounties or child bounties on chain to this site, and external developers can apply them. This bounty site support basic collaboration flows between curators and external developers. Funded by [child bounty #34](https://kusama.subsquare.io/treasury/child-bounty/11_34).\n- [Statescan-v2](https://github.com/opensquare-network/statescan-v2) is developed and released. Now it support polkadot, kusama and several other common good para chains. It's 100% open source. Compared to statescan v1, v2 is more modularized and friendly for collaboration between developers. V2 development work is still not paid due to the market condition.\n- [Bounty #245](https://bounties.opensquare.io/#/network/kusama/bounty/11/child-bounty/245) and [bounty #335](https://bounties.opensquare.io/#/network/kusama/bounty/11/child-bounty/335) are created for identity and vesting pallet business scan. Identity scan child bounty has been awarded, while vesting pallet child bounty is still under developing. 2 external developers are enrolled.\n\n\nPlease check [subsquare](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/215) for more details.",

      "title": "Encointer Lease2 Treasury Proposal 2/2",
      "content": "This is the second of two planned treasury proposals for the current lease of the Encointer common-good parachain. The first share for Q1 and Q2 2023 had been [approved](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/235) by Kusama OpenGov in Dec 2022.\n\nSince the previous proposal, significant changes have occurred around Kusama's Treasury. The implementation of OpenGov resulted in unsustainable spending levels, leading to a restrictive voter backlash aimed at safeguarding the remaining funds in the KSM Treasury. Considering the remaining funds available, Encointer recognizes the need to adapt its funding strategy. Instead of solely proposing to the KSM Treasury, we will now extend our proposals to the DOT Treasury as well, supported by the assertion that Encointer benefits not only Kusama but the entire Dotsama ecosystem. As DOT treasury proposals experience congestion and OpenGov is soon to be implemented on Polkadot, it is imperative to secure uninterrupted funding for our team and prevent any disruptive downramp-upramp scenarios. Therefore, we propose the following measures:\n1. This proposal to the KSM treasury shall cover our expenses for July and Aug 2023\n2. As soon as OpenGov lands on Polkadot, we shall submit a proposal to the \nDOT treasury to cover our expenses from Sept onwards\n\n**The amount of the proposed spend (1.) is CHF 213’000 ≃ USD 234’000**\n\nA growing part of KSM voters is in favor of **retroactive funding** by the treasury. Encointer claims that enforcing retroactive funding for common goods has significant downsides: Asking teams to front the costs themselves in cases where there is no return on investment will keep those teams small and impacts low. Besides Encointer’s established track record, we’d like to emphasize that the founder of Encointer, Alain Brenzikofer, has worked for Encointer without pay from the beginning, which amounts to well above a person-year by now. So, if you insist on retroactive funding, please consider approving this proposal on the grounds of Alain’s pre-investment. \n\n[Detailed proposal Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lUVpmTjE81_rwBR38H80rSiwYd3eoPZHE6TGykwlsSo/edit?usp=sharing)\n",

      "content": "Polkassembly is an integral part of polkadot and kusama governance. This submission proposes a recurring payment (quarterly) to cover maintenance, operations and human resource costs for Polkassembly, including general maintenance, runtime upgrades changes and could/infrastructure cost. This submission covers costs for April, May, June of 2023. The maintenance proposal alternates between Polkadot & Kusama treasury and we are requesting the Kusama treasury to provide funds this time.\n\nThis recurring proposal aims to secure the continuous operation and sustainability of Polkassembly, a vital component of Polkadot and Kusama governance.\n\nTo ensure the smooth functioning of Polkassembly, we request a recurring quarterly payment to cover essential expenses such as maintenance, operations, and human resources. The funds are allocated towards general maintenance, runtime upgrades, and infrastructure costs, guaranteeing the reliability and efficiency of Polkassembly.\n\nSpecifically, this submission addresses the funding requirements for the months of April, May, and June in 2023. As part of the alternating maintenance proposal between the Polkadot and Kusama treasuries, we kindly request the Kusama treasury to provide the necessary funding for this period.\n\nAttached below are key highlights of our proposal: \n\n- **Customization**: Implementing a customizable and dynamic notification engine across multiple platforms (mail, telegram, slack, discord) to enable users to receive personalized notifications.\n- **Preview Images**: Creating identifiable proposal preview images at the chain level, making it easier for users to interact with hyperlinks.\n- **Anti-Spam Features**: Allowing users to flag spam proposals and comments, with warnings displayed on the UI and moderation team action taken within 24-48 hours.\n- **Partnerships**: Integrating the option to build custom quizzes for proposers, collaborating with Proof of Chaos team to reward correct answers with NFTs. Partnering with Grill chat and Subsocial Team to facilitate anonymous on-chain communication.\n- **Content & Education**: Establishing a dedicated webpage for blogs, tweets, and digests from Polkassembly to keep users updated on initiatives.\n- **Audit**: Creating an audit section for proposals, enabling auditors to reach a wider audience by adding their audit links to proposals.\n- **Site-wide Improvements**: Enhancing discussion post linking for better community engagement. Providing edit history for proposals and comments, allowing users to report problematic comments. Adding on-chain events to the calendar, leveraging Polkascan's APIs and allowing filtering by chain level. Enabling image upload in posts and comments for user convenience. Implementing comment sentiment upgrades to view overall sentiment and filter comments accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe full proposal is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_JYFNEV8Y5l5bzs79zD5u--go225vhsfuXuzMNXrDH8/edit).\n\n",

In response to this, we are resubmitting the same proposal.\n\nThe events occurred as follows, aligned with the relevant block numbers:\n\n1. Block [#17860314](https://kusama.subscan.io/block/17860314?tab=event&event=17860314-2): The referendum was confirmed and approved (Refer to Event Details for more information). Upon confirmation, the proposal was programmed for enactment at block #17874714, which is 100 blocks later following the established protocol.\n\n2. After 100 blocks referenda was enacted and went into the Scheduler\n\n3. Block [#17863651](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/17863651-6): At this point, the preimage was unnoted. This action interfered with the scheduled execution of the referendum.\n\n4. Block #17874714: The proposal was set to be enacted at this block by Scheduler in the next treasury spending period. However, with the preimage being unnoted prematurely, the system was left with just a hash and no accompanying instructions for enactment.\n\nBig thanks to Raul for his assistance in identifying the source of this error. \n\nIn light of the unsuccessful enactment of the previously approved proposal, it has been decided to resubmit the proposal as a new referendum. All parts of the proposal stayed the same except the update of KSM EMA7 to $25.52.\n\nThe failure in enactment was due to an oversight on my part, and I take full responsibility for this mistake. I kindly request the community's continued support as we resubmit the proposal. \n\n\n\n[Full proposal](https://github.com/CoinStudioDOT/OpenGov/blob/c850956f861c062a2124ab1224b248fe459de582/Documents/%23203%20OpenCommunity%20Governance%20Proposal.pdf)\n\n",

      "content": "This is a follow-up proposal on [Referendum 170](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/170).\n\nSince we originally created the retroactive Parasnaps maintenance proposal, the market experienced a significant downturn from the EMA7 specified in the proposal (KSMUSD @ $31.345). Despite accounting for some market volatility and 5% slippage in the proposal, the resulting difference between our costs and the payout is large in this case and therefore, we would like to follow up with this proposal.\n\nPlease find here a screenshot showing our sale of the KSM at a price of $24.75. This proposal is to cover the remaining $5748.15, or 223.02 KSM at an EMA7 of $25.774 for KSMUSD.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yfFT7Fj.png)\n\n\nWe would also like to address one concern that was raised in our previous proposal regarding providing snapshot only for Polkadot. During the entire time that the Parasnaps service was live, we provided daily snapshots for both paritydb and rocksdb on the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains. Unfortunately, we cannot prove this through the Wayback Machine, but would appreciate if those that used the service could vouch for our statement.",

This is a continuation of the [Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88).\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC in a no-std environment. An RPC client is a library, with similar features as Polkadot-js. With an RPC client developers can easily interact with any Polkadot or Kusama chain. There are RPC clients for different programming languages. For Rust, the most popular RPC client is subxt. Subxt uses the Rust standard library (std). The Rust standard library is not available in certain environments, such as trusted execution environments (like IntelSGX) or certain IoT devices. The substrate-api-client bridges this gap,  providing a library that can be used in such environments.\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the treasury proposal [Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88). View our [report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88#agl5qxkd9WZSVyBV2G9Y) for details on our work there. We aim to seek ongoing funding. Since the funds of the Kusama treasury are currently limited, and many projects ask for funding, we decided to make a smaller proposal and focus on changes that are needed due to substrate updates.\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2566) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZyGcRs9pvks_FCm5B0BO1sikZIsJjAYeJCuehL7jyQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details.\n",

      "content": "**Proponent:** ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP (OnFinality)\n\n**Date:** 8th May 2023\n\n**Requested:**  1,835.806 KSM (USD: $51,971.31)\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\n**Full Report:** [Kusama Q1 2023 Full Report/Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Raw Data:** [Kusama Data Q1 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kLH15a_iPl8F-DmDnYekGlDxnj3zx_-0FP3Meb3bKP8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* * * * *\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (January, February, March 2023) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing reliable infrastructure services\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how nodes are running, what calls are causing errors, and where traffic is originating from\n\n## Service Details\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, we've made a large number of stability improvements to our Ultimate API service to allow us to add a large number of new parachains over the last quarter as well as support for multiple chains outside of Polkadot.\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we've been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. Geolocation insights provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now automatically upsize the storage on nodes to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they've all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Substrate chains.\n\nBetween 2023-01-01 and 2023-03-31 our Kusama API service has:\n\n-   Served a total of 2.08 billion responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 43,000 GB of data egress \n\n-   The highest daily total was 62 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Kusama only\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 33 million responses each day\n\n-   Stateme had over 190 million API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Polkadot is 40,919,737,864 (nearly 41 billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Kusama and Statemine was 99.96% and 99.99% respectively\n\n## Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [Auto Expand Storage](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-developer-update-auto-expand-storage-for-dedicated-nodes/) - When the node's storage reaches 85% utilisation, the storage size will be automatically increased by 10%. Saves developers and devOps time on having to constantly check on and manually upgrade their node storage size\n\n-   [Partnership with POKT network](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-partners-with-pocket-network-to-unlock-access-to-unstoppable-infrastructure/) to bring in more external developers into the Polkadot ecosystem\n\n-   [Geographical Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) - API key owners can view statistics about where in the world your community are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives\n\n-   [Clarify our IP address handling](https://blog.onfinality.io/how-does-onfinality-deal-with-personal-information/) - OnFinality does not, and will never, correlate or link specific wallet addresses to the IP address or request origin making the RPC request\n\n-   We're testing access to various unsafe methods like traceBlock and subscribeStorage that will help developers create applications that utilise XCM - contact us if you would like to be part of the beta\n\n-   Reduced our exposure to any single cloud provider - Progressively migrated resources away from AWS to other cloud providers for lower cost and exposure.\n\n-   Expanded our OnFinality for Startups Programme to support teams from the Substrate Builders Programme and Scytale Ventures\n\n-   Added support for a number of new networks, including Ajuna, Unique, Clover, SORA, Composable Finance, Collectives, xx network, as well as Polygon, BNB, Fantom, Gnosis and Evmos from outside the ecosystem. OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/) and [network analytics page](https://onfinality.io/networks).\n\n**Full report can be read here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing)",

Existing snapshots solution took around ~40 minutes to Download and our solution allowed to restore a validator in a couple of minutes.\n\n### Central Topic:\nParasnaps was launched in February 2022, this proposal aims to cover the costs and work generated by Parasnaps from August 2022 until its decommissioning in March 2023\n\n### Future Proposals:\nWith warp sync in its current state, we believe Parasnaps is no longer required and has been decommissioned in March 2023.\n\n\nPlease find the full proposal [here](https://hackmd.io/@tugytur/SyLCDyhfn).",

      "content": "![](https://i.postimg.cc/8CHcKfsr/Group-1187.png)\n\n\n***SUMMARY***\n\nDeStore aims to revolutionise the e-commerce industry by enabling businesses to tokenize real-world assets and create multi-resource Digital Twins that have utility in both In Real Life (IRL), Virtual Reality (VR), and Augmented Reality, (AR) environments. Our core objective is to bridge the gap between traditional e-commerce and the new age of blockchain-based Digital Twins, unlocking new possibilities for growth and expansion.\n\nWe are not just an e-commerce platform; we are a dedicated phygital asset marketplace that is paving the way for the future of e-commerce, where the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds are erased, and anything is possible. Our business maintains the core principles of decentralization, security, and transparency; With a vision of enabling brands to be self-sovereign and trade outside the traditional banking sector. \n\nIn preparation for the Kusama Hoodie Trial, which was approved in our first proposal to the Kusama Council and Treasury [(Motion 562)](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/562), we have been gaining valuable insights and have prepared ourselves to move forward with dropshipping trials. This trial helped us collect data on how to build out a scalable solution for the Polkadot ecosystem, it has given us the ability to establish numerous partnerships, and has allowed us to implement significant changes to our platform in order to enhance its performance and functionality. However, we faced multiple challenges during the trial and ran out of time and funds, as our initial proposal was for a period of 3 to 6 months.\n\nThus, we are proposing some changes to our previous proposal, and presenting a new proposal to achieve our vision. With this new proposal, we are pursuing an additional 6 months and funding of $ 150,396 USD from the Kusama treasury. This budget will enable us to continue developing and refining the platform, to research logic around physical products with a Digital Twin and conduct further community trials with products or merchandise supplied or donated by the brands.\n\n\n**With this proposal accepted, we plan to achieve:**\n\n1. Deployment on 4 Substrate based chains.\n2. Logistical, technical, and marketing support for 4 chains.\n3. Support up to 15 SMEs/DAOs, to the ability to sell and distribute phygital products on the Parachains that they choose.\n4. Release the XR Kusama hoodie wearable instead of the initial regular hoodie.\nCreate DeStore Network API for Wallets, Centralised and Decentralised exchanges to connect to, and sell products on each connected chain. \n\nThis new proposal represents a significant step towards creating a decentralised app store and payment system that will revolutionise the way we interact with physical products.\n\n\n**Read the full Proposal 2.0**: [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LnVrMx3NR4MYqxYc558zbCFU4gzm3uNWJmAKofAFadQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nLink to Discussion 2.0: [Link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2552)\n\n\nLink to original Proposal 1.0: [Link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/562)\n\nLink to original Discussion 1.0: [Link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1810) \n\n",

Details of these audits can be found in [Table 1 of this proposal's document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PeGpwRv0gBTklsEpihJvvFMGXog2MmPUIPKzUgKKikM/edit#bookmark=kix.c22cdf9jhuud)\n\n**Getting onboarded as an auditor is the primary aim of this proposal, but the KSM value that will be tipped on this proposal is a token of gratitude for the audit work done so far. (At a rate of 1KSM/audit for a total of 10 audits, details of which are in the proposal document)**\n\nDetails of the proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PeGpwRv0gBTklsEpihJvvFMGXog2MmPUIPKzUgKKikM/edit#). \n\nThank you!",

      "content": "**Context**\n\nWe are a team of academic specialists from [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) (which has a [parachain of the same name](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/explorer) on Kusama) led by Professor Alexander Kapitonov, one of the founders of the project.\nWe have set a goal to create comprehensive and illustrative educational materials for a wide audience with zero or initial knowledge of web3 technologies.\n\nAn explanation of our goals and lecture speech sample is also available on YouTube:\nhttps://youtu.be/WlGDvLHmbqE\n\n**Problem**\n\nResearch has shown that the existing courses dedicated to cryptocurrencies and web3, despite their sufficient elaboration, concentrate either on the financial component or are intended exclusively for developers. Courses dedicated to basic information about blockchain and web3, although they clearly explain the concept, do not give the potential user information about what values ​​and benefits he will get using decentralized applications. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nOur proposal is to create a course for those who see the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem for the first time. We plan to take several parachains that solve common web2 tasks and show these cases in video lectures and supporting text materials. A feature of the course will be the integral presentation of information with demonstration of real projects and everyday examples. We want to show ordinary users how basic knowledge of technology makes their life and everyday tasks safer and more convenient. \n\nWe plan to take several Kusama projects that solve regular web2 tasks, and show these cases in video lectures. Good candidates Statemine, Robonomics, Moonriver, Remark, Crust, Basilisk. We plan to release two variants of the course: on the Kusama mainnet and on the Rococo testnet. During the course the participants will use a combination of parachains to pass a task that will be evaluated by simple learning management system dapp.\n\nDeliverables: YouTube video lectures, GitHub texts and source code, dapp with learning management system elements.\n\n**Requested Amount**\n\nThe project is designed for 5 months and requests a total of 27 572,5$ (843 KSM).\n \n**Full Proposal**\n\nMore details are available in [the full proposal](https://crustipfs.art/ipfs/QmSgQbsSaT4he6BBtaGe3KwyjzZTRMM2FN6g9GCg32Xv3m).\n\nFeel free to share your opinion about the proposal. We consider feedback to be one of the key indicators of our project.",

      "content": "**Proposal**:\n\nA Simplified Thread on Twitter about Kusama. The thread will be a basic overview for beginners.\n\n**Why Is This Needed?**\n\nKusama can be extremely overwhelming, especially for new users outside DOT/KUSAMA. \n\nThis will save them time understanding Kusama and what it is attempting to accomplish.\n\n**How Much Time Will Be Spent Writing This Thread? (Roughly)**\n\n- Research: 20 Hours?\n- Creating Custom Diagrams & Material: 4 Hours?\n- Writing Twitter Thread: 3 Hours?\n\n- Total Time: ~30 Hours\n\n**How Much Compensation Is Being Requested?**\n\nSince the estimate is 30 hours of work, the requested amount for this proposal is **0 KSM**. This is not a typo. **ZERO KSM**. \n\n(For the proposal I had to type in a value greater than 0, so I typed in 0.0001 KSM. The Beneficiary Account is the Treasury.)\n\n**What's The Catch?**\n\nThere is none.\n\n**Why Post A Proposal Then?**\n\nWanted to create a proposal that was too good to reject.\n\n**How Do We Know The Thread Will Be Professional And Not Trolling?**\n\nSimplify DeFi aims to simplify and educate. This thread will be an ever-green resource to help the audience understand KSM and save time researching.\n\n**Who The Heck.....Are You?**\n\nSimplify DeFi :)\n\nTwitter: ~9K Followers\nYT: ~5K Subs\n\n**Examples of Recent Threads & Videos?**\n\n- Radix Overview [Half a Million Impressions, ~1.5K Likes, ~300 RTs. Note: Radix did promote this thread on Twitter]:\n\n- [https://twitter.com/SimplifyDeFi/status/1637588791010504705?s=20](url)\n\n- [https://youtu.be/YItyFcYaQ20](url)\n\n- FVM Overview [250K+ Impressions, 1K Likes, 300+ RTs]:\n\n- [https://twitter.com/SimplifyDeFi/status/1630506923140284417?s=20](url)\n\n- Thena Overview [60K Impressions, 122 Likes, 40 RTs]:\n\n- [https://twitter.com/SimplifyDeFi/status/1625345157787688960?s=20](url)\n \n**CONCLUSION:**\nKusama can be extremely overwhelming for people outside the community.\n\nThis thread will be a great resource to provide a simplified overview of Kusama and what it is attempting to accomplish.\n\nFor an estimated amount of 30 Hours of work and 0 KSM (**ZERO KSM**), hopefully this proposal is a no-brainer :)",

      "title": "OpenBrush 8-9, 11-12 milestones development (WASM smart contracts)",
      "content": "Dear Kusama Community,\n\nWe would like to share the proposal for the development of 8-9 and 11-12 milestones of [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)\n\n\nYou can check initial discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2522).\n\nThe price was calculated by EMA7 rate on the date of proposal submission, so the calculations were the following:\n235200 / 2 / 34.541 = 3404.64954692 KSM\n\n### TL;DR\nThe purpose of this proposal is to grow the emerging **WASM smart contracts field**, by developing core infrastructure product **OpenBrush**.  \nAs Gavin mentioned in this [CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now/) article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. Also, as was mentioned in the approved [WASM smart contracts bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1491) currently smart contracts parachains lead the ecosystem in terms of market adoption. \nHowever, despite WASM tech having a lot to offer, it's not being widely used at the moment simply because of lack of proper tooling and ecosystem infrastructure products\n\n**OpenBrush** is a core infrastructure product, a starting point, and a base for every ink! dApp. 12 production-grade teams and 3 parachains currently use OpenBrush. This proposal is a continuation of the development of the successful product, proposing the most developer-needed features, validated by market feedback.   \n\n### Context\n\nRight now Polkadot ecosystem has a lack of Polkadot native dApps as most of them running are just forks of already existing things on Ethereum network. We already have such unique features as XCMP and WASM smart contracts, but the entrance threshold is too high since there are not much tools to help newcomers use them.\n\nOur team at [Brushfam](https://brushfam.io/) is committed to creating a developer-friendly ecosystem for ink! smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Based on the data we believe that our products, including [OpenBrush](https://github.com/727-Ventures/openbrush-contracts), [Sol2Ink](https://github.com/727-Ventures/sol2ink), and [Typechain-Polkadot](https://github.com/727-Ventures/typechain-polkadot), have become the starting point for every smart contract developer entering the ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\nWe would like to share our proposal for the development of 8-9 and 11-12 milestones of [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)(10th milestone was implemented in [separate grant ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OySc-dNTBWTF768GOLiPgh4plE1kkO2wI37z-hXvy78/edit)and covered by AlephZero). OpenBrush is a base library for ink! smart contracts. It provides standard contracts (based on PSP), as well as useful contract implementations and macros to help you build ink! smart contracts. \n\n### Roadmap\nWe talked with smart contracts parachains (Astar, AlephZero, Phala) and companies using OpenBrush and have prepared following roadmap for the next milestones of OpenBrush: \n- Creation of educational materials for ink! smart contract developers, designed for both newcomers and advanced developers.\n- Establishment of new standards for smart contracts in Polkadot, with a focus on new NFT standard, and implementation of these standards as part of OpenBrush.\n- Adoption of a chain extension approach in our work.\n- Contribution to the development of ink! smart contract language.\n- Introduction of new features to make OpenBrush more flexible.\n\nWe are committed to achieving these objectives and believe that they will help drive the growth and adoption of ink! smart contracts in Polkadot.\n\n### Full Proposal\nFor more information on our proposal, including a detailed roadmap, please see the following link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b49juyKJN0W-UBHoJ4iS3P_I0Z5a94YoNLxylIf-As8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b49juyKJN0W-UBHoJ4iS3P_I0Z5a94YoNLxylIf-As8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThank you for your consideration, and we look forward to your support!",

      "content": "**Proponent:** Db4xRxFBsvMSBN5qWmmt9CWQdHt6gXSGuroh8JhU1q6ys45\n\n**Date:** 6 March 2023\n\n**Requested KSM:** 1012.9419\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for 2022, for the running of public-good SubQuery Dictionary Projects which serve pre-computed indexes of each block for most Polkadot and Kusama parachains. These public projects enable the parachain teams and teams within their ecosystem to increase the data indexing speed of their SubQuery projects by up to 10 times.\n\n**Raw Data:** <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17829KgXp5aXKXkaPw7A7oCgjMBB8vEuCg2Pyk1MGQnY/edit#gid=0>\n\n**Full Proposal:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginal Motivation\n===================================\n\nSubQuery is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Kusama, and other layer-1 chains in Substrate, Avalanche, Algorand, Terra, NEAR, and Cosmos projects, we provide data for developers to use for a wide array of projects (wallets, explorers, custom chains, or any other decentralised app). In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.\n\nThroughout the whole of 2022 (01/01/2022 - 31/12/2022) we've provided public SubQuery Projects, termed Dictionaries, for most parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem to dramatically increase indexing performance (up to 10x faster) and so far these dictionaries have served over 1 billion requests.\n\nA SubQuery dictionary is a special SubQuery Project which scans over the network, and records metadata of every event and extrinsic on each block. When other SubQuery projects index data on any of these chains, they can ask the dictionary what blocks a filtered list of events/intrinsics appear on. Rather than having to search through each block, dictionaries reduce the amount of data that the indexer obtains from the chain, reduces load on free RPC endpoints across the ecosystem, and reduces the number of \"unwanted\" blocks stored in the local buffer. For example, instead of SubQuery inspecting each block of Polkadot's massive chain (600GB of unstructured data on over 12 million blocks) which can take many hours, dictionaries skip through to the exact right blocks.\n\nAdding the dictionary  to optimise indexing performance is as easy as adding the relevant network dictionary endpoint to your SubQuery Project. This has been added by default to all of our starter projects to make it default to use.\n\nHere you can find detailed documentation on how dictionaries work: <https://academy.subquery.network/academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.html#>\n\nSubQuery Dictionaries have been created for most parachains to the public here <https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary> and have been deployed to our Managed Service. If any other team would like a dictionary created - we are more than happy to help out.\n\nFuture Targets for Our Dictionaries\n===================================\n\n-   We're proud of our record on stability and reliability. One of our core values is to be blockchain's most reliable indexer, and we don't intend to lose sight of this as we onboard more chains and expand the number of customers relying on our hosted service for their production applications. Our goal for 2023 is 99.99% uptime, we're starting off strong with 100% so far as seen [here](https://status.subquery.network/uptime/f3j5qtmn4rhd).\n\n-   Through 2022 we ran 24 dictionaries for the in-demand parachains that we believed would add most value to the dApp developers in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Moving forward we want to be able to offer the increased indexing performance to all active block-producing parachains, our goal will be to add 20 more dictionaries to our suite of tools in 2023.\n\n-   Being on the cusp of 1 billion requests to our dictionaries in 2022 has left us hungry to smash records in 2023. This year, with the launch of our decentralised SubQuery Network and ongoing Business Development efforts, we are looking to hit (and surpass) a target of 10 billion requests to our dictionaries.\n\nGithub Contributors. Our [dictionaries are completely open source](https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary), and SubQuery is a community project with a goal of complete decentralisation. Already last year, we welcomed contributions to our dictionaries from developers at Nodle and Subscan. We are working on making it easier for new parachains to assist us with creating dictionaries.\n\n--\n\n**Full Proposal Found Here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Treasury Proposal - Substrate in Bits",
      "content": "**Dear community,**\n\n\nWith the aim of supporting ecosystem developers, I'm presenting this treasury proposal for \"Substrate in Bits\", a series of in-depth technical content focused on addressing the pain points of developers building with Substrate. \n\nThis proposal has been up for discussion for **9 days** [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2530)\n\nThe goal is to provide valuable and comprehensive resources that can help developers understand their code better as well as serve as a trusted reference for developers seeking to gain an in-depth understanding of how their codes work.\n\nEach article in the series will be written with the goal of providing detailed information and practical examples with the ultimate goal of serving as a trusted reference for the common problems logged on Substrate media platforms like the StackExchange, Polkadot Discord server, Substrate Matrix channel, etc.\nBy breaking down complex Substrate concepts into “bits” that are easy to understand and implement, we aim to make it easy for developers to gain a deeper understanding of their code and be able to make proper changes when things go wrong. \n\n<br>**Substrate in Bits**</br>\n\n<br>**Problem:**</br>\n- The depth and specificity of community-created content needs to be improved.\n- The developer community needs more reference resources that target specific pain points of developers.\n- The ecosystem needs more community-curated technical content that can easily evolve over time by  eventually leveraging the expertise and contributions of a diverse community of engineers.\n\n[Jump to the Problem section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.rtx22oudlknz)\n\n<br>**Available solutions**</br>\n\nThere are some existing solutions for substrate-related resources (Including the Substrate documentation and Blockchain training Alliance course) and some are in the works (eg, Polkadot.study). But a key different between \"Substrate in Bits\" and these solutions is that the technical content in “Substrate in Bits” are not designed to be specific courses. Instead, they’re designed to address specific issues often faced by developers. \n\nA key component of addressing these issues and creating technical content, is consulting with experts and getting their opinion (this is a core component of our research process). \n\n[Jump to available solutions section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.o7vbzgqhvmxu)\n\n\n\n<br>**Proposed solution**</br>\nThis proposal aims to tackle the existing problems by:\n- Creating technical content using a problem-based approach. The goal of these “Substrate in Bits” is to address common issues faced by substrate developers and go in-depth on why these problems arise and how to solve/avoid them. \n- Making technical content as collaborative as possible, allowing engineers from the community to make contributions and make Substrate in Bits an up-to-date and trusted reference for substrate developers. In order to achieve this, all our technical content will be housed on GitHub. This will make it easy for interested contributors to contribute to improving these pieces of content in the future.\n\nBy compiling these information in one easily accessible location, developers can more quickly and effectively troubleshoot their code and gain a deeper understanding of Substrate's technical components.\n\nThis will not only save developers time and effort but making the content open-source on Github contribute to the growth and success of the Substrate ecosystem by encouraging greater participation and collaboration.\n\n[Jump to the Proposed solution section of the Proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.4zgqeocu4ug5)\n\n\n\n<br>**Scope of work and Deliverables**</br>\nThe key deliverable for this proposal is 40 pieces of \"Substrate in Bits\" content. Priorities will ultimately be given to issues that are logged more often on substrate channels and the stackexchange and have less available solutions. These pieces of content will be housed on Github\n\nOther efforts that are not part of the key deliverable include:\n- Monthly analytics of our content and the living survey to gauge impact\n- Efforts at bringing \"Substrate in Bits\" into the limelight of developers\n- Running a \"Substrate in Bits\" channels where developers can brainstorm on \"Substrate in Bits\" content\n\n[Jump to the Key deliverables section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.z2q1mv7r6x4g)\n\n\n\n<br>**Key success criteria**</br>\n- Developer reach: \n     - Target: 100\n- Percentage of developers that participated at least once in our living survey\n     - Target: 30% - 50%\n- Developers’ perception of our content\n    - Target: >70% of readers should find our content to be helpful and satisfactory\n\n[Jump to the success criteria section of the proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.wxgz8ueb2o7u)\n\n\n<br>You can find the full information in the [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit?usp=sharing)</br>\n\n\nOriginal discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2530)\n",

      "content": "#####  **Proponent**\nHi, everyone!\nThis is a proposal from [Web3alert.io](https://web3alert.io/kusama) to cover the maintenance costs and further development of Kusama and Polkadot integrations throughout the entirety of 2023.  \nWeb3alert is a notification service that helps one track on-chain events and calls on Kusama and Polkadot and sends notifications whenever these events/calls occur. Web3alert can track on-chain events or calls, the notifications sent are customisable, and also it supports Telegram, Slack, and Discord as receiving channels. \n\n#####  **Requested KSM:**  \n545 KSM = 17 712 EUR (based on [EMA 7 ~ Subscan](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) on 21 Mar, 2023).  \n#####  **Short description:**  \nWeb3alert.io maintenance costs for Kusama and Polkadot integrations at the rate of 600 EUR/month (+ VAT) per network for the period from 01.01.2023 to 01.01.2024\nProposal covers the maintenance of both networks, and will alternate between treasuries.\n\n#####  **History**\nAbout 6 months ago, we [received funds](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/176) for the maintenance of Kusama integration in Web3alert, and since that we: \n- kept back-end updated for new runtimes\n- maintained high uptime of service for all 6 months\n- [added Slack](https://medium.com/@web3alert/slack-as-a-new-receiving-channel-f84f31699992) as a notifications channel\n- [added Governance-2](https://medium.com/@web3alert/kusama-governance-v2-notifications-14359fcc50c2) into Simple mode templates. \n- [integrated Statemint](https://web3alert.io/statemint-kusama) for the both networks. \n- started work on [user documentation](https://docs.web3alert.io/). \n\n#####  **Our plans for 2023**:\n- control of the code relevance and current/future functions compatibility with the latest versions of Kusama and Polkadot.\n- general development of Kusama and Polkadot integrations - new features, fixes of possible bugs\n\nThe discussion is [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2453).\n\nYou can find the full proposal, reports, motivation, and budget [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zu1_S1S8U2HPKHm0Sg7FOjm9SxYfh4D1OmJoXZt2mXY).  \nThank you!\n\n",

      "content": "Submission date: 13.3.2023 ([discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2491) date: 27.2.2023) <br/>\nRequested allocation: 6,533.71 KSM (**210 kUSD**, based on EMA7 by Subscan 1KSM = 32.141 )\n\n<br/>\n\n**Polkagate extension** is a user-friendly extension/wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser. The extension allows users to access their Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps. It injects a @polkadot/api signer into a page, along with any associated accounts.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/BannersArtboard%201.jpg)\n\nPolkagate is now available on [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ginchbkmljhldofnbjabmeophlhdldgp?authuser=3&hl=en), [Mozilla Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/polkagate/), and [Microsoft Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/polkagate-the-gateway-to/eakellaeidmgcpifaofebhpcjienkajp) web stores for download.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/BannersArtboard%203.jpg)\n\nPolkagate extension’s main supported functionalities, developed in **milestone 1**, are as follows:\n\n- Add address only accounts (To be used as a watch only and proxied address)\n- Contribute to Crowdloans (View contributions/auctions, and contribute to crowdloans)\n- Export/Import/Derive account(s)\n- Ledger support\n- Parachain accounts\n- Phishing website detection\n- Pool staking (Fully supported, including pool management and owners exit facilities)\n- Proxy management (Add/Remove proxy accounts, sign with proxy accounts)\n- QR account import\n- Solo staking (Fully supported, including fast unstake, reward history, and advanced settings)\n- Support different remote nodes\n- Switch to recent chains\n- Transfer funds\n- View balances (Crypto/USD)\n- View transactions history\n- View an address as a QR code\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/BannersArtboard%202.jpg)\n\nPolkagate team aims to provide additional new features, and **the budget is requested for the development of the 2nd milestone**:\n\nAfter the delivery of milestone 1 of the PolkaGate extension with the above mentioned features, We are going to develop the **milestone 2** of the proposal to add the following features to the PolkaGate extension:\n\n**1. Identity management**: Identities exist on-chain but cannot be managed via the extension, we already have shown the identity for accounts, but we want to bring the full management of identities into the extension. Accounts’ names in the extension may differ from their on-chain identities, and this may be inconvenient to distinguish which identity belongs to which name/Id. This problem will be more for users with multiple accounts. Moreover, in social account recovery, when you lose your account, most probably you cannot remember the address, hence on-chain names come in handy! By integrating the identity management into the extension, users not only can easily set their identities but also request judgements using the extension. In addition, using the on-chain identity instead of the local name of accounts, makes the accounts management more convenient. Identities also help social recovery be more user-friendly for users. \n\n**2. OpenGov**: We would like to have OpenGov features in the extension so that most token holders of the community can easily participate in new governance activities. OpenGov is new with more changes in the pipeline (v2.5). Community involvement is still low in openGov activities. Sometimes proposals are very technical, and sometimes users may not be available in the voting period to vote. Making voting more accessible and providing vote/list delegation besides all governance facilities in Polkagate extension, will increase the tokens participated in different OpenGov voting activities. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/polkagate/for%20stores/Governance%20V0.1%20(1).png)\n\n**3. Light client integration**: We would like to provide the Polkadot light client as an end point in the extension, which will make the extension much more standalone, and help the ecosystem to be more decentralized. If blockchain endpoints stop servicing for whatever reason, since no data can be fetched from them, hence all extensions and wallets would be useless. Integrating the light client inside the extension not only helps to distribute the Polkadot ecosystem more but also lets the extension operate while all existing endpoints stop servicing. However, we need to consider the sync waiting time when using the light client.\n\n**4. Social Recovery**: Managing your own private keys is a difficult task. The average person doesn’t want to spend multiple hours to ensure the security of their keys. This leads to people having difficulties to join the blockchain space or even worse leads to the loss of funds. Social account recovery is the solution. It allows users to recover their accounts if their key or other authentication mechanism has been lost. When an account is recoverable, if you lost the account, you can create a new account named Rescuer, and recover your lost account with the help of your lost account’s on-chain friends in a recovery process.\n\n**5. Misc. updates:** Due to adding new features in milestone 2, some new functionalities need to be added to the currently existing features, and pages need to be upgraded. With vote locking in openGov, the extension’s account page needs to be upgraded to show locks information and let account holders to clear the locks, and also show suitable alerts when locks expire. With vote delegation, we are going to let users have the option to choose un-delegation while unstaking, to have the unlocking period overlapped not stacked. To support XCM, we want to add multi chain transfering to the transfer fund page to let users teleport their tokens.\n\n\nPlease find the **full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IOe8dNXycpu4RTmktVBeH9RAV-QW3jeUTHPxMw2rp6M/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThe discussion link on PA: [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2491)",

We will change the packaging. The ones we tested are too flexible. 20/04/2023 \\*\\*Significant milestone\\*\\* We started the production of the papercraft. 2/4 designs of the papercraft finished. Meanwhile we are finishing the instructions. We are trying to make the assemble as easy as possible. 24/04/2023 Printing and precuting the templates. Slow process. We are already way over the hours we planned in the proposal, but we've come up with some good ideas to make the assemble less difficult. 26/04/2023 4/4 of the designing templates completed. Minting completed. 27/04/2023 Production of the templates finished 02/05/2023 Made a linktr.ee. Working on educational files. Changing the packaging design to fit a new harder envelope (300g) 10/05/2023 There were some issues with the package printer, so we are looking for another one. That could take 10 days. We just contact other suppliers and boughts some tests. 15/05/2023 Instructions and educational files done.",

      "content": "**Short description**: Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable data indexing infrastructure for most of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem (and growing).\n \n**Raw data**: [Archive Infrastructure metrics -October, November, December](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU7QoRiF7Y3HRpR5eQEKBlf17DhLVous_csyEo__G1cGMnEClcn2ckJpaVtkILTrAmdbZHb2Dqp422/pubhtml)\n \n**Requested KSM**: 3,594.64 KSM\n \n**Previous proposal**\nhttps://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/246\n \n# Motivation\nArchives are an important piece of Polkadot and Kusama data infrastructure provided by Subsquid. They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains getting support as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\n \n# Achievements\nOver the course of Q4, Subsquid released incremental upgrades to the SDK, including:\n -  improvements to the TypeScript boilerplate code generator\n - direct support for polkadotJS types bundle format\n - improvements to substrate metadata parsing\n - support for oddYParity for signature parsing in EIP1559 and EIP2930 transactions\n - Deployed new Archives, expanding the list of available networks to 48\nFurthermore, the team has been researching impactful positive changes that have been, or will be released over the course of Q1 2023, as well as ameliorations to the command line tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Statistics\n[Daily queries average](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU7QoRiF7Y3HRpR5eQEKBlf17DhLVous_csyEo__G1cGMnEClcn2ckJpaVtkILTrAmdbZHb2Dqp422/pubchart?oid=565272683&format=interactive)\n\n\nThe data collection pipeline has undergone some changes, and because of this, there are some gaps in the available data (which also influence the weekly moving average in red).\nWith that being said, it is reasonable to assume a linear trend, and the red line represents a linear regression estimation of total queries over time. The gaps in the collected data are visible as \"flattened\" sections of the blue line in the chart: \n\n[Total queries](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRU7QoRiF7Y3HRpR5eQEKBlf17DhLVous_csyEo__G1cGMnEClcn2ckJpaVtkILTrAmdbZHb2Dqp422/pubchart?oid=1449674255&format=interactive)\n\nUnder this assumption, we can extrapolate these key metrics about Subsquid's Archive infrastructure, over the course of Q4 2023:\n - served a total of 128,567,499 (~128.5 million) queries\n - The highest daily total was 1,832,412 responses in a single 24 hour period\n - The daily queries (both instantly measured, and the weekly window average) confirm a growing trend towards the end of the year, only partly due to the deployment of some new Archives\n\nFull report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQvG5iX9We1LNq6Xpk0UiIGwFnO5BhX63JYYeUtqox9zgzePivJ-7NEOw42tPOHg3Xhti_ohCGLeq5U/pub)\n\n",

We’re on a time crunch and have done all of the marketing organically through Twitter Spaces with teams such as Astar Network, Unique Network, Subsocial and many more.  The conference will take place in the breathtaking location of Naivasha, just 2 hours from the capital city Nairobi. Transport to and from Naivasha will be covered for attendees. With plenty options of accommodation along the same road of the venue.  This idyllic setting offers a unique barefoot networking experience, surrounded by stunning wildlife, and breathtaking scenery at the shores of Lake Naivasha.\n\nKenya has a proven track record of embracing tech innovation, and it is ranked among the top countries globally for crypto and blockchain adoption. In 2021, Kenya was ranked 5th globally for crypto adoption, and 19th in 2022.   As the home of the world’s most ubiquitous mobile payments technology, MPESA, the country's forward-thinking approach to technology makes it an ideal location to host a conference that promotes the benefits of Polkadot and Kusama.  **This conference will equally have a Pan-African appeal, with confirmed attendance from Polkadot Ambassadors in Nigeria, Uganda, Rwanda, Madagascar, and other nations**.\n\nWe aim to bring together individuals and organizations from all over Africa to learn about and explore the opportunities within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.  Polkadot and Kusama aim to provide a scalable and interoperable network that enables seamless communication between different blockchain systems. By hosting the first ever Polkadot conference in Kenya, **we hope to raise awareness of the benefits of this technology and attract new developers, community builders, and users to the ecosystem both locally and in the continent**. \n\nThe conference will bring together developers, researchers, media, investors, and other stakeholders to experience the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, share knowledge, and discover new collaboration opportunities.  **This event truly aligns with Polkadot's roadmap of promoting education and engagement**, and it will provide a platform for showcasing the progress that has been made towards the ultimate goal of creating a decentralized and interoperable network for a new web.\n\nThe unique setting of Naivasha will provide an unforgettable backdrop for networking and exchanging ideas, and attendees will have the opportunity to enjoy the area's natural beauty.  **We have nearly 200 signups for the bootckathon, 87 for speakers, 11 different parachain and ecosystem teams, and 65 local and Africa-wide scholars to be sponsored to attend the hackathon**. During writing this proposal, we have discovered parachain teams from Africa and can’t wait to meet them.\n\nYou can access our **detailed proposal** via the [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F5j1PTZJ7KTnfEl8nS7lkktDE3-ZG4xq3e2IUxENndA/edit) provided.\n\nFollow us on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/safaridao/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thesafaridao?s=21&t=trML2hSMjEjrMlpHYvDYcg) for updates.\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. It's linked to this [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2435).\n\nBest regards, \n\nSianoi and the SafariDAO team.",

Only funders get to vote on the progress of a project since they have the most to lose, while project initiators are incentivised to continue delivering so they get more of their project’s funds unlocked.\n\nWhat we want to build is a platform where creatives, developers, researchers and anyone with talent can utilize their expertise to get paid securely and safely regardless of where they are in the world. To give people options that do not exist where they live and get funded in whatever substrate native token they wish\n\nWe believe this resonates strongly with the ethos of Kusama, and will be a great outlet to bridge over other ecosystems that can leverage Imbue and hence Kusama as a vehicle to achieve their dreams or improve their lives. Thereby pushing more adoption onto Kusama and definitively answering the popular misconception that Web3 lacks utility\n\nThe team reached out to the community and described what we wanted to do. A promise was set that - given the team's expertise to deliver on this - there will be no external funding until a usable product is produced. We decided to build it in an open-source manner with volunteers\n\nImbue is one of the very few(GM perhaps being the only other) that remains to this day open source and not funded with the sole purpose of protecting the community. As such, the team are also exploring ways to migrate towards a common good chain\n\nWe strongly believe that Imbue can add much-needed utility and value to Kusama beyond just DeFi, as well as help us reach beyond the Polkadot ecosystem and clearly and definitively answer \"Why Kusama?\" or \"How does this make my life better?\" and bring in users and adoption\n\nPlease feel free to look at the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-zlnNZ5zD9wZhNf-Prb3a5zv_HW_7aYrfcNBmPg9I4/edit?usp=sharing) and we look forward to your feedback",

      "title": "Subledgr is a platform for multi-token fund management, accounting & reporting",
      "content": "### General Project Information\n\n**Short description**: Subledgr is a platform for multi-token fund management, accounting & reporting (Phase 1)\n\n**Project Category / Type**:\n- Software development (applications, tools)\n- Miscellaneous (research, services)\n\n\n**Proponent**: derek // metaspan.com\n\n**KSM address:** HyLisujX7Cr6D7xzb6qadFdedLt8hmArB6ZVGJ6xsCUHqmx METASPAN\n\n**Requested allocation**: 1,430 KSM (~£50k @ £35/KSM 21-Feb-2023, EMA7 for KSM/USD, EMA7 for USD/GBP, ref. Budget section for full details)\n\n**Discussion date**: 31 Jan 2023 (discussion)\n\n### Problem Statement\n\n- **Multi-chain, multi-account** - Most users hold and manage tokens across multiple chains, and use different accounts for custody and control (e.g. stash & controller for staking/nomination). Account holders & fund managers do not have affordable tools focused on financial management, reporting and planning.\n\n- **New processes** - Fund and Grant Management is a niche area requiring specialist attention. Managing a fund-in-a-fund is common practice, and we need a toolset to support this.\n\\\nGovernance processes are evolving fast, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. We need aggregated tracking and accounting for funds locked in validating, staking, nomination pools, lending & governance processes (proposal, bounty, childBounty).\n\n- **Lagging tools slow adoption** - Users are mostly dependent on web2 tools and spreadsheets for financial management and reporting. These tools are focused on fiat with 2-decimal computation & reporting.\n\n- **Affordability** - Existing crypto accounting tools are charging large fees.\n\n- **Parachains** - None of the existing solutions cater for parachains.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe goal of the project is to create easy-to-use tools for managing & reporting - in aggregate - across multiple chains and tokens.\n\nSubledgr would like to develop a quickbooks style accounting & reporting platform that can be tied-in with third party vendor tools for the purposes of tax calculation and compliance.\n\nSubledgr would also provide portfolio management and reporting features for working with multiple chains and accounts. We are inspired [and frustrated] by similar features from quickbooks/xero for web2 SME businesses. Following a style that is familiar to web2 users, this site will drive adoption of substrate-based tokens by making it easy to manage groups of wallets as a single fund.\n\n### Key deliverables\n\n- The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Phase 1 of Subledgr's roadmap includes the following features:\nReport on all transactions/extrinsics: Subledgr will provide a report on all transactions and extrinsics that have occurred on the blockchain, giving users a complete view of their cryptocurrency activities.\n\n- Categories: Transactions such as transfers between accounts, staking rewards, bond amounts, and fees will be allocated based on the user’s defined Chart of Accounts. This will help users better understand and analyse their cryptocurrency activities.\n\n- Categorisation - the basic feature that enables “bank” reconciliation and subsequent reporting \n\n- Profit & Loss: Subledgr will produce a Profit & Loss report for a specified period (e.g. week, month, year), including information on the movement of tokens earned and spent, as well as changes in exchange rates (e.g. GBP/USD).\n\n- Exchange rates: integration with an oracle for exchange rates\n\n- Export to CSV/spreadsheet: Subledgr will allow users to export their data to a CSV or spreadsheet format. This will provide a basis for any tax reporting or other financial analysis.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nA user of the system will be able to execute the following processes:\n- Login, User management & password recovery\n- Create portfolio(s)\n- Add accounts to a portfolio\n- Review all transactions for the accounts from chain / indexer\n- Allocate transactions and fees to categories\n- Report on\n  - Fund (Portfolio) Value\n- Extract transactions to CSV\n\n### Additional info\n\\\n==> see original polkassembly posting and discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2413)\n\\\n==> LINK TO FULL PROPOSAL [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F79YMx5B5qGB3N8AlPD9r7UYW4WcH-AECFNIb6BmnA/edit#heading=h.d1jf1dgpau8)\n",

      "content": "The discussion prior to proposal [link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2474)\n\n**On behalf of our team**, we propose the creation of a ParaSpell XCM SDK & XCM UI Maintenance Bounty that will work to aid team that have been previously **funded by the Basilisk Parachain team** and **the Web3 Foundation** which also proposed the idea of Treasury Bounty funding for this project here: [link](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1541#issuecomment-1441342524) \n\nMore information on project funding and achievements can be found in our official docs: [link](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/#project-achievements-so-far)\n\nThis bounty is for maintaining infrastructure and performing continued operations to improve SDK in many useful ways mentioned in our application document below.\n\nHence, the Maintenance Bounty is meant to be open-ended, with the funds being distributed through child bounties that cover work for team that will take care of the continued development of the essential infrastructure. The following proposed child bounties contain mainly the recurring tasks for checking XCM support, resolving issues raised by developers, and implementing new ideas that could further improve already very useful XCM SDK and UI. \n\nWe believe that this tool is needed in this ecosystem and we are working very hard to prove this. Unification can bring ease of integration and speed of dApp development significantly. This Polkadot forum post goes to show, that developers actively search for such tool. [link](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/grant-ideas-and-wishlists/399)\n\n\n**Links for repositories:**\n\nSDK - [link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\nOrganization with all repos - [link](https://github.com/paraspell)\n\n**Further information** on the bounty mechanism, management of the funds and budget can be found in the [bounty proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gykciv8lIEmgXYoyHg1QY_Z9l_rKrzzbocP0PuhP81Q/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Testing Treasurer Track - Close Bounties & Slashing Tips",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\n**Summary:**  This proposal seeks to test the Treasurer's origin in its ability to cancel bounties and slash tips.  The bounties are SPAM and the tipping system is no longer receiving the attention of the Council.  If these actions are successful I am seeking a payout of 32 KSM (8 KSM per item) for use with my public staking rewards payout bot.\n\n**Details:** The Treasurer track has been used to primarily fund recipients using `treasury.spend()`; it has also been used to fund and assign curators to bounties.  I would like to further test its ability to close two SPAMMY bounties entitled \"[Catching #KSM Scams And Buying And Burning Rug Nfts](https://kusama.subscan.io/bounty/17)\" and \"[Help Bring The Ruggables Real Governance](https://kusama.subscan.io/bounty/18)\".  I would also like to test use of an extrinsic that hasn't been used often, `tip.slashTip()`, this extrinsic removes a tip and slashes the user's deposit (0.033 KSM x 2) returning it to the treasury.  These are items of house keeping and it is best administered by the public in an open and collective manner.\n\nAs a reward, I am proposing a payout of 32 KSM (8KSM x 4) made payable to an account used by my public KSM staking rewards payout bot.  Rewards are divided into two independent branches, 16 KSM if both bounties are indeed closed and another possible 16 KSM if both tips are slashed.  If neither extrinsic is successful then no reward would be issued.\n\nRegards,",

      "title": "Customized Kusama Chocolate Bars",
      "content": "**CUSTOMIZED KUSAMA CHOCOLATE BARS** \n\n**1.General Project Information** \n\n**Short description:**  customized chocolate bars to make Kusama tangible and to give it a touch of lifestyle\n\n\n\n**2. Context** \n\nAfter having a short discussion about this idea with Bill at Polkadot decoded last June, he gave me confidence to try to propose this idea here at the Kusama treasury.\n\nThe motivation for this idea comes from the digital nature of blockchain making it hard to grasp in the analogue world and hence not being tangible. The logo and branding of Kusama or Polkadot should be present on daily goods to make it easier for users to connect emotionally not only visually, but for example also through flavor, sound, or touch. I believe giving Kusama or Polkadot a touch of lifestyle would be a great differentiator to other blockchains out there and in the digital world, with all its noise it’s very hard to stand out only with nice branding and logos on social media.\n\n\n**3.Problem** \n\nWhat all the blockchain projects out there have in common, is that they only market and brand themselves in the digital world, but not in the analogue real world. The attention span on social media is very short and with all the noise it’s very hard for users to connect emotionally to a blockchain project, except if they are token holders, fan boys/girls, or team members of the project.\nHow can we attract new users to Polkadot/Kusama and keep existing users connected and attracted to Polkadot/Kusama, without digital marketing methods like air drops, online quizzes, virtual meetings, NFT drops, or online ads on social media?\n\nI guess that one method which has proven itself in the last year to make users get emotionally attached to Polkadot, are real life events like Decoded or Sub0. Merchandise is also a good tool, but unfortunately it lacks creativity and by now we probably all have enough black t-shirts with a boring text logo in standard font in our wardrobe. \n\nProducing real world lifestyle products for Kusama/Polkadot should help with brand awareness and long term connectivity to new users and existing users, who value physical products that can be experienced through touch, taste, visual appearance, scent and hence motivate user to interact with Kusama/Polkadot and use the provided tools like staking, governance, minting NFTs, community growth, etc.\n\n**4.Proposal** \n\nKusama/Polkadot branded chocolate bars with custom packaging design to promote Kusama and Polkadot and other parachains with QR codes for example. These chocolate gift boxes can be used for:\n\nKusama/Polkadot gift tool (https://gifts.kusama.network/#/): receiver of gifted KSM/DOT can chose to receive the chocolate gift box by providing an address\nRegular attendees of Meet Up’s or Twitter spaces who prove attendance with POAP’s\nBusiness partners or investors to make them aware of projects building on top of Kusama/Polkadot\nGive away on real life events like Polkadot Decoded to special guests, supporters or volunteers\n\n\n**4.8. Key deliverables** \n\nGraphic design for product packaging\nProduction of chocolate bars with custom packaging\nShipping to various partners: Parity, W3F, Parachains\nDistribution of product at events\nCollecting and analyzing feedback of users\n\n**4.9. Objectives/Success criteria** \n\nWhen the product is successfully produced, packaging design is matching the digital draft, partners are receiving their batches and users are having a smile on their faces after trying the chocolate, then we know that goals were achieved!\n\n\n--> **see original polkassembly posting and discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2406)** \n\n--> **COPY OF LINK TO FULL PROPOSAL [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vn8IP-YyvTWWDvzMI6JJIDn_ZAVSi9OC/view?usp=share_link)** \n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n**1st update on 11th of March 2023:**\n\n- funds were received form treasury and transferred to exchanged to convert to €\n- payment to graphic designer of 13KSM (~$500) was transferred \n- requested and received various graphic elements from W3F, which were not publicly available\n- design for chocolate box and chocolate bars is in final stage\n- unfortunately the selection of chocolate flavour is not as wide as initially believed ([see poll](https://tinyurl.com/bd2x8937)) and according to the supplier, they can only offer flavours which are [regularly produced on the line](https://www.zotter.at/eigene-edition/ihre-firmenschokoladen/handgeschoepfte-schokolade)\n\n--------------------\n**2nd and final update on 2nd of May 2023:**\n\n- 100 pieces of chocolate boxes were shipped and received today\n- costs for production were paid (invoice available in shared folder)\n- all the design files are available in shared folder (proof of work of graphic designer)\n- proof of payment for graphic designer available as screen shot in shared folder \n- preparation and shipment of boxes to users happening now\n- shared folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-3tZwa9H9PcxEEkxkBModP8kjrfcJw4?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k-3tZwa9H9PcxEEkxkBModP8kjrfcJw4?usp=sharing)\n\nenjoy the yummy Polkadot/Kusama chocolate!!!\n",

      "content": "Hello all,\n\nThe [Proof of Chaos project](https://www.proofofchaos.app/) aims to incentivise governance participation. \n\nIn order to track the effectiveness of our efforts, we built a [Kusama Governance Dashboard](https://www.kusamagovernance.com/). With the launch of OpenGov we are now looking to extend the dashboard to also include all relevant data from this new governance system.\n\n<br>\n\n---------\n\n<br>\n\nWe are asking for a total of **31.889 €** for the undertaking. \n\nThrough our [last proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/54) we have been overpaid 4.160 € (due to KSM price increasing during voting period) which we discounted in this proposal. We will only be asking for 70% of the funds up front and 30% after completion to ensure accountability on our part.\n\n**31.889 € - 4.160 € = 27.729 €**\n\n<br>\n\n---------\n\n<br>\n\n\n<h3>Asking amounts of each proposal:</h3>\n\n**Up-front** payment through **proposal 1**: 27.729 € * 0,7 = 19.410 € => 669 KSM (10% price buffer)\n\n**Post-delivery** payment through **proposal 2**: 27.729 € * 0,3 = 8.319 €\n\n<br>\n\n---------\n\n<br>\n\nAny excess funds (due to a KSM price increase between referenda creation and payout) will be paid back to the treasury! This includes the price buffer of course.\n\nYou can find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZRdGw7-sE0um9DjpMFdUjqW4soU4hLD_MO2nU9xroE/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nView the original discussion post [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2405).\n\n",

We must educate a generation of users who are passionate about sharing their knowledge and insights in order to establish this new paradigm in content creation.\n\nWe must totally distinguish our methodology from the way of working of influencers and marketing agencies, which always end up influencing the message and objective of the content generated by the creators they support, resulting in pieces with commercial or speculative claims.\n\nWith the work carried out by Creadores Web3 and all similar groups in this early stage of the ecosystem, in addition to rewarding with tips the generation of valuable content by users who carry out this activity more sporadically, we must prepare users and teams who want to formalize a personal brand or a brand of a podcast, informative website, etc. so that they can be truly competitive, learn how to define their content series and how to give them visibility.\n\nHere is the link to the **[full version of the proposal in english](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoOflWHmQER-luWqQ29mw6JRbaINerV9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111991717794509596698&rtpof=true&sd=true)** \n\nLink to **[Proposal Discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2156)**\n\n**[Creadores Web3 activity report\n](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189_GKlV7tDzVuRQI6WGQ_8oIiyhxoEZb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111991717794509596698&rtpof=true&sd=true)** (02/08/2022 - 02/12/2022)\n\n**Spanish**\n\nEsta propuesta de 6 meses es para renovar el financiamiento de Creadores Web3, un grupo de creadores de contenido y usuarios de la comunidad de habla hispana formado en WagMedia bajo Bounty 12.\n\nExiste una necesidad real de formar y educar a una generación de creadores de contenido competitivos que sean usuarios nativos del ecosistema de Polkadot y Kusama.\n\nCon esta propuesta nuestro objetivo principal no es sólo continuar revisando y recompensando la creación de contenido de valor para la comunidad.\n\nNo debemos pagar por la generación de \"un número X de piezas de contenido\", si no usar los recursos otorgados a esta iniciativa, y todas las similares, para educar a una generación de creadores, usuarios reales de esta tecnología, que puedan ser competitivos en las plataformas que operan, todo mientras siguen generando un contenido de valor para el futuro del ecosistema.\n\nLa labor realizada por estas iniciativas y lo que supone toda esta nueva forma de financiación para la creación de contenido debe consolidarse. Debemos educar a una generación de usuarios apasionados por compartir su conocimiento y puntos de vista para así establecer este nuevo paradigma en la creación de contenido. \n\nDebemos distinguir nuestra metodología totalmente con la forma de trabajar de las agencias de influencers y marketing, las cuales siempre acaban influyendo en el mensaje y objetivo del contenido generado por los creadores que amparan resultando en piezas con pretensiones comerciales o especulativas.\n\nCon el trabajo realizado por Creadores Web3 y todos los grupos similares en este estado temprano del ecosistema, además de recompensar con tips la generación de contenido de valor por usuarios que realizan esta actividad de forma más esporádica, debemos preparar a usuarios y equipos que quieran formalizar una marca personal o una marca de un podcast, web informativa, etc. para que ellos puedan ser competitivos de verdad, aprendan a definir sus series de contenido y cómo darles visibilidad. \n\nAquí tenéis el enlace a la **[versión completa de la propuesta en español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPA5TsnHAuHh-7oVxzwQoYxKIAJx17b4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111991717794509596698&rtpof=true&sd=true).**\n\nA continuación tenéis un vídeo donde explicamos algunos de los puntos más importantes de esta propuesta: \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8BMAJwfbjI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

      "title": "Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23",
      "content": "We'd like to fund maintenance of the [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) from February 2023 until April 2023. This is a continuation of the [Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov-22 to Jan-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26).\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC. It is an alternative to subxt, which provides a similar functionality. RPC clients are needed in any software component, connecting to a substrate parachain. Therefore it is advisable, that there is more than one client available for Rust developers. Apart from that, the substrate-api-client fills a gap, providing the possibility to create extrinsics in a no_std-environment. Thereby facilitating extrinsic creation from within trusted hardware (like Intel sgx). This has a big potential for further usage in IoT environments. Last but not least, the substrate-api-client has an easy-to-use interface and comes with many practical examples, which makes it a good option for new developers.\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the treasury proposal [maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov22 - Jan 23](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/26). View our [report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26#cbace6d7-a2aa-4053-b9a3-9ba948f151e2) for details on our work there. We aim to seek ongoing funding. At the current stage, we want to work on improvements of the existing functionality and providing examples for using the client in different use cases. Furthermore, we want to start the implementation of a cli-wallet with password encrypted keystore.\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2159) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A25Sq4tr3HXB6WUj5vJP0EhC9enGZraGLh8CQpoB7GQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details.",

Compared to previous proposals, this time we are leaving out the development of out *hardware wallet prototype* and the implementation of the *Local Incentives Protocol* to have a narrower focus, a shorter timeline and smaller team to give the community a better feeling of how the team works and what it can accomplish.\n\nVirto is a technical team of creative people aiming to become a mini \"Latin American Parity\" , focusing on creating user-friendly technology and tools to bring Polkadot technology to the masses. Our team's long term vision is to reduce social inequality and improve the efficient allocation of public resources by empowering local communities with autonomous micro-economies through our *Local Incentives Protocol* (Not part of this proposal).\n\nWe are proposing to build a developer-friendly stack that brings the best of two decentralized ecosystems together, Substrate and Matrix, to create impactful infrastructure that empowers individuals and communities through user-friendly Web3 tools with minimal to no friction for the end user. We expect this technology to bring a whole new wave of users to the Kusama ecosystem that have no previous background or knowledge about blockchain or cryptocurrencies.\n\n### Links\n\n* [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sh5w-d-0tiQjBg1nPj-9cl5LFFZ3s_M-9bl0Dko7y2Q/edit?usp=sharing)\n* [Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1og1OMHyP4oarnK6inE9TrdYaOKltstT-DC6WExnsYq8/edit?usp=sharing)\n* VirtoLIVE: [#2](https://youtu.be/wk-NWqBktV4) [#1](https://youtu.be/mX3_RcKsJvQ)\n\n## Progress updates\n\nThe team aims to follow a 2 week sprint cycle where every sprint is closed with a VirtoLIVE(might not be live) that serves as a demo day.\n\n- **Sprint #1 - feb 20-mar 6**: \n  - Libwallet.js and Sube.js **[highlight]**: We created JS bindings of our client libraries while still making breaking changes to the API \n  - Super app: On boarding to [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com), our chosen front-end framework\n  - Valor: Planning the re-write of our PoC runtime to be embedded friendly and built around [WASI](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI) with its upcoming component model.\n- **Sprint #2 - mar 6-20**:\n  - [Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/8d1e99ced7064ca695e4ba7b3541d8d4) working of Sube.js and Wallet.js sending transactions in the browser\n  - App: integrating matrix rust sdk and troubleshooting issues with room synchronization.\n  - Valor: Using Embassy the async runtime for embedded(desktop and WASM too) integrated with a WebAssebly abstraction to run WASI plugins in different platforms.   \n- **Sprint #3 - mar 20-apr 3**:\n  - After researching how we could build on top of the [Conduit homeserver](https://conduit.rs) as initially proposed we concluded that we can't really use it as the base of our WASM centric homeserver, \n  therefore we will be starting a new homeserver implementation called **[emma](https://github.com/virto-network/emma) from scratch**. Matrix homeservers are extensive multi-year developments\n  but we plan to get to a PoC stage by the end of this proposal. \n  - The team if gaining speed with Rust, our junior, mid and senior developers didn't have Rust experience before but are getting more comfortable with the language over time after several sessions of pair programming and assisted problem resolution.  \n- **Sprint #4 - apr 3 - 17**:  \n  - Initial set up of [ksm.community](ksm.community) where we will host a dedicated Matrix homeserver and an instance of our \"super app\" to be used as test ground were we can showcase the Virto stack to the Kusama community.\n  - [WIP](https://github.com/virto-network/sube/issues/28#issuecomment-1496307094) aligning Sube's Rust API with its JS version exposing a simple single `sube!` macro that can be used for both querying and submitting transactions to the blockchain.\n  - [Merged](https://github.com/virto-network/libwallet/pull/30) still experimental API of the JavaScript version of libwallet + fix WASM compilation issues. \n  - Valor: solving execution of multiple concurrent WASM plugins in a single threaded environment\n- **Sprint #5 - apr 17 -may 1**: ([goals of the sprint](https://matrix.to/#/!hjjaLvBFZianunvUCO:virto.community/$CTcvIwqCAABQ-7TodF93GrF1Tacddc_sCIeV-X1j7_U?via=virto.community&via=matrix.org))\n  - PoC server exposing `.well-known` Matrix endpoint compiled to `wasm-wasi`, used to test a possible interface between the Valor runtime and WASM plugins and to kick-start the development of our future homeserver [emma](https://github.com/virto-network/emma)(embedded matrix)\n  - Our experimental [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com) based Matrix client can join rooms, send, receive messages and get notifications.\n  - More Rust learning and sharing taking place within the team. \n- **Sprint #6 - may 1 - 15**: ([goals of the sprint](https://matrix.to/#/!hjjaLvBFZianunvUCO:virto.community/$WH5CrrafiXg2PbiIX14JCFEQlM4I8KDvTUxxDnT3yFo?via=virto.community&via=matrix.org))\n  - Draft plugin interface, in other words, define the simplest way developers can create applications(Valor plugins) in the Virto ecosystem.\n  -  Work in progress about integrating a \"timeline\" abstraction in the Matrix client to efficiently fetch text messages, also improve styles while final design is defined.\n\n... following updates can be seen in our YT channel or in #dev:virto.community pinned messages",

      "title": "Governance 2.0 Referenda Audits",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nBased on the recent experience with the increasing number of treasury proposals, I am presenting the following proposal aiming to improve the Governance 2.0 experience through a series of referenda proposal audits.\n\n[The original discussion.](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2138)\n\n**Governance 2.0 Referenda Audits**\n\n**1. Problem**\n\nSince the launch of Governance 2.0 on Kusama I spent many hours reading, reviewing, and trying to understand many treasury discussions and proposals. I try my best to understand every proposal before forming an opinion and voting. For the majority of the proposals, I try to provide feedback to the proposer explaining the reasons for either supporting or rejecting the proposal. So far I feel like proposals are sort of a wild game at the moment.\n\nMost proposals are not very well structured, lack information, and include budgets that seem very hard to defend. Proposals can also be very diverse with a focus on different areas that not everyone can be familiar with. For all these reasons it is significantly time-consuming for voters to truly understand the proposal and cast an educated vote on it.\n\nWith the given time constraints, it is not surprising that proposals are receiving very little or no feedback at all. The feedback is often provided in a free form and is not always clear and precise. Such insufficient information has little use for other voters. It provides low assurance to other community members that the reviewer has objectively formed an objective opinion on the presented proposals.\n\n**2. Available solutions**\n\nThe official Polkadot treasury page, Kusama and Polkadot Wiki provide a good source of information and documentation. Most of this information and guidelines explain the “old” Governance 1.0 system or in other words, it relates to the very specific set of proposal reviewers – Councilors. With the Governance 2.0 introduction, the set of reviewers dramatically increased from a limited set of councilors to a much wider Dotsama community. For this reason, all the documentation needs to be adjusted so it can be better presented to the wider audience where not everyone needs to be an expert in the field to have a good understanding of the proposal content.\n\n**3. Proposal Solution**\n\nThis proposal aims to create a clear and precise framework for creating and presenting the proposals. This framework is not meant to be a strict requirement but more as a set of guidelines for the proposers to successfully present their project and increase their chance to defend the proposal and win community approval.\n\nAs the counterpart to the proposal framework, the equally important audit framework will be created as guidance for the reviewers. This audit aims to provide more precise feedback to the proposer and give a sufficient and educated review that can be later used by other voters to form their opinion on the proposal.\n\nIn a young system like this, creating these guidelines is simply not enough. To create a better treasury proposal system, a great level of engagement is required. For this reason, I propose a temporary Project manager/auditor role for a period of 3 months. The main task of the PM is to actively follow the governance tracks, objectively check and audit the proposal content according to the proposal guidelines and produce and publish the audit according to the created framework. The task of the PM is to be available to the community and gather feedback and accordingly adjust the framework.\n\n**4. Key deliverables:**\n\nProposal template – a document with predefined categories and as many pre-filled and guided data (examples) as possible.\n\nFeedback template – directly related to the proposal template. Possible checklist for each category with additional room for the feedback\n\nProduce a minimum of 30 one-page audits with included feedback on active treasury proposals or proposal discussions\n\n**5. Key objectives/ Success criteria**\n\nReduce the time required to write a detailed and comprehensive proposal – measured by the proposal owner's feedback\n\nHigher community involvement in the governance – measured by the number of members involved in discussions, number of provided feedback, and number of interactions with one-page reviews\n\nAll these points are taken from the full proposal document.\n\n[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ze8Z_f9Pa3kjALGnhu-58DNdajFQ74ONbuDeWcaFoU/edit#heading=h.5x0d5h95i329)\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "AIWeb3 Chinese Unit proposal (爱Web3 中文社区提案)",
      "content": "Hello everyone in DotSama community, happy new year! \n\nThis is DrCAO, I am Ex. community manager at Parallel Finance and Para Space, and also director of Chinese community in WagMedia under Bounty 12. I'm a long-term supporter of DotSama, and I'm also active in supporting many other parachains in Dotsama project. This is my first proposal in Web3 in my whole life, and I am full of excitement and nervousness.\n\nMy first proposal to build AIWeb3 Chinese community unit. The mission of the AiWeb3 Chinese community is to continue building the community to support the Chinese content creators to focus on content creation in Dotsama, build connections for different parachain projects, and provide the latest information in Dotsama. The Chinese content creators can focus on researching and generating high-quality content, including dubbing, translating and also original content in Dotsama. In addition, we will put more resources into supporting the early-stage content creators so that they can build up the audience and brand.\n\nI have modified the original proposal based on the feedback from the community, and you can see the community discussion of the proposal here: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095). \n\n**The discussion posted on Jan. 2 received very positive feedback with 13 likes and 0 unlikes, we really appreciate your support on this proposal!  I would love to get feedback from the community so that I can come up with the best proposal, and I'd be happy to answer any questions and tweak the proposal as needed!**\n\nDotSama社区的各位，祝大家新年好！\n\n我是DrCao—— 我之前在 Parallel Finance 和 Para Space 担任社区经理，同时也是WagMedia里Bounty 12的中文社区负责人，我是DotSama的长期支持者，并且也很活跃的支持 Dotsama 中的许多其他平行链项目。这是我第一次在Web3中发起提案，有一些激动和紧张。\n\n这是我的第一个提案，建立一个“爱Web3中文社区”，爱Web3中文社区的使命是继续建设Dotsama社区，支持中文内容创作者专注于 Dotsama 的内容创作，为不同的平行链项目建立联系，并提供 Dotsama 的最新信息。中国内容创作者可以专注于研究和生产高质量的内容，包括在 Dotsama 中的配音、翻译和原创内容。此外，我们将投入更多资源支持早期的内容创作者，让他们建立受众和品牌。\n\n根据社区的反馈，我已经改进了原先的提案，你们可以到这查看社区的讨论和反馈: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095)\n\n这个提案的讨论在1月2号发布，收到了很正面的回馈，有13个likes，0个unlike，非常感谢大家对这个提案的支持！",

      "content": "**Proponent**: Subsquid Lab Official - FAyqRVLZmXVUU9pNeG8w8SxS5xRgN8FRGeWLL6u9S32TMHc\n\n**Short description**: Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable data indexing infrastructure for most of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem (and growing).\n\n**Raw data**: [Archive Infrastructure metrics - July, August, September](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBQPYlsB-2JLecP-0OXxfFEzlbPZsGGaFR5aCFLB1-KA7g6TqUnmHNM34dHl_yj9Xf9VWhw_gfUN58/pubhtml)\n\n**Requested KSM**: 1,447.28 KSM*\n*added 33.33 KSM due to bond associated with our proposal in governance 1.0. This proposal supersedes the proposal made with governance 1.0 = https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/246 . Further we added another 6.66 KSM due to an issue with u128 conversion for the requested amount in Polkadot JS. \n\n**Previous proposal**:\n\nhttps://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/171\n\nhttps://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/134\n\n# Motivation\nArchives are an important piece of Polkadot and Kusama data infrastructure provided by Subsquid. They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains getting support as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\n# Achievements\nAt the end of Q2 Subsquid released a new generation of Archives, together with a major version of the SDK, both code named “Fire Squid”.\nThe improvements brought by this release include:\n- Substantial performance increase, with the ability to deploy a new Archive for a chain as big as Kusama, and the indexing to be ready in roughly a day\n- Fire Squid Archives support batch requests, which lead to a hundredfold increase in performance of indexing project connecting to them (squids)\n- Fire Squid Archives expose two separate gateways, configured and tuned for different uses (one for data exploration by humans, the other one specifically for programmatic and batch access)\n- Fire Squid Archives “unwrap” proxy, sudo and batch calls, tracing the origin, but making them much easier to access them\nSubsquid has also engaged in continuously improving the product, iteratively working on adding features, such as EVM Transactions indexing, and subscriptions to queries in the Graphql endpoints of indexing projects created with the Subsquid SDK (commonly called squids).\n# Statistics\nBetween 2022-09-03 (when tracking has started) and 2022-09-30 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n- Served a total of 129,468,038.2 (~129 million) queries in the month of September alone\n- Our 7 day average peaks above 5 million queries and adjusts around 3.3 million queries per day at the end of the period\nData from the month of October confirms the linear trend, allowing us to make assumptions for the months of July and August, given the steady growth of queries over time shown.\n\nFull report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQji6zUckBRq3Q8H0xOSLjmFDUkKHckt9SiSIIMdCw_Ck_qpiAhFltGxnNavCmFJcebiBznKO_dleis/pub)",

      "title": "Polkadot Insider - Production of Dotsama ecosystem contents [NEW PROPOSAL]",
      "content": "Polkadot Insider is a media site that emphasizes on researching, creating insightful, educational contents of the Dotsama ecosystem, bringing HOTTEST news in the FASTEST ways, and the most important is to support projects built on Dotsama ecosystem to engage the community easier by creating marketing campaigns on Polkadot Insider.\n\nStarted from June, 2022, Polkadot Insider was created, and gained attention from Polkadot community on Twitter through our professionalized-simple content format, because we know the fact that, Twitter is the platform that people love to surf reading about cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, and a friendly content interface would easily catching their attention. The results is absolutely worth - until now December 2022, Polkadot Insider’s traffic is more than 1 million impressions per month. You can check out the [performance report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IDgIenmOBgLvcpDq_hhKp5jePqNrT6o7?usp=share_link) of the Polkadot Insider’s page.\n\nThe following proposal seeks funding for the production and development of Polkadot Insider in the next 4 months (from February 2023 to May 2023). This proposal is generated to officialize our contribution to the Dotsama ecosystem due to the last 6 months we seek a small amount of funding from separate projects to contribute directly to them.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to create a valuable media site for Dotsama that brings insightful content, fast news, and support promoting projects from different segments. Also, we intend to expand our work to the Youtube platform where we create an instructional library for users who love Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem!!\nMoreover, you can check again the [last discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2083) to have a better comparison. (I didn't clear the process so that I make new discussion)\nTo compare with the previous discussion, checking feedback from Raul, Kryptochain, Anaelle, and Polkadotter, there are some points I have updated:\n- Detailed 6 months' performance of our Twitter community in a very details report.\n- Detailed marketing strategy in the \"Outreach part\" of the full proposal.\n- In the last discussion, I called 148K for 6 months for maintaining our Twitter page, 60 How-to videos, 12 interview videos. In this new proposal, I adjusted down the cost to $61390 for 4 months for our Twitter page, 30 How-to videos, and 8 interview videos and manage a Crew3 community to get more potential users and enthusiasts on board (it would down 37,8% if we count on one month).\n- Audience target update: I updated our main target audience would be firstly in South Asia (when in my proposal mentioned about it more details).\n- Detailed Video plan that I would complete time by time.\n- Detailed budget distribution for each part.\n- Our official collaboration form for projects that have a campaign can contact us (we intend to diversify marketing campaigns for all projects have related to Dotsama with the same amount of content in terms of \"special campaigns\". \n- We'd expand time to deep-dive more amazing utilities to create content with this proposal as we mentioned in the documents, and Polkadot Insider daily would go higher than we did in the last period of time when we didn't have enough budget to invest enough time for it, still we got good results.\n- Lastly, we will start in February because we put it on chain in January.\n\n\nSome important documents: \n1. [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxVkqFmYMCbojl9ZLR9TC61DV4O9SDZhXlfIhz0PMu8/edit?usp=sharing)\n2. Full Treasury Proposal Spending [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g2SRskVS-SirMFAj9wvZ2p75aa2TaGv7?usp=share_link) of Polkadot Insider\n3. [Public Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jW2nFwOFAi2QbTlaJnSP5WNzSb0a1kGm?usp=share_link) for the community to check our work (we'll update the report weekly for anyone who is interested in checking it, but the full report will release after the period of the funding request.\n4. Video Youtube [plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18lAiD1oTsJ1StuAE9ko9JdeHeN_QrzNkvi2L6h6ehgY/edit?usp=share_link)\n\nFinally, thanks for all the support and recommendation from all the wonderful people who commended the last discussion, especially those who support me to adjust this proposal in detail.\n\nWe will launch our full report from metric performance,  the community feedback and further strategy for the next phrase in the beginning of June. \n\nYou can check the discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2102)!",

      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nBounty 12 has evolved over the past few years into an impressive content generation machine that supports early-stage creators on their journey to becoming confident and independent stewards of the story of Polkadot and Kusama by incentivizing them with KSM rewards and sub-bounties. Now we're taking the next step forward. In an effort to decentralize even more, Directors of specific units will now completely and independently head their units while utilizing WagMedia's tools to further the growth of the creators incubating under their tutelage.\n\nThis proposal aims to continue the funding of the Paraverse Content Creators (previously General Unit in WagMedia) which supports creators who report on and create original content to help promote Polkadot and Kusama, especially content focused on parachains, the relay chains that secure them, governance, and general principles collectively held by the community. For greater than a year, creators within this group have generated content on the relay chains and nearly every parachain in the ecosystem. This content has been produced in many different formats including interviews with founders, long-form articles, Twitter threads, YouTube and TikTok videos, and more.\n\nThe tools and methods we use to evaluate and reward content have improved as well and you can [learn all about the proposal here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hhu6K0sMqlsND2rxCNmHj55zdc6ATRKm3KxOJbSmpPs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can see the community discussion of the proposal over the past week [with response to comments here.](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2089)\n\nWe appreciate your support and look forward to spreading the story of Polkadot and Kusama even further!

      "title": "Kusama Governance Dashboard",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nWe finally have a [governance dashboard](https://www.kusamagovernance.com/) (currently only includes gov1 data)!\n\nWhile the [Proof of Chaos](https://www.proofofchaos.app/) project aims to incentivise governance participation, until now there was no way to actually measure the impact of these efforts. We decided to build this dashboard since no alternatives were available and received treasury funding for the undertaking.\n\n*To align interests with a successful outcome and ensure delivery we only asked for approximately **half** (10500 Euros) of the funding up-front ([the original proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gj4HMhI4syYFu5tGwR86m_Vqs7HzxneEH4qGETaSaEA/edit?usp=sharing)). These funds have already been **received** by us through [Proposal 145](https://www.dotreasury.com/ksm/proposals/145). After receiving positive feedback on the related [discussion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2091), we are now creating this proposal for the **remaining funding** (9200 Euros).*\n\n*9200 Euros = 9824 USD*\n\n*Using the EMA7: 24.65 USD/KSM*\n\n*9824 / 24.65 = 398.5 KSM*\n\n#### The dashboard is split into 3 parts\n\n**Main dashboard**\n\nPresents the most important statistics to show insightful trends.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/vB1cvPT\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3s1TYNj/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-22-44.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-22-44\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n**Single referendum view**\n\nDisplays all relevant information for a specific referendum.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/ZgCqT88\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/qgwT1ss/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-51-54.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-51-54\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n**Single account view**\n\nProvides insights into the voting behaviour of a specific wallet.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Wy8Gk1h\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VSnJg81/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-54-36.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-54-36\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n------------------\n<br />\n\nWe initially projected delivery to be in July 2022 and sincerely apologise for the **delay**. While work commenced immediately, we were not fully satisfied with previous iterations. Note that this project was largely executed by data analyst Claudia Yuan as to allow the existing devs for the Proof of Chaos project to keep focused on our other efforts.\n\n### Explanation of the design choices:\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\nFor the dashboard we built a custom [SubSquid indexer](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/indexer) that indexes all relevant governance data in real-time. You can query the data [here](https://squid.subsquid.io/referenda-dashboard/v/0/graphql).\n\n**Drawbacks**:\n\n1. Subsquid indexers are currently still running on **centralized** servers.\n2. The indexer needs to be updated each time there is a **runtime upgrade** with **breaking changes** to the existing logic. \n\n##### *Centralisation*\n\nCurrently all Subsquid indexers are running on the company's servers. While Subquery may have a more decentralized product, we still went with Subsquid due to the ease and speed of development with their solution. The support received from the Subsquid team as well as their commitment to the Polkadot Ecosystem also played a significant role in our decision. Note that Subsquid is working towards decentralisation.\n\n##### *Breaking changes through Runtime upgrades*\n\nThis should be less of an issue as the Kusama network becomes more stable and runtime upgrades become \"less invasive\".\n\n\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\nFor the [frontend](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/dashboard) we went with a Python Framework called Dash. While this helped us to build quicker, it limited us in flexibility. This route was chosen due to Claudia's familiarity with Python.\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\n### Continuation of the project...\n\nWe are of course interested in extending the dashboard to also include **OpenGov** (Gov2) data. This would be required to measure the effect of our incentivisation efforts going forward. It would involve updating the indexer to incorporate all OpenGov events + extrinsics as well as adapting the front-end to the new type of data (charts/filtering by tracks etc.).\n\nFeel free to also throw any **feature requests** you may have in the comments of the [discussion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2091). Thank you very much.",

      "content": "I was informed by Kami from PolkaGate team that they have successfully [submitted the first fast-unstake process in Kusama](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x58baab6ce8d74e1be1743b57d68fad11dcc1eed9ef26b892003291e33dccea18). While this is great, I proposed to them to also test submitting multiple fast-unstake requests in parallel, so that we can test the [batching functionality](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/12394). Given the minimum nomination bond of 0.1 KSM, this requires a bit of initial funds, which I am suggesting to allocate to this team from the treasury. \n\nWhile most of these funds can be returned after the fact, I advocating for considering it a gift to the PolkaGate team, as they have consistently been the first wallet to implement latest staking features, and provider invaluable feedback to myself and the rest of the staking team.

      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nI am proposing this tip with multiple goals, in brief they are:\n\n1. To provide a reward to Adam (8 KSM)\n2. To test the use of batch statements to issue rewards\n3. Fund [an account](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Gch4VxQ79WhjgQqHomvJbqF3Woza5g5cYgM8SVQdDb9szz1?tab=extrinsic) used for public validator payouts as a `finder's fee` (2 KSM)\n\nThe main recipient of funding from this tip is Adam Steebar for compiling and maintaining [details related to Open Governance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHgjfaV0bvYVlsQswEM0EltuYnpYl7GJdg24H-sFpiM/edit#gid=663805148) with recent runtime releases.  He has also engaged in discussion on github relating to same [here ](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6398)and [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6409).  Despite the outcome I appreciate that he applied his Economics skill set to aid the community.\n\nAdditionally, I am taking an opportunity to test batch calls for issuing tips.  In the previous governance model the system required a single primary recipient of tip funding, this test allows for a split of tips among different parties.  If this executes successfully it establishes a model for future payments requiring such action.\n\nFinally, I am directing 20% of this 'Tip' to an account used by a public staking reward payout bot.  This fee is the equivalent of the now debunked finder's fee of the old governance while awarding the recipient the maximum of what would have been a small tip.  \n\nI look forward to a successful test.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n\n",

Compared to running a validator, for which there is plenty of documentation, RPC nodes require more configuruation. In particular, the guide explains how to set up the SSL proxy and how to stress test the node.\n\nStakeworld also corrected and improved the official documentation on the [polkadot wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-wss) to that end.",

      "content": "Hello, I'm Claudio and you probably recognise me from the KryptosChain Youtube channel. \nSome of you already know that I've also started a Youtube channel to also help educate the Romanian community on the Polkadot ecosystem.\nThe channel can be found here with the name [Polkadot Romania](https://www.youtube.com/@polkadotromania)\n\nI started this channel at the end of June 2022 and you can find all the details in the proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/121qMKEzJyioIyWvtDw7aYGuZsW9mfNBXc3Crd6Wf2b0)\n\nThe idea is to continue funding it for continuation so that the education can continue for Romanians in their native language.\n\nThe asking amount is **1,359.67 KSM** for **83** educational videos & at least **2 Twitter Spaces** per month to help drive more engagement through from other Romanian Crypto communities, which is worth approximately **$33,380** at the current market rate.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or doubts, please feel free to ask in the comment section below. \n\nHappy New Year 2023 everyone & let's help the Polkadot ecosystem grow, together !\n\nRegards,\n\nClaudio\n\n********************************\n**Update !**\n\nThis referendum is currently winning and there are 8 days and 13 hours left from the time of writing this before a decision is made. Should this pass, the proposal from this [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2093) will no longer happen until a later time when funding for both channels will be requested and re-calculated based on the KSM price at the time and the dates would be modified. \n\nHowever, that being said, should 46 pass, I will continue to also deliver Polkadot content to my English channel so as to maintain the community up to date, but the quality will not be the same as if funding would be allocated to it due to the inability to pay a video editor and having to do the work myself.\nShould referendum 46 not pass, I will then go ahead and launch the proposal from the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2093) as a referendum on chain. I hope this is understandable. Thanks as always for your time !",

      "content": "**Proponent**: Subsquid Lab Official - FAyqRVLZmXVUU9pNeG8w8SxS5xRgN8FRGeWLL6u9S32TMHc\n\n**Short description**: Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable data indexing infrastructure for most of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem (and growing).\n\n**Raw data**: [Archive Infrastructure metrics - July, August, September](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBQPYlsB-2JLecP-0OXxfFEzlbPZsGGaFR5aCFLB1-KA7g6TqUnmHNM34dHl_yj9Xf9VWhw_gfUN58/pubhtml)\n\n**Requested KSM**: 1,340.48 KSM\n\n**Previous proposal**:\n\nhttps://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/171\n\nhttps://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/134\n\n# Motivation\nArchives are an important piece of Polkadot and Kusama data infrastructure provided by Subsquid. They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains getting support as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\n# Achievements\nAt the end of Q2 Subsquid released a new generation of Archives, together with a major version of the SDK, both code named “Fire Squid”.\nThe improvements brought by this release include:\n- Substantial performance increase, with the ability to deploy a new Archive for a chain as big as Kusama, and the indexing to be ready in roughly a day\n- Fire Squid Archives support batch requests, which lead to a hundredfold increase in performance of indexing project connecting to them (squids)\n- Fire Squid Archives expose two separate gateways, configured and tuned for different uses (one for data exploration by humans, the other one specifically for programmatic and batch access)\n- Fire Squid Archives “unwrap” proxy, sudo and batch calls, tracing the origin, but making them much easier to access them\nSubsquid has also engaged in continuously improving the product, iteratively working on adding features, such as EVM Transactions indexing, and subscriptions to queries in the Graphql endpoints of indexing projects created with the Subsquid SDK (commonly called squids).\n# Statistics\nBetween 2022-09-03 (when tracking has started) and 2022-09-30 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n- Served a total of 129,468,038.2 (~129 million) queries in the month of September alone\n- Our 7 day average peaks above 5 million queries and adjusts around 3.3 million queries per day at the end of the period\nData from the month of October confirms the linear trend, allowing us to make assumptions for the months of July and August, given the steady growth of queries over time shown.\n\nFull report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQji6zUckBRq3Q8H0xOSLjmFDUkKHckt9SiSIIMdCw_Ck_qpiAhFltGxnNavCmFJcebiBznKO_dleis/pub)",

      "content": "## 1kv insights - website and analysis\n\nValidators are the core of NPOS networks like Polkadot and Kusama. In order to avoid concentrated risk with few validators, it is important that the set of validators is sufficiently diverse and decentralized. The Thousands Validators Programme (1kv programme) encourages decentralization of the validators by giving a platform to individuals that want to start running a validator. \n\n- This proposal will **build dashboards with the historical performance and statistics of the 1kv validators**. This unique and detailed insight is important for independent nominators and staking pool operators that are deciding to stake with a 1kv validator.\n\n- With all the data collected, the proposal intends **to answer fundamental questions about the 1kv programme**; for example, is the network more decentralized, does it fulfil its promise for long-term participants to become independent, ... Optimizing the 1kv programme will benefit the whole network.\n\n- Lastly, we intend to **document the inner workings of the 1kv scoring mechanism**. This will allow operators to better align themselves towards the priorities that 1kv wants to incentivize.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MathCryptoDoc/dotsama-snippets/main/1kv-insight-proposal/alpha-site.png)\n\nSince the last month, we have made available an [alpha version of the proposed 1kv insight page](https://insights.math-crypto.com/). It is functional but with only a few metrics. It has 20 to 30 unique visitors *daily*.\n\nFor more details including costs, see our full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mv0GbmkmtOz132C3C1byOK4PVjXxlB4MUak0YYQAaWs).\n\nThe proposal has been up for discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1953) since 10 Nov 2022. Community feedback was incorporated.\n\nRequested funding: USD 39'923 or KSM 1'533 based on EMA7 at the time of submission.",

      "content": "A while back I started preparing a proposal for writing 3 articles within the broader topic of privacy preserving legal transformation in Polkadot. You can find the previous proposal [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1505). I had sought feedback via the Kusama Direction channel back then and the topic of Power of Attorney (PoA) was a clear favorite. Therefore, I have now decided to pursue that topic specifically.\n\nTo reinforce that, I got feedback from the community members that as a first step to win the community's trust and prove added value, it might be better to focus on a smaller funding amount and as such limit the proposal to just one article. That's exactly my plan now.\n\nFinally, I've been told that by limiting the scope of research to the Swiss law only, the impact for the community might be reduced. As such, I've decided to expand the scope and focus on building a general legal framework to regulate on-chain PoA. The authorities (especially in Europe) will face the same types of challenges when dealing with digitising the legal system and I aim to provide a framework and guidelines for addressing these issues from first principles (both legal and technological). In order to ground my research in a practical environment and not just theoretical constructs, I will use the Swiss juridical system to provide examples where appropriate.\n\nYou can find the full proposal on [my GitHub](https://github.com/legal-julia/power-of-attorney-on-polkadot). Below is the summary of the topic and as always, feedback is very welcome:\n\n**On-chain Power of Attorney: challenges and promises for a legal system.**\n- How is PoA currently enforced in EU & Switzerland, who benefits from it and who can abuse it?\n- Private key ?= full access revisited: a need for additional, trusted verification (or else take all my money).\n- A partially government-controlled blockchain - pros and cons. Could a parachain be the solution?\n- Encrypted 'allow-revoke' mechanism, revealable only to selected parties, by the means of substrate chain and a user-friendly app.\n\nThe resulting research article will be submitted to an open-access journal.",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I am Hitesh from Describedot. We create educational videos and weekly updates around the Dotsama ecosystem. We started this channel about a year ago and we have already published 34 videos on our youtube channel. Our weekly viewing growth had been over 28 percent which led us to approximately 30,000 views in a year. Recently we’ve also received great support from the Council Members of Polkadot and Kusama through tip endorsements. We are really thankful to the community members who supported us and assisted us in making great content.\n\nJust last year we learned that people want to know about governance, about networks but they don’t have any resources to walk them through it. We decided to create basic videos during our early days and this has helped users to explore the Polkadot stack. They expressed their gratitude through likes and comments on our videos. Our main focus is to teach the Polkadot stack as well as governance in layman's terms to the Hindi audience.\n\nOur first milestone was covered by WagMedia but we are looking to continue the work with a spending proposal.\n\nYou can learn more about our proposal from the document. Let the community know if you have any questions. We are happy to answer them.\n\n\n[Describedot ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnweYrk-ooQqfbha_EJUy9qYx3KDN3mk6PZVM7k0UPM/edit)\n\nPS : We will make sure to return the remaining amount to the Kusama treasury.\n\n",

The parameter \"after\" was misinterpreted resulting in an enactment time of 2.8 years and will be cancelled with others in the same situation, it can be found  [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/5)] \n\n----------------\n\nHi Community,\n\nWe recently launched [Polkawatch decentralization analytics on Kusama](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1578348493303083008), and [Nomination Pools](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1583591038572036098) support.\n\nThe community is becoming more and more aware of the need for effective decentralization in our Ecosystem.\n\nThe interest peaked with a recent[ deplatforming event of Solana nodes](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1588130270917627910) by a Network operator. \n\nWe are been contacted by other teams of our community: Wallets, Parachains, Data Scientists, etc That want access to the data and help contribute to bringing awareness to the ecosystem. Which I think is good news.\n\nParachains are secured by the rely chain, but they are still vulnerable to censorship. Censorship could come from dishonest collators, deplatforming from network operators or sudden regulatory changes from hosting Countries. Despite been secured by the rely chain, parachains would benefit from decentralization analytics too.\n\nOn this proposal we aim to bring parachain support for Polkawatch, on top of continued operation of the service and other minor improvements.\n\nThe proposal has been for [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1942) here.\n\nWe were invited to participate in [AAG#11](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1595083537107009537) where an interesting discussion followed\n\nCommunity feedback has been incorporated to the proposal.\n\nYou can access the [detailed proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljvYDuazbNBgjf94yFUbUEdeyBN5ixG6BXAEKxuxmL4/edit?usp=sharing) here.",

      "content": "The InvArch Network team seeks to provide the ecosystem with a new multi-signature solution, named Saturn, **available to every parachain & implementable throughout any dApp on those parachains**. This multi-signature solution will be made so that it can be **easily adopted by existing wallets in the ecosystem** & be immediately implemented to provide a superior multi-signature solution to the Dotsama ecosystem **compared to external solutions such as Gnosis Safe**.\n\nMulti-party ownership solutions are the core of nearly every project being developed by the InvArch Network team, which has heavily influenced the design of the network’s infrastructure. While sharing our proposed multi-signature implementation with other builders & community members throughout the ecosystem, we have received tremendous interest & support. We also had a meeting with a member (Ricardo) from Parity Technologies in the past regarding our solution and received positive feedback on its capabilities.\n\nThe current multi-signature implementations available for builders in the ecosystem either rely on the current implementation used in the original multi-sig Pallet developed by Parity (which is limiting) or by developing their own custom solutions (which is time-consuming & costly). The ecosystem also lacks account-recovery capabilities & the ability to onboard & off-board new members of a multi-signature implementation. This is a very restricting problem, with concerns being shared across the Kusama community. We would like to change this current reality.\n\nWhat we are proposing to build for the ecosystem is designed to service the entirety of Kusama & its parachains. We are providing it in a way that individuals will never need to purchase TNKR (optional, though) & can use KSM. **This is an open-source solution for Kusama and a solution that we truly believe will be a big boost for the ecosystem.** We are confident that if trusted by the community to deliver this solution, Kusama will go from having one of the worst multi-sig experiences in Web3 to one of the best, if not the best. Public interest in the potential for our multi-sig has been shared by the community in the past, and we would be extremely grateful if the community will signal their support for us to build this for Kusama.\n\n- A full overview of the proposal & cost breakdown can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQLhnD3l0K5fYQN9_ECiHUeQZT_lTN4FvWkkPKIWy8mVGvhvKwmjwrMIlwHCVlitA0ovWyF2Qvaplfu/pub)\n\n- A link to the public discussion previously posted regarding this proposal can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2031).",

      "content": "As we navigate OpenGov, we re finding new things again, a second time: referendum #1 would not have enacted succesfully, because the call we used (treasury.ApproveProposal) would have only be enacted successfully with root origin. Additionally, we have now discovered that referendum #3 will also not be enacted successfully due to a polkadot-js UI issue whereby it used the expected enactment block as the enactment duration rather than particular given time, so the proposal would take many years to enact.\n\nThis has since been fixed in the polkadot-js UI.\n\nThis is the (hopefully final) resubmission of the proposal:\n\n- on Treasurer track (same one)\n- with the call treasury.Spend (including the amount in KSM for the allocation)\n\nOriginal replaced treasury submission: [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/229)\nSecond replaced treasury referenda: [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/3)\n\nThis proposal is now up for vote! aiming to cover the development of **Snowbridge** by the Snowfork team: a fully trustless, permissionless and general purpose bridge between Kusama/Polkadot and Ethereum. The bridge will launch on the Bridge Hub, a common-good parachain that is being developed by Parity for Kusama and Polkadot. This proposal is a funding request for 28 months worth of long term runway for all operations for the Snowbridge team (16 months retroactive, 12 months in future), with the goal to launch as a common-good bridge on the Bridge hub on both Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nThe full proposal can be reviewed on [the post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/229) and includes extensive additional details related to further motivation for supporting and promoting Snowbridge, a long term roadmap, governance and economic plans as well as long term economic incentives for successful execution, launch and running of the project. Please note that both networks are voting on the project: the Polkadot proposal (up for vote by the council as external motion and later by the community if approved) can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/229).",

      "content": "Replacement of [Referendum #11](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/11)\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC. It is an alternative to subxt, which provides a similar functionality. RPC clients are needed in any software component, connecting to a substrate parachain. Therefore it is advisable, that there is more than one client available for Rust developers. Apart from that, the substrate-api-client fills a gap, providing the possibility to create extrinsics in a no_std-environment. Thereby facilitating extrinsic creation from within trusted hardware (like Intel sgx). This has a big potential for further usage in IoT environments. Last but not least, the substrate-api-client has an easy-to-use interface and comes with many practical examples, which makes it a good option for new developers.\n\nThis proposal aims to fund:\n\n1. maintenance and support for the substrate api client over 3 months (Nov-22 until Jan-23).\n\n2. evaluation and design of two new features:\n     - CLI-wallet implementation\n     - full no_std-compatibility\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1923) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJzzmimz_pjK-_4TunKvs-i2Zot2_9Ob3qUr7BlzaNo/edit?usp=sharing) for the details.\n",

      "title": "[Resubmission proposal 4] Treasury Proposal: Ordum | Public Good Grants Aggregator for Polkadot and Kusama",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nWe are resubmitting our proposal due to issues with the UX indicating enacment 3 years from now. The previous proposal can be viewed [here](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/4).\n\nOrdum is a public good grants aggregator for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. This proposal addresses the funding of R&D.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThere is no existing software besides Gitcoin to publish, apply for and manage grants. Gitcoin focuses on a quadratic funding model, while there is a need for an overall indexer and management software for grants in web3.\n\nAfter reading the Builders Program [post](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/builders-programs/226) on the Polkadot Forum and speaking with other members of the community (including councillors, Web3 Foundation, and members of Shokunin Network), it was evident that a grants aggregator is imperative for bringing projects into the ecosystem as well as scaling it.\n\nIn order to construct a rich and independent environment of public goods and DAOs, it is fundamental for teams to easily find and acquaint themselves with treasuries and foundations.\n\n**Problem**\n\n- Treasuries / foundations(eg. Polkadot Treasury) are burning funds as there are not enough projects to support.\n\n- Grants information and guidelines within the ecosystems are scattered and therefore difficult to find (there are only 2 places where we have a somewhat overview of these; Polkadot/Kusama documentation and Web3 Foundation Github).\n\n- It is difficult to publicly track (grant) funding for different stages of project development. This has previously resulted in conflicts within the community.\n\n- There isn’t a unified public record to privately / publicly manage and display a grant recipient’s quality and outcome of delivery (scattered documentation).\n\n- With GOV2 incoming, further research is required on tracking proposals and deliverables in order to determine the appropriate UX.\n\n**Solution**\n\nSuccess for Ordum is the deliverance of all milestones and a V1 POC of a public goods grant aggregator.\n**\nA dapp which contains all grants from the ecosystems.**\n\n- Index data from treasuries in the ecosystem by building custom APIs(Subsquids) for tracking proposals\n- Integrate Github in the front end for tracking and submitting non-treasury grants\n- Building and maintaining light clients for quick data retrivals, security and low loading times\n- Enable log in with multiple DID services, Github and Wallets\n\n**Minting of non-transferable NFTs as “certificates” for completed milestones. Each token would contain information on what was executed and how it was evaluated.**\n\n- Ordum will be built on Phala to leverege the chains privacy capabilities and Phat smart contracts\n- Create a connection between DID (foundation)–> Phala Smart Contract–> Non-transferable NFT–>DID (recipient)\n- Design a custom type of RMRK non-transferable NFT, stored on Crust, containing reports from the foundations on milestone delivery\n**\nDelivery of milestones, grant applications and funding are displayed on a team’s profile for transparency.**\n\n- Front end displaying funding amounts and certificates within a roadmap\n\n**Issuing surveys and analyzing / feedback data for the purpose of aggregating and managing treasury grants in the most optimal way.**\n\n- Design the optimal UX through collaboration with other teams in the ecosystem\n\nRequested funding 78,804 USD // 2770 KSM\nKusama rate EMA7 as per 12th of December 2022, 11.00 (and reimburstment of submission and decision deposit)\n\nThe full proposal can be viewed [here](https://hackmd.io/@XyloDrone/Ordum)\n\nWe look forward to hearing your feedback.\n",

One for selecting the best validators and another for gathering staking income in a spreadsheet. You can try the validator selector [here](https://james-sangalli.github.io/dot-validator-selector/) and the staking income spreadsheet generator [here](https://james-sangalli.github.io/dot-staking-income-web/).\n\nI originally set out to create these tools because I was struggling with staking. Selecting the best validators and tracking your staking income were unsolved issues at the time and they are still causing confusion for many. Therefore, I decided to solve my own problems and the problems of others by creating simple, easy to use tools that would get the job done. \n\nYou can read the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YT2qssdH12AtWFRloRnBanK6H1sGuE6EaX782d4qK40/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider this proposal!",

      "content": "Hi Community,\n\nWe recently launched [Polkawatch decentralization analytics on Kusama](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1578348493303083008), and [Nomination Pools](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1583591038572036098) support.\n\nThe community is becoming more and more aware of the need for effective decentralization in our Ecosystem.\n\nThe interest peaked with a recent[ deplatforming event of Solana nodes](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1588130270917627910) by a Network operator. \n\nWe are been contacted by other teams of our community: Wallets, Parachains, Data Scientists, etc That want access to the data and help contribute to bringing awareness to the ecosystem. Which I think is good news.\n\nParachains are secured by the rely chain, but they are still vulnerable to censorship. Censorship could come from dishonest collators, deplatforming from network operators or sudden regulatory changes from hosting Countries. Despite been secured by the rely chain, parachains would benefit from decentralization analytics too.\n\nOn this proposal we aim to bring parachain support for Polkawatch, on top of continued operation of the service and other minor improvements.\n\nThe proposal has been for [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1942) here.\n\nWe were invited to participate in [AAG#11](https://twitter.com/polkawatch/status/1595083537107009537) where an interesting discussion followed\n\nCommunity feedback has been incorporated to the proposal.\n\nYou can access the [detailed proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljvYDuazbNBgjf94yFUbUEdeyBN5ixG6BXAEKxuxmL4/edit?usp=sharing) here.\n",

      "content": "- **Treasury Proposal:** Snowbridge Funding Proposal\n- **Beneficiary:** Gbb7iGbd6Q7o1fGcT2Re4L6RXJ3U7A32itSLMjsUJzmq5LD\n- **Amount:** USD 612,000.00 based on EMA7 rate by Subscan\n- **Scope:** See the [full funding proposal](https://spinamp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmehcCU8LjXRpj962YZYVJfHzwecvvdxbRH9BMEmiumcb9) for more details\n\n# Overview\nSnowbridge is a fully trustless, permissionless and general purpose bridge between Polkadot networks and Ethereum. The proposal covers a request for a 28 months worth of runway for all operations for the Snowbridge team, with the goal to launch as a common-good bridge on Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nOur bridge will launch on the Bridge Hub, a common-good parachain that is being developed by Parity for Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nThe proposal includes a motivation for supporting and promoting Snowbridge, a long term roadmap, governance and economic plans as well as incentives for successful execution, launch and long term running of the project.\n\n# Changes\nThe original Polkassembly post was created 4 weeks ago with extensive community discussion around the project here: [https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1341](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1341)\n\nThis final proposal is the same as in the above post, though a few small changes have been made:\n\n- Added more details about the bridge hub, with XCMv3 and Statemint XCM as an extra milestone of work on our roadmap\n- Add 1 month to the launch date to account for the extra work needed for XCMv3 changes for to bridge hub\n- We've extended the runway to 28 months instead of 24 month, but we're keeping the price the same and will cover the additional months with a small reduction in costs\n\n# History\nSnowfork is one of the longest running teams contributing to the Polkadot ecosystem. For over 2 years we've been working on Snowbridge, a fully trustless and permissionless bridge to Ethereum. We successfully built and completed an initial version of this bridge in September 2021, based on an Ethereum Proof of Work light client and on Parity's original BEEFY proof system funded by an initial grant from the Web3 Foundation.\n\n# Purpose\nPolkadot already has a few live Ethereum bridges across various parachains, but these all compromise on Polkadot's security and trust model. Some are secured by trusted multi-sigs, some are secured by alternative insurance collateral, but none are secured by Polkadot and none of the Ethereum or ERC20 assets that exist in the Polkadot ecosystem today are secured by Polkadot's security and trust model.\n\nWe believe that without a fully trustless bridge that is secured by Polkadot itself, the security of the wider Polkadot ecosystem is put at risk and that Snowbridge's trustless design is essential to a healthy ecosystem that can support Ethereum-based assets. Similarly, trustless support for Polkadot assets across the Ethereum ecosystem will be a valuable boon for us all.\n\nSnowbridge is also general-purpose, supporting arbitrary message passing and cross-chain smart contract calls, so any kinds of applications can be developed on top of it beyond plain asset transfer.\n\nAdditionally, as a common good service, longer term Snowbridge will be able to provide new value for the DOT token itself and generate an additional source of income for the treasury, or an additional lockup/burn mechanism for reducing the DOT supply.\n\n## Funding Request\nThis proposal is a funding request for 28 months worth of long term runway for all operations for the Snowbridge team *(16 months retroactive, 12 months in future)*, with the goal to launch as a common-good bridge on the Bridge hub on both Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nThe full proposal has been uploaded to IPFS separately, and includes extensive additional details related to further motivation for supporting and promoting Snowbridge, a long term roadmap, governance and economic plans as well as long term economic incentives for successful execution, launch and running of the project.\n\nWe request that anyone looking to meaningfully contribute to this discussion also reads through this full proposal.\n\nThis initial funding requests will be created alongside a secondary request on Kusama:\n\n- **Requested USD on Polkadot:** USD 2,448,000.00 based on EMA7 rate by Subscan.\n- **Requested USD on Kusama:** USD 612,000.00 based on EMA7 rate by Subscan.\n\nThere is an additional request for around USD 10,000,000.00 of long term economic incentives tied to key success milestones on the bridge, tied to measurable impact on the Polkadot ecosystem, although this payment will not be part of this first requested allocation.\n\nWe're planning to push out this proposal in the next month, and so are looking for early feedback and discussion from the community before going live with the proposal.\n\n## Roadmap\n1. Support XCMv3\n2. Mint wrapped assets on Statemint\n3. Governance and upgradability\n4. Dynamic circuit breaker on withdrawals \n5. Security Audits\n6. Deploy on Kusama (April 2023)\n7. Deploy on Polkadot (July 2023)\n\nSee the [full funding proposal](https://spinamp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmehcCU8LjXRpj962YZYVJfHzwecvvdxbRH9BMEmiumcb9) for more details.",

      "content": "![](https://luckyfriday.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/lucky-friday-logo-full.png)\n\nThe Lucky Friday team seeks funding to provide RPC services for the Kusama and Statemine networks. We are well established within the ecosystem, operating numerous geo-diverse validators, collators, miners, and vaults on Kusama and Polkadot.\n\nOur team intends to provide RPC services at our SOC 2 Type 2, CCSS-compliant facilities, co-located on dedicated bare-metal servers. We are investing significant capital upfront, believing we can offer reliable and secure unmetered service to the community at a fixed and reasonable cost.\n\nOur decades of data center experience – and desire to encourage ecosystem growth – means that we recognize and are concerned about the risk of centralization happening due to the haste of quickly turning up nodes in AWS, Google Cloud, and others. Hetzner has already begun shutting down crypto-related activities.\n\nWe desire to leverage our high-performance, high-availability infrastructure, and scalability to support the Dotsama ecosystem by providing the enterprise-level connectivity needed to serve an ever-growing userbase and support influential applications like Polkadot.js, Talisman, PolkaGate, Nova, and more.\n\nThe full proposal ([available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sNh6kpdXcW0ZJ1ta9rjFtYQ0DZVg7TOBUepJco5LbWk/edit \"Lucky Friday RPC Proposal – Council Submission\")) was posted for discussion ([post 1934](../post/1934 \"Lucky Friday | Cost-Effective Proposal for High-Performance Bare-Metal RPC Nodes\")) on November 4, 2022, and has received very positive feedback, with 21 likes and 0 dislikes.\n\nAs outlined, we seek initial funding of $11,200 (402.95 KSM based on EMA7). Upon successful completion of milestones as set out in the proposal, we will report on our undertaking and provide details on load tests. We would then further engage for monthly recurring costs of $14,920 (requested quarterly).\n\nDue to the extreme nature of recent market volatility, we understand that the requested KSM may fall short or exceed the dollar amount needed. If we fall short, we would like to include this amount in our following proposal to continue RPC service. If we are in excess, we will return the balance of funds to the treasury.",

      "content": "**KAGOME proposal:** [link to the full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_MZYihw7bqRVdW6efi3vRinAk39N_QnAQeU0jRaXQ4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![image alt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soramitsu/kagome/master/docs/image_assets/kagome-logo-(new-2020).svg)\n\nKAGOME is one of the most advanced alternative Polkadot client implementations in the Polkadot ecosystem:\n* Written using modern C++\n* All code is available on [github repo](https://github.com/soramitsu/kagome) under Apache 2.0 license\n* A fully synced Polkadot node can be found in telemetry (navigate to [Polkadot Telemetry](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/) and type KAGOME)\n* Polkadot.JS compatibility (Feel free to open [Polkadot JS interface](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fws.polkadot-node-1.s0.tst.kagome.soramitsu.co.jp#/explorer) to interact with our node)\n* Possibility to run as a validator (without parachain support)\n* Implements the [Polkadot Host Specification](https://spec.polkadot.network/)\n* [Web3 Foundation grant recipient](https://medium.com/web3-builders/web3-builders-soramitsu-ebd7163febb7)\n\nOur team intends to further support KAGOME by completing its integration in the Polkadot ecosystem and allow node operators to run KAGOME as validating nodes. Moreover, Web3 Foundation and its protocol specification team is willing to support the KAGOME project by helping enhance protocol specification taking into account feedback that will be provided by the KAGOME team on a regular basis.\n\nThis proposal describes new features to be implemented as part of a KUSAMA treasury grant.\n\n\n## Proposed feature set: \n### Parachains integration\n\nParachains are an essential part of the Polkadot ecosystem. Supporting parachains is what makes Polkadot different from other standalone Substrate-based networks. In order to support parachains, the following parts should be implemented; (following the Parachain Implementation Guide: )\n\n* Collation protocol\n* Backing protocol\n* Availability and validity protocol\n* Dispute resolution\n\n### Warp sync\n\n\nCurrently, in order to spin up a node with full chain synchronization, it is necessary to apply every block and reproduce its state or use a fast sync protocol that essentially downloads all the headers from the blockchain and block justifications containing authority changes and its most recent state.\nHowever, there is a third approach: using Warp sync. Warp sync only downloads the headers and justifications of blocks where an authority change is happening, which would allow node runners to trustlessly spin up the node within 10-20 minutes. Also, this is a great foundation for future light client implementations based on KAGOME.\n\n### Light client protocol (incoming requests)\n\nIn order to send merkle proofs to light clients, KAGOME needs to support the /dot/light/2 substream protocol. As the Polkadot ecosystem has light clients like Smoldot that are capable of running in the browser, support for WebSockets into cpp-libp2p (that is the networking layer of KAGOME) is needed. \n\n### Dynamic pruning\n\nCurrently KAGOME can only be executed in archive mode; where every state is stored in a Merkle state trie. While this is good for querying the balance of an account at any particular block it consumes a lot of disk space (about 500GB for 11 million blocks in Polkadot).\n\nTo make running in archive mode optional, it is necessary to introduce dynamic pruning that would only keep the states of recent N blocks, where N could be set using `--pruning <arg>` flag.\n\n### Lean BEEFY proofs integration\n\nIn order to run our validator in the Rococo network, it is necessary to support BEEFY proofs. As BEEFY is currently under development, the Rococo network uses Lean BEEFY.\n\nHaving lean BEEFY integrated would allow KAGOME to participate in BEEFY consensus, which is useful for external bridges.\n\n### Storage optimization\n\nKAGOME uses RocksDB as the database level for storing blockchain data such as block headers, bodies, justifications, and state. It is needed to logically divide these datasets into their own column families to give room for further optimizations.\n\n### Multithreading\n\nCurrently, KAGOME utilizes one thread for networking operations and block creation/execution. Additionally, there is a thread pool that creates a new thread for every web socket connection. To optimize it further, it is necessary to introduce separate threads for networking operations and block execution/creation procedures.\n\n### General maintenance\n\n**Runtime benchmarking**\n\nIn order to optimize KAGOME’s block creation speed, runtime benchmarks are needed to simplify different WASM engines (Binaryen, WAVM, WASMEdge) testing.\n\n**Catching up with Polkadot/Substrate development**\n\nIt is necessary to implement new RPCs and Host APIs whenever they are introduced and utilized in Polkadot/Substrate, so that KAGOME does not end up in a situation where new blocks cannot be executed due to a lack of functionality or compatibility with PolkadotJS apps.\n\n**Libp2p maintenance**\n\nKAGOME is the main user of the cpp-libp2p library maintained by Soramitsu. Library needs to be updated whenever any issues are recognized\n\n**DevOps support**\n\nIn order to ensure that the KAGOME node is operational whenever new changes are merged to the master code, we are providing continuous integration on the several AWS environments which require constant maintenance by DevOps team\n\n## Submission details\n\nAll details are available in the [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_MZYihw7bqRVdW6efi3vRinAk39N_QnAQeU0jRaXQ4/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**The amount requested for the first submission is $565000.**\n**The amount in KSM is 17953 taking into account KSM EMA (7) rate provided by Subscan service KSM prices (USD) for November, 10th**\n\nThe amount will be recalculated according to the 7 day average rate, using the high and low of the week on Coingecko, at the day of on-chain action after the discussion process ends.\n\n**The 1st milestone includes:**\n\n* Parachain support\n* Warp sync\n* Light client protocol (for incoming requests)\n* Dynamic pruning\n* Lean BEEFY integration\n* Storage optimization\n* Multithreading\n* General maintenance\n\n## Links and references\n\n1.

      "content": "Hello everyone, I am Hitesh from Describedot. We create educational videos and weekly updates around the Dotsama ecosystem. We started this channel about a year ago and we have already published 34 videos on our youtube channel. Our weekly viewing growth had been over 28 percent which led us to approximately 30,000 views in a year. Recently we’ve also received great support from the Council Members of Polkadot and Kusama through tip endorsements. We are really thankful to the community members who supported us and assisted us in making great content.\n\nJust last year we learned that people want to know about governance, about networks but they don’t have any resources to walk them through it. We decided to create basic videos during our early days and this has helped users to explore the Polkadot stack. They expressed their gratitude through likes and comments on our videos. Our main focus is to teach the Polkadot stack as well as governance in layman's terms to the Hindi audience.\n\nOur first milestone was covered by WagMedia but we are looking to continue the work with a spending proposal. \n\nYou can learn more about our proposal from the document. Let the community know if you have any questions. We are happy to answer them\n\n[Describedot](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vnweYrk-ooQqfbha_EJUy9qYx3KDN3mk6PZVM7k0UPM/edit)",

      "title": "Further funding for Proof of Chaos",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nThe Proof of Chaos (formerly Governance Participation Rewards) project incentivises voting to decentralise Kusama. We reward referenda voters with NFTs and build out tools to increase governance participation. [Our website](https://www.proofofchaos.app/)\n\nThank you for supporting the project thus far!\n![](https://i.ibb.co/qYKrW5K/download.jpg)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/Kj2xxt5/newplot-17.png)\n\nWe would like to give you an update on what we have been up to over the past 3.5 months and hope to be granted additional funds for continued development of tools that improve voter participation and make the project more fun, fair and engaging.\n\nTo achieve this goal we would like to onboard two great developers ([niftesty](https://twitter.com/niftesty) on frontend / next.js & Thomas on backend work) for fixed term contributions: 40h/month. They have built our current website and their focus will be to build it out further. I (Gabriel) will be scaling back a bit on the development side and focusing on operations a.k.a. the rewards themselves. My mission specifically will be to make the rewards more engaging and work on utility use cases.\n\nWith a focus on increasing the value of our collection(s) we aim to boost our revenues and get to a self-sustaining level faster. We are also working on more revenue streams to ensure more predictable and constant income.\n\nA large chunk of the funds is for past project management expenses that we have not been able to cover with our revenues. While I (Gabriel) always ensure that we have enough funds to pay everyone else involved with the project, I made the deliberate decision from the start to align my interests with that of the project: meaning I should only be rewarded if the project is successful.\n \nRather than asking for payment upfront, I do the work first and only ask the treasury to help out when our revenues fall short. Through this structure I of course take the risk of the community not deeming the project worthy of additional funds and thus I am incentivized to ensure that the project continues to perform well. At the same time the community only pays for what they get. For transparency I would like to highlight that I have increased the hourly rate to 80 USD (up from 70 last time). This is the rate that the other developers involved with the project are also charging and thus I hope you find the change appropriate.\n\nKindly take a look at the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cMIzdxSd1Tf9T5KZvVLQfyvn4gxLSuCKGl7JXbOKaoo/edit?usp=sharing) and what we are looking to build with the extra funding. We appreciate any and all feedback.\n\nYou can find the post up for community discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1896).",

      "content": "Full proposal with UI screenshots and all details can be found here: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rnlNk7eka984UXmfNk0Mkdkf94jL1m3aWS8IeedgyY/)\n\nTwitter thread/feedbacks: https://twitter.com/RemarkPunks/status/1587922570828951553\n\n------------------------------\n\n**Summary**\n\nKusaMint is a development kit for NFT artists, collection makers and the whole Kusama community in general. It provides different tools to mint and manage NFTs with ease.\n\nOur goal is to make NFT creation easy for people who don’t have programming skills. Let anyone mint advanced NFTs with an accessible UI which in return will expand the Kusama NFT community with more talented artists and collectors who were scared by the complexity of mints before.\n\nCurrently KusaMint is adjusted for RMRK 2.0, but as development continues, it will scale to RMRK X.0 and other protocols operating in Dotsama.\n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Features**\n\n- ### **2.0 NFT Minter**\nAn easy to use UI that opens a whole new set of possibilities to new users. The minter will constantly expand its functionality and applications as development goes. \n\nCurrently you can create NFTs with multiple types of resources:\n\n1. **Base resource (Parent)** - the main “Base” of your composable NFT. Child resources will be equipped onto it.\n\n2. **Slot resource (Child)** - these resources allow one NFT to be added on the other one. This can result in NFTs with “equipment”, art with multiple layers, different effects and a lot more depending on the user's creativity.\n\n3. **Common** - classic, non-functional resource. \n\nMoreover, our Minter allows to:\nCreate Soulbound NFTs\nInherit metadata from other NFTs\nMass-mint multi-resourced NFTs\nSet royalties and royalty receiver\nMint directly to another wallet or NFT\nReplace and update resources\nCreate and manage your base\n\n- ### **Snapshotter**\n\nCreate collection snapshots in a simple and comfortable way to get a list of every NFT with its holder details (csv/json)\n\n1. **Lite**-  NFTs & Owners \n\n2. **Advanced**-  NFT with details & Owners with identity\n\n- ### **Notification Bot Factory**\n\nIn a few clicks you can create a sales bot that will read remarks and track your collection sales and floor prices. \n\nConfigure your own bots on all the popular social media: Twitter, Discord and Telegram.\n\n-----------------------\n\n- **Details**\n\nFull proposal: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rnlNk7eka984UXmfNk0Mkdkf94jL1m3aWS8IeedgyY)\n\nMore information about our projects: [Link>>](https://canarys-nest.gitbook.io/ultimate-canarys-nest-wiki/ecosystem/canarys-nest)\n\n**First Milestone:**\n\n- RMRK 2.0 NFT Minter\n- Snapshotter\n- Notification Bot Factory\n- Full UI design\n- Integrated Polkadot.js/Talisman Wallets\n\n**Requested Amount:** 1493 KSM/48800 USD (Coingecko data on 2nd of November 2022)\n\n**Total team hours:** 1400 Hours\n\nCosts detalization: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15rnlNk7eka984UXmfNk0Mkdkf94jL1m3aWS8IeedgyY/edit#heading=h.wogmmcdsnfi9)\n\nWe are glad to see feedback on proposal as well as suggestions for extra functionality from the community and hope that this development kit will be useful for many creators in the space.\n\n",

This experiment turned out to be a success so we want to make it something formal and constant.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding for the creation of “Polkadot Forms”, a series of forms and tests, both in English and Spanish, that will allow the community to learn and test their knowledge in a dynamic way. Each form will deal with a specific topic of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem and will be distributed weekly during the months of November, December and January.\n\nThe goal of these test sets is to keep the community active in learning about the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem and motivate them using a healthy and positive contest dynamic. All this to create a formed community and appeal to new users who want to learn in an original and fun way.\n\nYou can see the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14q40d19SVQCyyLPFGdpS5ARJ6qh668YlgujI9RTgcrw/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nFurther community feedback may be found on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/SrSlayer_/status/1580544411661791232?s=20&t=IHaPLGeaAxt3eB7RI_H7Vg).\n\nOriginal post discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1883).",

      "title": "BrightTreasury - adapting to governance 2.0 ",
      "content": "## Description\n\nThe goal of this proposal is to fund adapting BrightTreasury to reflect the Governance 2.0 changes on Kusama. Both governances will coexist in one version of the app, with clear indication of the governance version related to each mechanism.\n\nProject Link : https://treasury.bright.dev\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\n## The team behind it\n\nBright Inventions is a team of over 70 developers, project managers, UX/UI designers and operations specialists - experts in mobile and web applications, systems integration, IOT devices and Blockchain platforms.\n\nWe believe that building a software product is about people working together in a collective way. By offering complex support – mobile and web development as well as IT consultancy we try to eliminate roadblocks towards engaging clients as partners at every step of the process.\n\nWe support startups, digital agencies as well as medium to big businesses. We cooperate with startups, accelerators and incubators. Whatever the client profile is, we always aim to establish a satisfying partnership for both sides. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide.\n\nThe BrightTreasury team currently consists of:\n\nŁukasz Kuderewski - fullstack developer He is an optimist, always willing to learn new things. Mechatronics engineer who fell in love with programming. He has always been interested in a holistic approach to programming problems, which is why after working as a frontend, he is now fulfilled as a fullstack.\n\nRobert Koprowski - fullstack developer, blockchain specialist He is an experienced and ambitious blockchain enthusiast. Graduated from the University of Edinburgh, he lived in various locations around the world to settle now in Gdańsk. Originally a Backend Developer who decided to extend his skills and become Fullstack Developer, always trying to learn something new.\n\nPavel Jankoski - fullstack developer. Communicative team player interested in finding solutions to complex problems. From the very beginning he started working as a fullstack developer and tried many different frameworks which makes him a fast learner eager to uncover new technologies. He enjoys contributing in flexible environments that allow him to explore new cultures, together with colleagues from different countries.\n\nJoanna Cieszyńska - a product designer. She’s passionate about user-centered design and likes to pay attention to the accessibility aspects of it. Just wants to make sure the products she’s responsible for are inclusive and users get equal access to information, functionality, and experience of digital products.\n\nKatarzyna Łukasiewicz - Project Manager. She has been working with agile methods for over 10 years, both as a researcher and a practitioner. She believes in teamwork and a power of user centered mindset. With experience in leading international projects, she knows how to support and encourage timely and high quality deliveries.\n\n## Costs and budget\n\nThe work will be divided into 3 milestones. In each milestone, the whole team, as desribed in the previous section, will be working in Sprints, following Scrum approach. Łukasz and Robert are expected to be engaged full time, Pavel half-time, whereas Katarzyna and Joanna will be engaged part-time. The following cost includes all the necessary development, management and design work to reach the defined goals.\n\n\n**Milestone 1**\n\nDisplay the gov 2.0 proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n\nTime: 3 weeks\nCost: 16 000 USD\n\nThe goal of this milestone is to get the gov 2.0 proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips from chain and display them in BrightTreasury.\n\nThe proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips from both governance versions will be displayed in one overview, with appropriate label: Gov 2.0 or Gov 1.0. They will be sorted by date. Users will be able to filter out only Gov 2.0 or Gov 1.0 proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips as well.\n\nWe plan to complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Checking the gov version support in Kusama net + fetch configuration (when booting the app)\n\n3. List of proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n\n- Fetching proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips from gov2.0 & gov1.0\n- Handling IDs (may be duplicated)\n- Changes in react routing pattern for proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n- Changes in nest controllers for proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n- Front+backend communication\n- Difference in design for two gov versions (label) for proposals/bounties/child bounties/tips\n\nOut of scope - history of Gov 2.0 proposals.\n\n**Milestone 2**\n\nDisplay the gov 2.0 proposal/bounties/tips details\n\n Time: 1 week\nCost: 5 000 USD\n\nThe goal of this milestone is to fetch and display the Gov 2.0 proposal/bounties/tips details.\n\nCurrently in BrightTreasury the results of a motion for a given proposal are presented in the Votings tab, in the proposal’s detailed overview. We’ll keep this form of presentation for both governance versions. When user visits the detailed overview of a Gov 1.0 proposal, the Votings tab will continue to show the results of a motion. When user visits the detailed overview of a Gov 2.0 proposal, the Votings tab will display the results of the appropriate referendum.\n\nWe plan to complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Information on the governance version (label)\n2. Voting results - add the new referenda for Gov 2.0 proposals/bounties/tips\n\n**Milestone 3**\nCreating and converting Idea/Bounty/Tip in the new Governance 2.0 version\n\n\n Time: 2 weeks\nCost: 10 000 USD\n\nThe main goal of this milestone is to allow creating and converting Idea/Bounty/Tip in the new Governance 2.0 version.\n\nUser will be able to choose the governance version, however by default the choice will be set up as Gov 2.0, with information about it being the preferred option. For each governance version, the submission will be handled appropriately.\n\nWe plan to complete the following tasks:\n\n1. Add governance version choice\n2. Calculating bond based on gov version\n3. Handle different calls for each gov version when submitting proposal\n4. Milestones/child bounties Inherit the gov version from their Idea for each network",

      "content": "I am [Ishita-](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishita-sri/) founder of [PolkaSafe](https://polkasafe.xyz/). My background is in engineering and finance and for the last two years, I’ve been working in the crypto VC space. \n\nOver the past few months, I became active in the DAO ecosystem and as I explored the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems - I learned that managing funds via a Multisig is a major pain point for the communities building in the DotSama space because of the lack of a user-friendly Multisig UX. In order to facilitate DAO growth, my team and I are building PolkaSafe on top of Polkadot {.js}'s security backbone while improving all of its current drawbacks.\n\n### Short description \n\nPolkaSafe will be building a user-friendly Multisig wallet UI for the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. With the mission of bringing digital asset users closer to the Dotsama ecosystem and enabling them to safely manage and transfer their tokens, we are focusing on building a product that will provide a great UX for users to interact with the Multisig feature built-in Polkadot.js\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/RhWVcmx/Screenshot-2022-10-11-at-11-57-20-AM.png)\n\nRead the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TJyqo9Py3Tv_N9nw3D1Ggpkxk0ZfHuT9NnnIwMdv1pU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n",

      "content": "Proponent: ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP\n\nDate: 6th October 2022\n\nRequested KSM: 1,295.60 KSM (USD: $59,124.98)\n\nShort description: Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\nPrevious Discussion: <https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1868>\n\nRaw Data: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eftYcA4iedfQiwwekxLvNixhksG3uNMRAU0QGAmI09Y/edit?usp=sharing>\n\nFull Report <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UW9Cg5FmYoxaT2bDCzYOpMuv-LNmzvvayfe0vgEBKlY/edit?usp=sharing>\n\n* * * * *\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (July, August, September 2022) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we've made Github issues based on behaviour we've observed)\n\n## Service Details\n\nDuring the last quarter, we've focused on three key areas for the development of OnFinality - cost optimization, network expansion, and providing more value from our Ultimate API service.\n\nThe bear market has made many of our customers more price sensitive, and as such we've been working with them to optimise our services to provide more for less. We've reduced prices for our larger customers between 30 and 40%, and created products designed to target and onboard new chains with entry level pricing. We've also been working on new rate limiting capabilities to progressively restrict abusers of our public APIs to upgrade to paid API plans.\n\nIn the past quarter we have succeeded in our goal of onboarding two new networks, with the addition of Avalanche and Juno to our API service. This was a large amount of upfront work, extending OnFinality to allow chains outside of Polkadot/Substrate, but now that it has been done we should be able to move faster and onboard new chains each week. We hope that this means that we will be able to invite as many new ecosystem participants into Polkadot as possible with this expansion. \n\nFinally, providing move value from our Ultimate API service has always been a priority, and in this space we've added new API specific paid plans at competitive prices to our competition. We have also delivered the ability for our customers to better understand and learn about their users, with API Insights that tell you where your users are, what they are requesting, what methods are failing (to find bugs in your dApp), and where optimisations can occur.\n\nWe continued to execute on our efforts to provide unprecedented service stability and reliability to this ecosystem. All supported networks exceeded our 99.9% target, including 99.94% uptime for Kusama over the last 90 days . At this stage, OnFinality is operationally striving for four 9s of availability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.\n\nBetween 2022-07-01 and 2022-09-30 our Kusama API service has:\n-   **Reduced cost to the Kusama treasury while serving a similar amount of traffic**\n-   Served a total of 4.932 billion responses\n-   Accumulated almost 56 TB of data egress\n-   The highest daily total was over 102 million responses in a single 24 hour period\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 60 million responses each day.\n-   Statemine had over 364 million API responses in the period\n-   All time totals for Kusama is 35,987,582,620 (35 billion) since November, 2020\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime on Kusama and Statemine was 99.94% and 99.99% respectively\n\n## Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [API Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-introduces-api-insights-so-you-can-analyse-and-learn-about-your-applications-faster/) so you can analyse and learn about your API applications faster and find bugs with your dApp\n-   [Cost optimisations](https://blog.onfinality.io/go-further-with-more-affordable-pricing/) to reduce pricing for our customers by up to 40%\n-   [New API plans](https://blog.onfinality.io/get-ahead-with-onfinalitys-new-api-endpoints/) for our high usage customers and a way to allocate resource to [move towards a more sustainable funding model](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1815)\n-   [Support for Alibaba Cloud](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-collaborates-with-alibaba-cloud-to-provide-a-premium-experience-to-web3-builders/) to provide more decentralised cloud hosting options for our customers\n-   [Updates to our website](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-announces-a-new-ui-to-help-web3-developers-build-smarter/) to include a new Network marketplace so [you can see what networks are supported](https://onfinality.io/marketplace)\n-   Support for new layer 1s - [Avalanche](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-beta-api-support-for-avalanche/) and [Juno](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-api-support-for-jun-c3-b8-network/) (in Cosmos)\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/) and [analytics page](https://analytics.onfinality.io).\n\nFull Report <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UW9Cg5FmYoxaT2bDCzYOpMuv-LNmzvvayfe0vgEBKlY/edit?usp=sharing>",

We agree and are resubmitting based on the feedback that we have received, removing RPC from the equation.\n\nCurrently, this value remained in the proposal:\n\nA Content indexer so that when people searched for educational or articles related to Kusama and Polkadot, we are able to provide a categorization and filtering value to the search result. The target audience is anyone who are interested in the above and wants to join or provide a little touch of their Likes as part of the community feedback to the indexing mechanism. This can be a lurker, a content creator or a technical learner.\n\nThe above will help to gather the information done by many content producers that are being posted in so many repeated location and provided a relevancy.\n\nThe new proposal, which can be found in below link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVOfNDEVJ29KInEzDCIPzPBW9QzavI90HjI2b2jxW1E/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HVOfNDEVJ29KInEzDCIPzPBW9QzavI90HjI2b2jxW1E/)\n\nWe welcome feedback and improvement on the proposal, as at the end of day, the community will be part of us, will also be part of the scalable solution and the enrichment of the data and recommendations.

In terms of the proposal, our team will design and develop a Browser extension application with a widget style interface that is compatible with and similar to (some extent) the Fearless Wallet mobile app (iOS/Android).\n* **A desktop application for Windows, macOS and Linux**. Using Electron SDK it is possible to build Desktop apps for various operating systems with little effort. These desktop apps  can be built from the same code base as the aforementioned Browser extension. \n* **Wallet, network and asset management flows.** We will cover the most important and necessary flows such as: wallet creation and import, handling many wallets, switching between several networks along  with the “All networks” state, The main asset flows such as: send, receive, transaction history,  teleport (cross-chain transfer), buy assets for fiat by means of Moonpay and RAMP services will also be covered.\n* **Settings and chain account management flows.**  Main wallet flows aside, users need to have tools to manage their wallets, chain accounts, localisation, currencies, nodes, etc. The “Settings” set of features will be a solution to that.

These APIs maintain Value transfers/XCM transfers according to DEX info on top  “defi” parachains\n- Model XCM Transfers and Messages across the entire Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem\n- Enhance Polkaholic.io indexing as the Polkadot ecosystem expands: New parachains, new pallets generating XCM extrinsics/messages  with new XC Assets, support for ERC20/PSP22/ERC721/PSP34 assets, XCMv3, and new bridges",

      "content": "Good day,\n\nWe are writing this proposal with regard to some of the experiences that we are getting as a user and/or a validator within the eco-system. We do understand that a lot of help is being proposed by the community members, but at the same time, we have to do our own research in regard to information/news that we are looking forward to.\n\nWhat we want to help the community is to address a typical behavior of Web2 and the nature of our internet environment. IE: INFORMATION is \"ALL Over The Place\" from either Blogs, video site, other blogs and blogs and discussion website and sometime, social media.\n\nThere are 2 values in this proposal\n\nA Content indexer so that when people searched for educational or articles related to Kusama and Polkadot, we are able to provide a categorization and filtering value to the search result. The target audience is anyone who are interested in the above and wants to join or provide a little touch of their Likes as part of the community feedback to the indexing mechanism. This can be a lurker, a content creator or a technical learner.\n\nThe above will help to gather the information done by many content producers that are being posted in so many repeated location and provided a relevancy.\n\nRPC nodes for community which we simply want to provide more capabilities to the community and infrastructure as the usage of XCM is increasing dramatically now. In addition to that, the focus will be on Asia and North America because majority of the existing RPC are in Europe. Furthermore, we are also delivering additional archive nodes to reinforce the data footprint of the decentralized eco-system.\n\nOur current Full Proposal can be found below. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LXxklsulLc87ffkwHPzfgfQwB86efytHl2SoatRXnU](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19LXxklsulLc87ffkwHPzfgfQwB86efytHl2SoatRXnU)\n\nWe welcome feedback and improvement on the proposal, as at the end of day, the community will be part of us, will also be part of the scalable solution and the enrichment of the data and recommendations. We also want to offer transparency to the proposal. Afterall, this is supported and funded by the community.",

It was built with the Dotsama ecosystem in mind and tailored to benefit its most active members. Since then, Sub.ID has been connected to over 30 Substrate chains, gained substantial traction, and got its own dedicated vision and roadmap.\n\nWe are seeking to secure funding from Kusama treasury for the following community-oriented features:\n\nBATCH ONE\n- **Collator and validator staking**: network selection, stake / unstake buttons and actions, collators / validators list, parachain / FRAME staking pallets support\n- **Staking dashboard**: staking analytics, data aggregation, APR calculation, rewards calculation\n- **Crowdloan claims**: claim buttons and actions, claim/vesting pallets support (backend/frontend), human friendly time to unlock staked tokens\n- **Cross-chain transfers**: native & cross-chain transfers (UX/frontend), tokens pallets support (native transfer), XCM pallet integration, support of EVM tokens & transfers\n\nBATCH TWO\n- Alternative balance view\n- Accounts grouping\n- Transaction history\n- P&L analytics\n\nBATCH THREE\n- Mobile app\n\nThe first allocation will only cover BATCH ONE features for now, the rest are our plans for the future.\n\nPlease review the full proposal with detailed description costs at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RElvy5RYhnNInwnGsjibedGLI3EeBoqqazKk6Syv13M/view](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RElvy5RYhnNInwnGsjibedGLI3EeBoqqazKk6Syv13M/view).

      "title": "Proposal: Dubbing “Polkadot Decoded 2022” playlist into Spanish",
      "content": "**Who?**\n\nI'm Sara and I've been dubbing the official Polkadot videos into Spanish for 9 months on the YouTube channel called [Polkadot & Kusama - Doblaje al español](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhalsQc7NrYCvYkietak7A). During the first months I was applying to Tips on Kusama’s Treasury, and for the last 3 months I’ve been working on a [Child Bounty](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hqm_CM8QRvvTNuxMnz4FbvX5A9C_esEWo51pEtD0mfk/edit?usp=sharing). In this proposal I’ll be working with 2 more experienced translators, and with Cervera, who will be in charge of editing the videos.\n\n**What?**\n\nDubbing of [Polkadot Decoded 2022 playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGvcE0HKKnORiFqWNv5onxCf) into Spanish. The Polkadot Decoded 2022 playlist has more than 100 videos that are equivalent to 34 hours of viewing in total.\n\n**When?**\n\nFrom October to January 2023. It’s important that the Spanish-speaking community has the content of the Decoded 2022 event as soon as possible to be aware of the news of the ecosystem.\n\n**Why?**\n\n- Misinformation. One of the most important things is that the community is informed and aware of the technology so that they can participate in it.\n\n- Lack of English proficiency in the Spanish-speaking community. According to the EF English Proficiency Index (EF EPI), 60.6% of the Spanish-speaking population have low/moderate English proficiency. The remaining percentage is not fluent in English.\n\n- Little content about Polkadot in Spanish. Most of the content about Polkadot and its ecosystem is in English.\n\n- Content subtitled, but not dubbed. Dubbing offers users greater convenience because they don’t have to follow the reading with their eyes.\n\n- Blind Spanish-speaking people who aren’t proficient in English don’t have access to information. From experience in my family, Spanish-speaking blind people who aren’t proficient in English and want to learn need audio content in Spanish about the ecosystem.\n\n- Information may be distorted when passing through third parties. This causes the user to be misinformed.\n\n**Amount requested:**\n1,158.47 KSM ($51,158.3) (KSM/USD on the EMA7 on Subscan at the time of submission)\n\n**Marketing & Success metrics:**\nSEO. Reach an average of 250k views in total with all episodes. These videos will be accessible to any user through the Polkadot & Kusama - Doblaje al español channel, and will be available for any member to share through other channels and/or platforms (such as Polkadot Hub or the Polkadot en Español channel on YouTube).\n\n**More information? See the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NCRXMI_woMHK6hhXKmr6jTss-sbSQOotH1QI55PP1Vw/edit?usp=sharing)!**\n\nOriginal post discussions can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1780).",

      "title": "Polkadot js plus 1st treasury proposal",
      "content": "**Polkadot js plus extension**, or for short Plus, is Polkadot js extension, plus new features. It is a user-friendly wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains/parachains through a browser. It allows users to access their account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps.\nPlus is based on Polkadot js extension, and gets constantly updated with it. Plus does whatever the original extension does and more.\n\n![PJP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/main/intro.png)\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe reason why we have decided to work on this project is because every day users comment on social media complaining about the complexity of the original application: \"why the extension does not show the balance?\", \"It is too complicated for new/average users to work with\", \"It is too abstract\", \" why should we go to another web site to work with the extension?\", \" how could contribute to the crowdloans via extension?\", and so on. Hence, we started to work on the Plus extension to address such concerns/requests from the Polkadot community.\n\n**Polkadot js Plus features**\n\nThe following features are currently available in Polkadot js Plus extension:\n\n\n1. View balances (crypto/USD) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#accounts-page))\n2. Transfer funds ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#transfer-funds))\n3. View transaction history ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#transactions-history))\n4. View an address as a QR code ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#qr-code))\n5. **Regular staking** (stake, unstake, rebag, redeem, nominate, view rewards history, etc)  ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#easy-staking))\n6. **Nomination Pools** (join/create pool, stake, unstake, redeem, nominate, manage pool, etc) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#easy-staking))\n7. Supporting different endpoints ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#social-recovery))\n8. Crowdloans (View Auctions/crowdloans/contributions and contribute to crowdloans) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#crowdloans))\n9. **Governance** (vote referendums, endorse proposals, vote/unvote councils, view motions, view/submit treasury proposals and view/submit tips) ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#governance))\n10. **Social account recovery** ([link](https://github.com/Nick-1979/polkadot-Js-Plus-extension/wiki/How-To's#social-recovery))\n\n\n**Problem statement**\n\nPolkadot js Plus team aims to provide additional new features, and the budget is requested for the development of the 1st milestone:\n\nMilestone 1:\n\n- Re-developing of the current features by completely redesigning of the extension‘s UI/UX: Until now, we were mostly focused on bringing new functionalities to the Polkadot js Plus extension, and tried to be consistent with the UI of the Polkadot official extension. Even though we have received positive feedback from the community, we noticed that the community also wants a new design and user experience. Hence, we have decided to completely redesign the extension, to make users feel more comfortable and focus on what's important, by creating a stylized but instantly recognizable UI. In addition, users be able to efficiently and quickly get most of the common functionalities done on Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem blockchains. Furthermore, we rename the extension to “Polkagate”, to be as the gateway to Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n![polkagate](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nick-1979/PolkadotJsPlusPictures/553705cdf85d222b3e9126a715cc122a2fa5ade3/polkagate/intro.png)\n\n- Nomination pools (Phase 2): Nomination pools as a new feature of the Substrate is currently implemented on Kusama, and Polkadot js Plus is among the first wallets to provide this feature for the community. The nomination pool is a work in progress, where some new features are on the list to be added to the blockchain, and also there are some currently added features like “kicking all members out when pool is destroying” and no UI are currently supporting those features. We want to add the nomination pools new features which is not currently available in the extension, such as facilities around Blocked and Destroying state where: If the pool state is in Blocked, and you are the state_toggler or root role, then you should be able to unbond and withdraw anyone else, and if the pool state is in Destroying, then anyone should be able to unbond and withdraw anyone, except the depositor.\n\n- Proxy accounts support: Proxies are a great feature because they add in a layer of security to the Polkadot ecosystem. Rather than using funds in one sole account, smaller accounts with predefined roles complete tasks for the main account. But using this great feature is difficult for users.\nAs quoted by two councilors below, there is a lot of enthusiasm for using proxies, but almost no support from extensions.\n**Will (Paradox)** on Element: “I would love it if I could add a 'proxy only' account in Polkadot.JS/extension, it would require the public address of the real account and the private keys for a proxy account. Any transactions would be signed by the proxy on behalf of the real”. \n**Bryan Chen** on twitter: “Proxy account is such an underrated feature that can significantly improve account security but we have virtually zero support on this amazing feature. It will be great if we can use this feature without switching browser extensions.”\nWe want to add the support of proxy accounts to the extension so that users can easily create and utilize proxy accounts while minimizing the risk of their main/stash account.\n\n\nMilestone 2:\n\n- Governance 2 (Phase 1): Almost all of the governance features are currently included in the Polkadot js Plus extension, we would like to have Governance 2 features in the extension as well. Community involvement is still low in governance activities like democracy voting. Sometimes proposals are very technical, and sometimes users may not be available in the voting period to vote. Providing vote delegation besides all governance facilities in Polkadot js Plus extension, will increase the tokens participated in different Governance voting activities. \n\n\n- Identity management: Identities exist on-chain but cannot be seen on the extension’s account page, we will bring the Identities into the extension. Accounts’ names in the extension may differ from their on-chain identities, and this may be inconvenient to distinguish which identity belongs to which name/Id. The problem will be more for users with multiple accounts. Moreover, in social recovery, when you lose your account, most probably you cannot remember the address! By integrating the Identity management into the extension, users not only can easily set their identities but also request judgements using the extension. In addition, using the on-chain identity instead of the local name of accounts, makes the accounts management more convenient. Identities also help social recovery be more user-friendly for users. \n\n- Light client integration: We would like to provide the Polkadot light client as an end point in the extension, which will make the extension much more standalone, and help the ecosystem to be more decentralized. If blockchain endpoints stop servicing for whatever reason, since no data can be fetched from them, hence all extensions and wallets would be useless. Integrating the light client inside the extension not only helps to distribute the Polkadot ecosystem more but also lets the extension operate while all existing endpoints stop servicing. However, we need to consider the sync waiting time when using the light client.\n\n**Incorporating community feedback** ([link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1764)):\n\nBased on the comments and the discussion on the Kusama Direction channel, we have modified the proposal as follows:\n\n - we have reduced the redesign section budget by approximately 42% through:\n      -  reusing parts of the codes\n      -  moving 2 of 10 current features/items for re-developement to milestone 2\n\n  - we have replaced the word \"redesign\" with \"re-develop\" which makes more sense\n  - we have moved \"identity management\" from milestone 1 to 2\n  - we have added \"Proxy accounts support\" as a more critical feature to milestone 1\n\nHere you can find the [Revised proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11JGzIuiTfNA5KwKisKB6I-NDQeOXnasn). \nThe [previous version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10T9l6lw4mgjz9rF_Ckhpr8fTgoxHFJkL) is also available for comparison and transparency.\n\n\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPolkadot js Plus team",

      "content": "Proposal to fund several events during Berlin Blockchain Week Sep. 12th - 18th.\n\nThis proposal is a community led proposal, led by several parachains that have shown high interest in being part of the organizing team of this proposal. KILT Protocol, Phala Network, Subsquid, Crust Network, Bifrost, Basilisk and others came together to lay out a week full of Polkadot ecosystem events and educational content.\n\nInstead of organizing a full one- or two-day conference as it has been done for example during EthCC in Paris, the organizer team decided to approach it in a different way and make use of the full seven days of Berlin Blockchain Week.\n\nThe goal is to organize every day a Polkadot specific event based on a different ecosystem topic (Cloud services, UI/UX in DeFi, NFT & metaverse infra, Polkadot updates). Every event is organized in a different style (from boat party to panel discussion and NFT art gallery event) to show the diversity of our ecosystem and use every day of the blockchain week to promote the Polkadot brand.\nEvents will be live streamed and published on Polkadots official crowdcast. All events are communicated with the official Berlin Blockchain Week events organization TG channel and will be also published on the official events calendar.\n\n**Note regarding beneficiary address:**\n\nDue to the fact that the individuals representing different parachains submitting this proposal are unable to off-ramp the KSM to pay the cost of the event. The Parity Finance will assist by helping off-ramp the KSM and pay for cost of the events. None of the funds will go to Parity directly.\n\nPlease see the full proposal here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lNnZesUGUTBpr4k9fHLbr61J8qSWppc1/edit\n\nblockchainweek.berlin (https://blockchainweek.berlin/)",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nWe're proud to present our very first proposal from the Sublab team which primary focus is on developing tools for developers in Substrate ecosystem.\n\nPlease feel free to read the full proposal document at this link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvQw2bf2uH3qEJR2594Hj5FtmsxbcaKoodZYyKwJkx4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvQw2bf2uH3qEJR2594Hj5FtmsxbcaKoodZYyKwJkx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://sublab.dev/logo.png)\n\n**Context of proposal**\n\n[sublab.dev](sublab.dev) is the company designated to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community. \n\nWe’re a team of 3 engineers at this moment, consisting of 1 Senior iOS Engineer; 1 Support Engineer; and former [Fearless Wallet](http://fearlesswallet.io) Technical Lead, proficient in both iOS and Android development since 2010, who led Mobile Departments in several companies, including his own, and knows everything about mobile apps architecture. Our goal is to reach the current state of ecosystem needs in our libraries as soon as possible, starting with a few people to build a strong and reliable foundation to be used further to develop as many APIs and different chain clients as possible. Last, but not least, we want to provide technical support in our Telegram chat for developers having questions about integration to their mobile apps.\n\nRight now, we would love to start with the development of SCALE codec as this is the one of the basic dependencies to do anything in the ecosystem. As stated in [Substrate Docs](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/advanced/scale-codec/#implementations) there are no existing ready-to-use libraries for this purpose in Swift or Kotlin. Even though such implementations already exist in a couple of live mobile wallets, it’s not covered with documentation, has outdated unit-tests, and strongly tied to existing libraries codebase which are very specific for wallets needs. And then finalize the current milestone with basic Substrate client implementation.\n\n**What we're trying to accomplish within this milestone**\n\nRight now there are only a few mobile apps in the ecosystem, and almost no ready-to-use tools for new players in the market. Existing apps share their source code, but it would take huge efforts and a big amount of time for even very strong developers to dive into the ecosystem development, because if they’re not familiar with the ecosystem philosophy and technical aspects, they will definitely need to learn from the beginning. So, basically speaking, only the strongest developers could easily (or not so) step into the development inside the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. \n\nThus, as we see it, to make it possible for the ecosystem to grow more and attract more mobile developers to it, there is a need for strong, reliable, open-source, well documented libraries to kickstart more innovative projects. **With the tool set of easy-to-use transparent libraries, we believe that the entry threshold into the ecosystem will fall down and will let even more developers start working with it.**\n\nExisting SCALE codec implementations for mobile platforms do not provide any documentation, have outdated unit-tests, have a redundant interlayer of JSON key-based serialization which is a specific requirement for their app needs, though not follow pure SCALE responsibility and designation. \n\nAt the very beginning, we want to solve this problem by making fully native open-source libraries which give both options to end developers: \n\n- Work with SCALE codec as it was designed\n- Work with SCALE codec by slight transformation with interlayer between\n\nOn top of it, we’re planning to build **Substrate client libraries**, which by using the SCALE toolset will cover basic messaging with any potential Substrate-based network. At this stage, we would like to exclude the signature routine from this library, because this requires more time to make architectural solutions regarding support of different signature methods and how to properly inject them depending on various chains already out there. However an existing set of signatures in the ecosystem by the date of publication will be supported within this milestone.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nWe want the Substrate ecosystem developers to just do brand new features to make the ecosystem richer and be recognizable by even more people around the globe, while we can hold their backs by doing a great infrastructural work. We want to see more mobile apps in the ecosystem either from existing parachains to launch their own apps or absolutely new mobile wallets with more innovative functions. Same we want to help existing applications by solving their core issues within our works and help them adopt our products. Also we aim to partner with as much as possible existing networks and/or companies who already deliver their services to ecosystem, so that even their products might be easy accessible via reliable SDKs.\n\n**Proposal financing and deliverables**\n\nWe're requesting $81,900 for the current milestone which includes both SCALE codec implementation and Substrate client library implementation. Both parts are planned to be released separately and sequentially along with publications to public package managers' repositories, as well as on our GitHub for a review. Also we're planning announcements on our Telegram channel and future Medium blog with a brief description of deliverables. And in the end when we finish documentation part we're going to publish on-chain report with appropriate links to the open source code, package managers' repositories, our articles on Medium, and links to documentation website.\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you any constructive feedback and/or questions regarding our planned works. Feel free to refer to our [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cvQw2bf2uH3qEJR2594Hj5FtmsxbcaKoodZYyKwJkx4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nSincerely,\nSublab team",

      "content": "> **Proponent:**\nBlockchain Rio 2022\n\n> **KSM Account:**\nEiUauQdEZkF4WxiuUw8hP5VtwFxGkRmrhL2hskdgE6RnNeK\n\n**Contact:** \nEduardo Cardoso (Executive Producer)\necardoso@polkadot.com.br //// Discord: _ecardo5o#3065\n\nDate: 13 August 2022\n \nCurrently planning to have the event beginning on September 01, 2022. Ideally, to receive the fund as soon as possible. \n\n> The deadline for knowing whether or not the Council approves this initiative is August 19, after which there will be no conditions for its execution in time. \n\nOnce this proposal is approved, we will start our initial expenses with liquidity provided by Francisco Carvalho (organizer of Blockchain Rio) and as soon as the resources are available we will have to carry out this reimbursement.\n\n**Requested KSM:**\n$244,043.80 USD (3,998.75 KSMs)\n\n**KSM Value:**\n$61,03 USD (calculated by the 7 day average rate on 13/08/2022)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/vmbNRCN/Captura-de-Tela-2022-07-14-a-s-04-54-34.png) \n\n> The citation of People, Institutions and Projects in this proposal is for DOCUMENTARY nature only and DOES NOT MEAN any kind of ADHESION, PREVIOUS SUPPORT or that the ideas presented here ARE NOT SUBJECT TO QUESTIONS. This is an inclusive Proposal. Our production will be open to anyone who wants to expose their projects and ideas, whether they are Ambassadors or Representatives of Parachains, Dapps and Teams. Just get in touch by email: contato@polkadot.com.br. \n\nThis proposal is the result of two months of intense discussions involving its developers and also a lot of feedback that came from members of Parity, WEB3 Foundation, the Council, the Ambassador Program, Parachains and DAPPs, journalists, local audiences, as well many specialist professionals in working within the ecosystem.\n\n> The first challenge after so much feedback is reconciling so many different views and expectations. It is simply not possible to please everyone. And between so many extremes we decided to follow a path that remains viable and that we believe will be the one that will give the best results.\n\n[Blockchain Rio](https://www.blockchainrio.com.br/) ([https://www.blockchainrio.com.br/](https://www.blockchainrio.com.br/)) is a very rare opportunity in Brazil. To establish ties with corporate, institutional and government decision-makers. And also to make contact with students (college, university and even postgraduates), developers and creative professionals. All of it is in a country of continental size marked by a festive culture and which is open to understanding and applying our knowledge.\n\nSo far, there is no other event in Brazil or even LATAM that has managed to gather so many guests (more than 250) that represents multiple sectors interested in this market, promoting a cross dialogue between them. And our planning captures this concept very well, making DOTSAMA appropriate this narrative about the future of WEB3.\n\n**LATAM Let's Grow with DOTSAMA!**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/B3x2jKh/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-51-41.png)\n**Full Proposal (FINAL VERSION)**\n-[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUZLS1EBICh9yzUDC5ayw31lsYvOqUW_t2Vcn8I_YaE/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BUZLS1EBICh9yzUDC5ayw31lsYvOqUW_t2Vcn8I_YaE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Pré-Proposal for Discussion**\n- [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1742](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1742)\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/0Cxt0pz/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-51-21.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/T1CGQw9/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-51-04.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/VLLLh7f/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-50-43.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/YjDhxjn/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-50-23.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/ws5bk7H/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-49-57.png)\n![](https://i.ibb.co/WHdFwsj/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-49-39.png)\n\n\n\n**The Proponent of this Project is a Multisign formed by:**\n\n**Francisco Carvalho** - Founder and Ceo of Vision Realty (Real State) and Blockchain Rio. Specialist in Blockchain at MIT, he is also an Advisory Board Member in Venture Capital: Crypto Valey Associate.\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-carvalho-706b2bb5/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-carvalho-706b2bb5/)\n\n**Eduardo Cardoso (ECARDO5O)** - Creative and Project Director since 1998, elected member of the GLMR APES DAO's Council (the top 1 NFT collection on Moonbeam Network). He has been working as a Communication Consultant and Product Planner in the Traditional Financial Market for over 20 years, accumulating awards in Brazil and abroad. Regularly contributed to the development of the ecosystem as a Speaker, Editor (polkadot.com.br) and also as one of the Creative Directors at the Kappa Sigma Mu Society Brand Project. On Youtube, he collaborates on the Polkadot Brasil, Polkadot Spanish and PolkaCortes channels and has had 2 award-winning pieces in animation (for Astar and Parallel) in the Polkadot Year-End Contest (2021 edition).\n- [https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-cardoso-perfil/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-cardoso-perfil/)\n\n**Tiago Lucer** - Systems architect, Educator, Project analyst and one of the founders of the DOTSAMA Community in Brazil. He will give the final approval on the financial outflows of this wallet and will act as an observer of the Community regarding the applicability of the funds to fulfill the objectives of this Proposal.\n\n> This Proposal was only possible because of the constant, fast and accurate support of the Organizers of Blockchain Rio, Hacking Rio, Rio Crypto Hub, Brasil NFT and Código Brazuca (Educational Program responsible for the first two permanent nodes for Kusama and Polkadot in Rio). All these collectives form the core of the main initiatives involving WEB3 in the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/WPkXdBt/Captura-de-Tela-2022-08-13-a-s-00-49-00.png)",

      "title": "Bounty #3 Top-up Request",
      "content": "## Overview\n\n[Bounty #3](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/3) aims to provide a signing solution to bridge the dApps and mobile wallets, which using Beacon Network as a decentralized peer-to-peer network of nodes based on the matrix protocol, with trustless and encrypted message relaying.\n\nThe bounty includes the integration with Beacon SDK with Substrate-based Network, and the integration with Wallet in both iOS and Android. Overall the bounty is completed by the Beacon team, Fearless Wallet team, and Nova Wallet by June 2022.\n\nThe bounty includes relatively more work which could be split into different stages. In order to cover the financial risk for the development team, we decide to split the distribution of the bounty into 2 parts. The first part is distributed(on [Subscan](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6)) in November 2021 and rest of KSM is hold in a multi-sig wallet on KSM: FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6. In June 2022, the rest of the bounty is completed, but the remaining KSM in the bounty can't cover the cost because the KSM price drops in 2022.\n\nAs the curator of the bounty, hereby I kindly ask the council to approve the request to top up 1543.17 KSM into the bounty according to the calculation.  \n\n![Time Spent Table](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/main/res/TimeSpent.png)\n\n## Reviews\n\nFor the detail of the review of bounty 3 please refer to: \n* [Review of Part 1 on 2021 October - Beacon](https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/blob/main/Submission/202110Beacon_Review.md)\n* [Review of Part 1 on 2021 October - Fearless Wallet](https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/blob/main/Submission/202110Fearless_Submission_Review.md)\n* [Review of Part 2 on 2022 June](https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/blob/main/Submission/202206Review.md)\n\n## Bounty Distribution Recap\n\nThe reward of the bounty is paid in two parts due to the size of the work being big which may introduce financial risk to the teams if we only distribute the reward by the completion of the bounty. \n\nThe first part is summarized in: https://github.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/tree/main/Submission and is distributed by the multi-sig account FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6 with 394.328 KSM, the rest KSM reserved for part2 is 694.552 KSM.\n\nThe discussion is followed on [Polkassembly](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/bounty/3#75f2df36-575c-4a1e-973d-426fc01542b1)\n![First Part Comment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hanwencheng/Substrate-Mobile-Injector/main/res/firstPart.png)\n\nThe multi-sig wallet is currently handled by 4 accounts for transparency, two from me, one from Pascal of the Beacon team, and one from Anton of the Fearless/Nova team.\n\nTo be noticed here. Anton was a team member of the Fearless Wallet team and during the development, he switched his role to only the present Nova team due to the reconstruction of the companies. Anton's role in the multi-sig is not changed as he consistently worked for the bounty and provided useful insights for both teams. This is under the agreement of both the Nova and the Fearless Wallet team, and does not introduce any conflict into the reward distribution.\n\n## Refill KSM \n\nDue to the volatility of KSM(The KSM price is 368 USD when we distribute the first part of the bounty, now 61.351 USD), we need to add more KSM into the bounty in order to cover the cost of the second part of the bounty.\n\nAccording to the calculation, we still need 1543.17 KSM.\n\nThe KSM will first send to the multi-sig account FC4tZgWUDpg1AK5uoY7Z9bTaUanemyipoG7Tk8W9YXpxvZ6, which is also the original beneficiary of bounty #3. and be further distributed to:\n* Beacon team (Paper AG): G4bxLcMawBgsCt3Qj1khSyS1MxorfyHbUXrFyjQ6zySbTrs\n* Nova Foundation: H3cSNjAW86NfTecufGPhxutea8KrEcZdPa4XgVKfhTMugej\n* SORAMITSU(Fearless Wallet): FyLYnuNoMAVkz1VZMMGZFHDPghQQm1916fCon1CqNt2aXbX\n\n### Future Plan\n\nCurrently, the adoption of Beacon Protocol in Polkadot Ecosystem is strongly dependent on the decision if dApps want to integrate Beacon SDK. We find a better way to gain adoption is to integrate the Beacon SDK in the Polkadot.js extension as almost every dApp supports Polkadot.js/extension to connect the wallet. It is also beneficial for dApps because they do not need to extra effort to integrate with Beacon.\n\nSo there is some extra work to do on Polkadot.js/extension, the plan is detailed in the Github issue [here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension/issues/989)\n\nThe beacon team will work closely with Polkadot.js/extension team to make this happen, and apply for a new bounty when it is necessary.\n\n### Contact Information\n* Curator: Hanwen Cheng hanwen@litentry.com\n* Beacon Network: Pascal p.brun@papers.ch \n* Nova Wallet: anton@novawallet.io\n* Fearless Wallet: petrov@soramitsu.co.jp\n",

From simple network status dashboards, to a list of validators with several para-validator key data points, real-time charts, as well as backend service that aggregates on-chain data from the *backing subsystem parachains protocol* and build *RESTful and WebSocket APIs* to create a seamless user experience.\n\nThis proposal also aims to cover ongoing maintenance and operational costs of ONE-T. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/kjMU0ND.jpg)\n\nAlpha Prototype: [apps.turboflakes.io](https://apps.turboflakes.io/#/one-t/kusama/parachains/overview)\n\n---\n\nONE-T is generating reports daily since April 2022. These reports are currently only available on matrix and at the time of writing, for Kusama and Polkadot combined, ONE-T gathered over the past three months **more than 170 members** on both public rooms. There are **more than 250 validator report subscriptions active** and is sending on average more than **600 reports a day** to subscribers.\n\nThe full proposal with a detailed description and costs can be found here: [https://hackmd.io/@turboflakes/BJ2i1pz3q](https://hackmd.io/@turboflakes/BJ2i1pz3q).\n\nAny feedback is welcome.\n\nPlease review our [full proposal](https://hackmd.io/@turboflakes/BJ2i1pz3q).",

      "title": "SNI Hackathon with Kenya Wildlife Trust: Treasury Proposal",
      "content": "Overview\n--------\n\n**The Sovereign Nature Initiative**\n\n[Sovereign Nature Initiative](https://sovereignnature.com/) (SNI) is a non-profit foundation that has brought together multiple partners and engineers from the Kusama ecosystem including [Kodadot](https://nft.kodadot.xyz/), [Unique Network](https://unique.network), [Kilt Protocol](https://kilt.io), [Momentum](https://odyssey.org/explore-momentum), and [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), to support the building of Web3 capacities for wildlife conservancies and other NGOs working on restoring and protecting biodiverse ecosystems.\n\nSNI's KWT Hackathon is an online event for crowdsourcing solutions for wild-life identification with computer-vision techniques and onboarding these identities on web3 data and ssi protocols, as well as presenting these identities in different ways in the metaverse. This effort has a major impact on conservation, which currently disposes of manual techniques, taking up to 6 months to process, resulting in siloed physical profiles.\n\n**Venue:** Odyssey Momentum online Hackathon space: sni.odyssey.org\n\n**Hackathon Dates:** October the  7th until November the 6th\n\n**Winners Announcement:** Tuesday the 7th of November\n\nCandidates should apply before the 12th of September 2022 by completing [this form.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd22MYldgFgyxj0HX5CaIq7CIAgzs8y_6gDhnM4gaupipMrjw/viewform?usp=sf_link) \n\nWe will let applicants know if they are invited or not by the 16th of September 2022. \n\n**Beneficiary address:**\nG2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\n**Submitter address:**\nG2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\nCommunity Spend & Deliverables\n------------------------------\n\nThe pledges we are seeking from the Council will provide prizes to enhance the reach and impact of these project -- 320 KSM in prizes for the winners of the contests, which will encourage them to continue building their DApps to full fruition after the Hackathon for the benefit of KWT and other conservancies around the world dealing with similar challenges (see description below).\n\n### Amount to spend from the community pool\n\n**Total Ask: 320 KSM**\n\n**Distribution:**\n\n-   80 KSM to the first 2 Winners (1 winner per challenge)\n\n-   48 KSM to the first 2 Runners-up (1 runners-up per challenge)\n\n-   60 KSM to be equally divided amongst the remaining teams\n\nThe Jury will be composed of representatives of KWT, SNI, and 2 experts from the field of technology and conservation. The Jury will select 4 winners to which it will distribute such an amount. In its decision, the Jury will be looking for novelty, ease of implementation with existing technologies, the degree of impact and efficiency the solution brings to the conservancies' operations, and other relevant factors such as cost of implementation etc.\n\nIntroduction to the KWT Hackathon, the Challenges & Ecosystem Growth opportunities\n\nThe Web3 for nature restoration and conservation space is growing exponentially, with Hackathons, grants, and investments flooding into this emerging ecosystem. The aim of this Web3 movement is to bring forward the development of tools and token economic models that could support NGOs and other wildlife conservation organizations to find alternative solutions to finance and manage their vital work of protecting and restoring wildlife ecosystems.\n\nThis space, loosely defined often as ReFi, Regen Community, or Web3 for Nature is currently led by Ethereum, Polygon, and by the work of Regen.Network which is part of the Cosmos ecosystem.\n\nSovereign Nature Initiative is recognized as a leading node in such an ecosystem and together with strategic partners such as Kilt Protocol, KodaDOT, Bitgreen, Momentum, and Unique.Network is trying to advocate for the use of the Kusama ecosystem as the \"go-to\" chain for environmental projects due to its recognized lowest carbon footprint in the market, and its federated framework for governance and decision-making, which are vital features for conservancies and other land stewards. \n\nTo foster innovation in the ecosystem that is both beneficial for the network and builds capacity for nature stewards working in the field, SNI hosts online Hackathons and [Incubators](https://sovereignnature.com/programs/germinators-program) in partnership with conservancies globally.\n\nBuilding on the success of our latest [competition](https://sovereignnature.com/winter-2022-hackathon-challenge) supported by the [Treasury](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/425), and our recent [May 2022 Experimental Zone](https://sovereignnature.com/tpost/52pojp8lo1-reflections-on-experimental-zone-1) in Amsterdam, in October-November this year we will again be inviting the most talented Web3 teams from around the world to build tech in service to the health and balance of life on our planet.\n\nIn this iteration, we are partnering with the [Kenya Wildlife Trust](https://www.kenyawildlifetrust.org/) (KWT), an NGO committed to the protection and conservation of predators and their ecology, situated in the Maasai Mara National park in southwestern Kenya.\n\nKWT, aware of the potential of emerging decentralized technologies, has identified two specific problems they invite teams to tackle:\n\n-   The identification of lions through computer vision models\n\n-   Predators and farmers' conflict management through spatio-temporal prediction modeling and other conflict mitigation approaches\n\nImproving the lions' Identification process and ID management\n\nA significant portion of KWT's resources is spent on the identification of predators in the Maasai Mara ecosystem. These identifications allow staff to monitor the population and  create model-density estimates and distribution trends, data which are essential for conservation. Due to their physical characteristics, individual lions are more challenging to identify than other predators and the images are painstakingly screened and processed by three employees.\n\nThis challenge is a fantastic opportunity to develop the capabilities of protocols and teams working on verifiable credentials such as our partners at Kilt Protocol.\n\n### Predators and farmers' conflict mitigation\n\nThe survival of predators in a mixed-use landscape like the Maasai Mara depends upon the goodwill of people to coexist with other non-human and undomesticated life. In the Maasai Mara ecosystem, farmers and wildlife live in close proximity, and predators often prey on cattle. Successful measures have been taken to build better protection and deterrent mechanisms. Still, KWT knows that more can be done to create truly resilient means to support cohabitation, which considers both the socio-economical context and the everyday life of farmers' communities. We, therefore, invite teams to harness their creativity, skills, and expertise toward building tools that can serve as facilitators of a new symbiotic relationship between human communities and predators.\n\nIdeas might include, but should not be limited to, providing the technological and economic tools for communities to safely cohabit with predators, and creating the conditions for farmers to understand the importance of predators, and participate in the value predators generate by regulating the complex dynamics of the savanna ecosystem.\n\nThis is a wonderful opportunity for protocols and teams working on data markets and IoT to validate and expand the use cases of their technology. For example, machine learning can be done using Ocean Protocol Compute-To-Data service which will allow us to hide lion tracking data from the public while opening it to data processing and prediction modeling.\n\n### Target Group\n\nIdeal participants are labs, startups, collectives, or companies with a heart for conservation, an ambition to build life-sustaining systems, and who are well versed in some or all of the following technology stack:\n\n-   Web3 - wildlife and biodiversity data oracles.\n\n-   Token Engineering - crypto native models for conservancies funds distribution.\n\n-   Spatio-temporal prediction modeling - wildlife mobility predictions and human-wildlife conflict mitigation.\n\n-   Citizen Science - applications for wildlife tracking and identification.\n\n-   Computer Vision models for wild animals recognition, identification, and tracking.\n\nPrevious experience working on similar conservation projects is desired but not required.\n\n**Maximum Team Size: 8 members**\n\nOur intention is to have at least half of the participants based in the African continent. We foresee this being an excellent opportunity for Kusama to grow its ecosystem in the East-African region, which is currently dominated by other protocols and their respective supporting communities.\n\n**Open Source**\n\nNature doesn't care about ownership. In the spirit of open collaboration, all software developed during the Hackathon should be licensed under Open Source license.",

      "content": "> This is a follow up proposal to what we submitted before:\n\n> [#94 Cloudflare Enterprise Plan for Subscan from January 2022 to April 2022](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/94)\n\n> [#95 The Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot Network from Sep 2021 to Dec 2021](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/95)\n\nThis proposal is used to pay the infrastructure costs of the Polkadot network and its testnets. The payment involved in this proposal does not include any software development, human resources, etc. \n\nPreviously, every infrastructure cost of Subscan was applied by submitting treasury proposals separately. The application time was asynchronous and the process was complicated, which is easy to cause some confusion to users, and it is inconvenient to clearly obtain the monthly cost. Therefore , this application will count all unpaid infrastructure costs of the polkadot network before June 30, 2022, including:\n\n- GCP: January 1st - June 30th\n- Datadog: January 1st - June 30th\n- Cloudflare: April 15th - June 30th\n\nIn the future, the billing time of all bills will be completely unified, which is more convenient for community management and supervision.\n\nThis time, we plan to apply for **13,091 USD in Kusama**, the amount of KSM will be converted based on the **EMA7 price** on the day of the official submission.  \n\n- 2022-07-27 10:59:00 (+UTC), Block #13743315\n- KSM EMA7 Price ( USD ): 60.151;\n- Number of KSM: 217.632\n>https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=13091&type=time&from=USD&to=KSM&time=1658919600\n\n**Billing details can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXSELzfmNH1CP9JbI5Nq1wu8H83vnxJJ22TEjkF2Wgg/edit?usp=sharing).**",

      "title": "The Kusamarian 6 Month Maintenance Proposal",
      "content": "Original Discusion **[here](https://kusama.subsquare.io/post/3)**.\n\nDuring the **Q1** of 2022 **Chrawnna Corp.** delivered 5 weekday Dotsama-focused news videos every week and established a prototype of **WagMedia** — a Discord-based reward delivery system focused on connecting those who want to Share, Create, and Distribute the Story of Dotsama with sources of funding.\n\nIn **Q2**, The Kusamarian brand was created, gaining over 1000 followers on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheKusamarian), aiming to deliver even more frequent content with contributions from some of the strongest participants in WagMedia, growing the production team to 8. The team is fantastically agile, able to push out high quality and up to date content, interviews, or Special Series such as the 19 video **[Polkadot Decoded Reloaded](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtyd7v_I7PGlgPCXuIs55wwnbk594Kecw)** event. All content from the quarter can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNw3CEyOD-bjjYYaxVyG3Q/) and our **Proof of Work** including all research, rough work, references, SEO, and detailed [Spending Report](https://flying-wolf-8be.notion.site/Production-Funds-de4afb47625d48a9b4a5f0e74d074dff) is publicly available [here](https://flying-wolf-8be.notion.site/Q2-Content-Report-40b59b62222c46a6ac738359b8704b05).\n\nSeveral Treasuries were also plugged into** WagMedia **over the last 2 quarters including Polka Häus, Jam’s Cave, Lucky Friday, Astar/Shiden, RMRK, Crust, Moonbeam/Moonriver, Solarbeam, Scytale Ventures, Bifrost, and the Kusama Treasury via Bounty #12. More are on the way!\n\nIn **Q3 & 4 **we are requesting to spend the same rates for content production with a slightly reduced output adjusted to market sentiment. We're also reintroducing a Tutorial show for when attention returns to the ecosystem as well as mastering our catalogue of [60+ interviews](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtyd7v_I7PGkq7KUe3ep3lFLgKG97Z2AO) for distribution on popular podcast platforms. For each quarter we are requesting to spend aprox. 14% less than **Q2**\n\nWe are, however, for the first time additionally proposing to spend 14% of the requested **8002.8 KSM** on further developing **WagMedia** which endeavours to handle all content-focused tip and spending proposals previously put at the foot of the council. Goals over the next 2 quarters include, expanding our peer-reviewed translation and non-anglo community units, opening our Marketing department, and further decentralizing award distribution with the development of our bot, **The Concierge**. A proposal to top up **Bounty #12** to handle the Spend Proposal and Translation features (not part of the original curatorship) will follow [shortly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZA2kmLxJyFbF5Xwa7dxdrK6b6F8Z8UbUiMoU-lBoMRQ/edit#).\n\nFor now please dive into T[he Kusamarian 6 Month Maintenance Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_C34F07_LgY6DLgiXiLxbkMY_YH53if6esNhxXXYDG4/edit?usp=sharing) where you can meet our team, see what they propose to spend, and what they'll continue to build.\n\nThank you for supporting **Chrawnna Corp.** from a small tutorial youtube channel to what is today. We work every day to create top quality content in line with Token Holder interests with **The Kusamarian**. And with **WagMedia** we put the treasury to work by connecting it to eager content creators Decentralizing the Story of Dotsama within a productive and supportive community.\n\nYour comments, questions, and constructive suggestions are most welcome.",

      "content": "Encointer seeks for financing of its planned activities for the remaining time of its current common-good parachain lease, split into two proposals. The current proposal shall cover the funding until the end of September 2022. \n\nThe amount of the proposed treasury spend is **CHF 340’000 = USD 350'892 = KSM 6271.63**.\n*using [EMA50](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) and today's bid price for CHF*\n\nEncointer has onboarded as a common good parachain on Kusama on Jan 9th 2022. In May 2022, a first real community in Zurich was launched and has steadily grown to 130 users within 40 days doing almost 800 transactions in community currency. More communities are in preparation currently\n\nThe main focus of Encointer is currently:\n\n* to grow its Zurich community in order to prove the viability of its protocol and implementation as well as its economics with a pioneer community.\n* to onboard new communities around the world, especially in less developed regions in order to follow its vision.\n* to integrate with other parachains in the DotSama ecosystem for sybil-defense and one-person-one-vote democracy.\n\nSo far, Encointer was able to finance its past activities mostly thanks to the appreciation of the DOT and KSM tokens it received as web3 or DOT/KSM treasury grants. The association was also able to collect private donations and significant amounts of work were provided pro bono. Encointer’s financial strategy has been to keep around 70% of its capital in DOT and KSM which proved to be a good strategy so far, as our detailed numbers will show below. Due to recent market corrections, however, the runway of Encointer has dramatically decreased and Encointer can currently only maintain its current activity (development, operation, marketing, community building) for ~2 more months.  As a common-good, Encointer has no way to promise any return on investment, so the project relies on grants and donations.\n\nSee our [Proposal with full details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eTyZGCTCzo7ZGonVtAmJmc5QYYI0qYHab6z8w56B_F0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n",

      "content": "**This proposal was added through BrightTreasury. For more info & discussion, check [BrightTreasury](https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/179?networkId=kusama)**\n\n## About the project\n\nThe goal of the proposal is to fund development of further integration of BrightTreasury with Polkassembly. It would cover sharing the proposal Ideas to Polkassembly as a discussion as well as cross-posting of comments added via BrightTreasury & Polkassembly. This way any discussion about potential proposals could be held between users using their app of preference. As we focus on users who are less fluent in the Polkadot governance and community customs, it would allow them to gather feedback from more advanced users, who might be more inclined to use Polkassembly.\n\nProject Link : https://treasury.bright.dev\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\n## Milestones\n\n* Ideas Polkassembly integration\n* Comments Polkassembly integration\n* \"Likes\" in BrightTreasury + UX Improvements\n\n[See more...](https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/179/milestones?networkId=kusama)",

      "content": "This is a treasury proposal whose proposer address (FyLYnuNoMAVkz1VZMMGZFHDPghQQm1916fCon1CqNt2aXbX) is shown in on-chain info below.\n\n**Fearless Wallet Proposal**: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex7ew2P7w2nUQ_ZECoeGlsCMORGOR6YdwD5YP1JS__0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex7ew2P7w2nUQ_ZECoeGlsCMORGOR6YdwD5YP1JS__0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/9FMfrj9P/Proposal-background.jpg)\n\n**Context of the proposal**\n\n[Fearless Wallet ](https://fearlesswallet.io/)is:\n\n- A native **open source mobile app** for [iOS/](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/fearless-wallet/id1537251089?l=en)[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.soramitsu.fearless) \n- A native **open source library** for Substrate [iOS](https://github.com/soramitsu/fearless-utils-iOS)/[Android](https://github.com/soramitsu/fearless-utils-Android)\n- **Non-custodial** and **decentralized**, communicating directly with blockchain nodes\n- An app with **superior UX/UI, performance and security**\n- Used by **130 000+ people around the world** (based on AppStore and Google Play data)\n- **50 000+ active users (MAU)** based on recent App Markets data \n- **An important source of traffic, with 1 mln+** daily requests to Kusama and Polkadot, and other parachains (based on OnFinality nodes)\n- **Fully funded and supported by** [Kusama Treasury](https://kusama.network/), developed by [SORAMITSU](https://soramitsu.co.jp/)\n\n\n**This proposal focuses** on the implementation of:\n\n- **A UI/UX update of the main Wallet screens and flows**: The wallet’s current version could struggle to keep up with the breakneck pace of recent and upcoming initiatives and innovations of the ecosystem. The new wallet design will solve this set of issues and challenges, such as supporting multiple assets from hundreds of parachains, along with the possibility to exchange tokens between networks, work with NFTs and perform swaps within the wallet interface. \n- **NFT integration (Stage 1)**: Non-fungible token support is a feature that has  great community demand. In terms of the Stage #1 we’re going to implement some basic flows such as integrating a list of NFTs and Collections, along with NFT details and transfers. This implementation will be made for Statemine and Kusama (RMRK) NFT. In the future other NFT products of the Ecosystem can be supported through other proposals.\n- **Democracy feature integration (Stage 1)**: Democracy and governance systems are an important Dotsama advantage. The most valuable and demanded Democracy functions are Referenda flows and the ability to submit Proposals and vote for them. Stage #1 of integration will address these functions, and will also provide off-chain integration with Polkassembly and Subsquare platforms, to give users an opportunity to participate in an initiative’s preliminary discussions on the Polkassembly platform. All proposed integrations will be compatible with the upcoming Governance v2.0 update.\n- **XCM cross-chain teleports support**: Interoperability is one of the Dotsama ecosystem’s main benefits. The XCM message format allows assets to be moved between relay chains and parachains (and vice versa), as well as between various parachains. It provides the Ecosystem amazing flexibility, liquidity mobility, and high performance. As a part of this proposal we are going to implement XCM teleports between relay chains (Polkadot/Kusama) and parachains.\n- **Staking update on Polkadot/Kusama. Nomination pools.** Staking is a crucial functionality on blockchains that have PoS(DPoS/NPoS) consensus algorithms. In fact, community members are eager to make their contribution to system stability, safety, and decentralization by staking their assets. Nomination pools functionality is a cutting edge update of the staking function set. Therefore, our team has decided to add it to the scope of work, and is certain this innovative development will become a new trend in the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n- **dApp connector/signer**. The feature will work together with the Fearless Web extension application. The Web extension app has the role of a middleware service that provides some logic and necessary APIs to communicate between Mobile clients (Fearless Wallet Android/iOS Apps) and the Polkadot JS Extension protocol. It will allow users to: \n\n1.  Establish and maintain a connection with a dApp\n2.  Verify dApp generated transactions via the Mobile App without the need to export their user accounts to Web browsers\n\n\n**Submission details**\n\nAll details are available in the [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ex7ew2P7w2nUQ_ZECoeGlsCMORGOR6YdwD5YP1JS__0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n\n**The amount requested for the first submission is  $ 318 500.**\n\nThe amount will be recalculated according to the 7 day average rate, using the high and low of the week on Coingecko, at the day of on-chain action after the discussion process ends.\n\n\n**The 1st milestone  includes:**\n\n- New Wallet UI/UX \n- Nomination pools \n- Half of infrastructural costs\n\n\n**Previous grant completion report and final demo**\n\n- [Link to the report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NMYMsKBDFiRGWB5I05v8aNrM3pq6qKrXQcfhhs4guR4/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Demo #8, April 12th, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbBzEUkUWFo)\n\n",

An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\nAll archives can be accessed and queried via an web intuitive GraphiQL interface and are often used as developer friendly replacement of a block explorer.\n\nOver the last 3 months (March, April, May 2022) we've provided a free public data indexing service for ~35 Substrate blockchains (some archives have been dismissed, new ones have been added), so that everyone interested in the projects can publicly access indexed data on Substrate Events, Extrinsics, Storage Items and EVM logs.\n\nBetween 2022-03-20 (when tracking has started) and 2022-05-06 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n\n- Served a total of 1,213,705,478 (1.2 billion) queries\n- The highest daily total was 394,214,930 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our 7 day average at the end of this period is over 25 million responses each day.\n- Kusama and Polkadot chains represent a very important share of the demanded data, with 10 and 2.8 million queries per week, respectively\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTM5hIviY0x_1YVeOD0QEw8uPvPHmFKNcAQrEwCQGSF7JuYAZuUCYo9dXrIfRnCQqVVH5tIMzCb1jjC/pubchart?oid=1449674255&format=image)\n\nThis proposal includes the combined costs for running Archives for Kusama and its Parachains, which amounts to a total of  USD $9,771.07 - [raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RkNQ6-10u_nmmNy2Nkwi-i9EDXv6VwwLJw4DdJVx1pQ/).\n\n[Full text of the proposal can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRtyrXYpKdTbv0TcKuqSO_LR2OU4KiqWjUsHaRftNtu7KtpGP1_Q6gXbGzZupPRQhfnD2z5UuhCIOmv/pub)\n\nThank you for your consideration, Subsquid.io\n\n[Website](https://subsquid.io/) [Twitter](https://twitter.com/subsquid) [Email](mailto:social@subsquid.io) [Github](https://github.com/subsquid/)",

I come from a community where blockchain is just being adopted, so having Polkadot Decoded 2022 viewed by some of my community members it will help me more publicize Polkadot and Kusama, and this is one of the many reasons I ask to be funded so that I can host this view party on the 29th and 30th of June.\n\nI am an ambassodor representing Polkadot and Kusama in Kigali City and I have contributed in different ways, by hosting in person meetups and building the Polkadot and Kusama community, I have been able to speak at different Blockchain events evangelizing the Dotsama ecosystems, I have been engaged in twitter posts concerning Dotsama Ecosystem.\n\nThe event will take place in the capital of Rwanda, Kigali City, and the audience target is Dotsama lovers, Web3 enthusiasts, developers, and entrepreneurs. The viewing party will go for two days of live streaming.

      "content": "> Proponent:  ecardo5o /  KSM Account: EkQWFRUHmSt8qCwmgYv8TNSaFu1Xo5DaDAHBZbZZFxXMwDr\nContact: Eduardo Cardoso [ecardoso@pointille.com.br ] / Discord: _ecardo5o#3065\nDate: 29 June 2022\nRequested KSM:  KSM:841,96  USD $46,813.00 EMA7 \n\nHolding an edition of Polkadot Decoded in Buenos Aires this year puts Latin America definitely on the roadmap of our ecosystem.\n\nBut it also leaves a gap in our continent, which basically splits into two languages:\n\n- Portuguese, spoken only in Brazil\n- And Spanish, predominant in other countries\n\nBecause of this and also other factors (which are well detailed in the link below), we strongly believe that it is necessary to hold an event at this moment that helps to reverberate Polkadot Decoded in Brazil as well.\n\nAnalyzing this case over the last two weeks, we came to the conclusion that this event would not fit the standard of a Viewing Party.\n\nAlthough we have great interest in cryptocurrencies in the country, we realized that the content presented in Polkadot Decoded is too advanced for our local audience and that it would be better to think about it in another way, taking advantage of this moment in which Polkadot Decoded is being carried out and reverberated by the All the world.\n\nThe solution would be to think of an event that better connects our small community with decision makers in the traditional financial market (since the country is very open to legislation favorable to cryptos, with large financial institutions announcing the start of their operations in the sector), journalists and opinion makers. All these audiences are currently interested in the subject but are totally unaware of the DOTSAMA ecosystem and above all its possibilities and fundamentals.\n\nThe result of this analysis is a project that does not fit well in a Viewing Party. But that we believe is the ideal for this moment. In these two weeks we talked to a lot of people and ended up assembling a highly qualified team for this mission. And we're very motivated to do something that fills that gap above with a for-all event that combines:\n\n- Informational and Educational Content.\n- Debate\n- Participation of Our Local Ambassadors.\n- Relationship building with the agents mentioned above (market decision makers, journalists and opinion makers).\n- Reverberation in networks.\n- Documentation (through the registration and subsequent publication of these lectures and debate).\n\nWe also want with this event:\n\n- Communicate what Polkadot Decoded is.\n- Talk about what people will be able to access about this 2022 edition.\n- Make a Happy Hour that is in tune with the festive spirit of our culture.\n- Position DOTSAMA as a protagonist in the development of WEB3, providing a technological environment focused on innovation.\n\nThe way we want to do this will really be outside the parameters of a traditional corporate event and we hope that everyone here will be able to read our Proposal, appreciate our ideas and contribute their suggestions. Despite the different format, our total cost of realization is compatible with other events presented.\n\nWe do not want and should not leave Brazil with this gap.\n\nMore Details: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_MKIhzkUAUT9uKkOuFiiMKooARIT5ZAnJXMyMOJPZc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D_MKIhzkUAUT9uKkOuFiiMKooARIT5ZAnJXMyMOJPZc/edit?usp=sharing)\n     \n",

She contributes to Polkadot and Kusama Ecosystems in the areas of writing blogs, tweet threads, event organizing, attending and speaking at blockchain events to spread more awareness about Dotsama ecosystems, engaging in tweets discussion about projects within Dotsama Ecosystems as well as responding to questions which she has knowledge of in the official Polkadot discord server(Mims4life#4745). I have decided to use the upcoming Polkadot Decoded Event 2022 as a medium to bond with Dotsama lovers here and also spread more information about the latest happenings since the launch of parachains and other opportunities available to everyone within the ecosystem. The event will take place at the capital city of Nigeria-Abuja. Although, other Dotsama lovers, blockchain enthusiasts, Web2 and Web 3 developers, engineers, start up founders and entrepreneurs who reside outside Abuja can attend the live streaming party. However, you should bear it in mind that we would not cover your transportation and accommodation expenses. This viewing party include two days of live streaming the event in a large venue located in an ambience environment which can accommodate up to 170 people. There will be refreshments and fun activities during break periods.

We took into account this difference to make sure we get the amount of USD we need to execute the event. See the breakdown in the payment conditions document\n\n**Short description: **The event for Polkadot Decoded in Mexico is facing some challenges. It was announced that Mexico would host an official event for Decoded, today there are more than 170 people registered to assist in the event, and people are starting to ask why Mexico does not appear on the official Decoded Site (Examples in the document). The Mexican community AT LEAST deserves a Polkadot Level closing party on June 30. This is a proposal to maintain Polkadot’s reputation in Mexico, and execute a 500 people party in one of the coolest venues in the city, with a cost per attendee of $90 USD, one of the most efficient costs compared to other similar proposals like Korea’s kickoff party.\n\nHere you can read the whole proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_14ItHphMQnTyBShzMgQxlQ8QsuEaIpYZltoYingnsg/edit#",

Also part of this equation is the development of human bonds and a social and cultural awareness of the impacts that WEB3 will have on all of us. In order to pierce this bubble that makes these topics and discussions so far from the reality of most people, the DOTSAMA Adventures project was created. \n\nThrough its actions, meetings and seminars (all held so far only in Latin America) DOTSAMA Adventures has been bringing the academic community, investors, entrepreneurs, students and even people who have heard about cryptos but in fact still don't know what it is about.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/NZ5V1Jh/Flyer-Among-the-Stars.png)\n\nDOTSAMA Adventures is a collaborative initiative between members of the ecosystem passionate about decentralised technologies, the same that made the caravan that toured Chile - Among the Stars, inspired by the first activation movements promoted in Latin America, which were the Lima Latam Day.  The final event of this tour was broadcasted on the Polkadot en Español channel (YouTube): https://youtu.be/0qW2z_zpNF0\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mbWxQ8p/Fotos-Among-the-Stars.png)\n\nAll this continuous work in the transmission of knowledge, coexistence and integration has had a great impact on our ecosystem in Latin America, bringing new stakeholders and promoting strategic links and joint action in several countries, something that had not happened until then. Today, this  initiatives involve Ambassadors in Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Peru and Colombia and the objective now is to strengthen these ties in the European Continent as well.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/txVPwdM/Barcelona.png)\n\nFor this, the Group created the Spain Activation project, which will consist of the first official and face-to-face meetings of these members of the DOTSAMA community in Latin America with their peers in Europe, in addition to a program that will also involve different sectors of Spanish society - from technology, to sports professionals, through art, science, education and gastronomy.\n\nOur objective in all these actions will be one: to democratize knowledge about the benefits of a Web3, positioning the DOTSAMA ecosystem (including its Parachains) as the main protagonists in this journey.\n\n**DOTSAMA Adventures -  Spain Activation Proposal**:[ Proposal Spain Deploy Chaos](https://docs.google.com/document/d/165atRa67b4ioXmIShDMYAcXAyQKaGDATG9QYlG9tOB0/edit)\n\n**Dotsama Adventures- Brief: Brief Deploy Chaos Spain** -[ DOTSAMA ADVENTURE.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-uqClTQNhbCIqtsQDnN9UeDV6vYLiXCA/view?usp=sharing)\n\n",

This submission proposes a recurring payment (quarterly) to cover maintenance, operations and human resource costs for Polkassembly, including general maintenance, runtime upgrades changes and could/infrastructure cost. Since Polkassembly supports both Kusama and Polkadot Networks, this maintenance proposal will alternate networks for submission every three months. This submission covers costs for April, May and June of 2022. We are requesting the Kusama treasury to provide funds this time. We are using a 7 days EMA due to sharp price fall of KSM.\n\nThe full proposal is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r1Z71GQ8HyovvUAcdlId3_H8hMqRxdS4rz6z3u30evQ/edit?usp=sharing)",

We find that providing a decentralized infrastructure for the community is important and key to their recovery in a degraded situation. Having multiple mirror copies of snapshots will assist the community to increase their ability to handle the recovery time.\n\nWe are expecting to provide snapshot services in Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend. Nevertheless, we feel that Westend, while being a test-net, it plays a role in many alpha developments of various applications.\n\nWe want to help the community by providing additional instructions for new validators in several languages (English, French, Chinese, Spanish). They will be posted on various social medias. In the meanwhile, we are also looking to decentralize the snapshots service to more service providers out there than the existing ones that we know.\n\nWe welcome feedback from the community and the official team,\n\nA copy of the detailed proposal can be found [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_NweuAvFyPyb2nWHn4ZaoPf5JPZn5XmteQg2WFjbcU/edit#heading=h.9lx3uiu2vy1q)\n\nSincerely,\n\n1KVnode Team",

      "content": "The goal of the proposal is to fund the Bright Treasury app maintenance costs. We have automated tests and deployment of infrastructure templates with continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD). The infrastructure as code approach lets us have an easy run and update of the environment.\n\nProject Link : https://treasury.bright.dev Link to any documentation already published: https://github.com/bright/bright-tresury\n\nBrightTreasury is a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that allows performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It allows a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions.\n\nOur focus is on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.\n\nBright Inventions is a team of 70 developers, project managers, UX/UI designers and operations specialists - experts in mobile and web applications, systems integration, IOT devices and Blockchain platforms.\n\nWe believe that building a software product is about people working together in a collective way. By offering complex support – mobile and web development as well as IT consultancy we try to eliminate roadblocks towards engaging clients as partners at every step of the process.\n\nWe support startups, digital agencies as well as medium to big businesses. We cooperate with startups, accelerators and incubators. Whatever the client profile is, we always aim to establish a satisfying partnership for both sides. Since 2012 we have built software for more than 40 businesses worldwide.\n\nThe BrightTreasury team currently consists of:\n\nAgnieszka Olszewska - Technical Lead, blockchain specialist. She is a senior backend developer with a main interest in data modeling. She started her software development career 10 years ago and from then she began discovering a lot of new technologies. Among them there are JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Postgres, Node.js, NestJS. Most recently she’s been engaged in developing blockchain based solutions with Substrate.\n\nAlisa Kashytska - UI/UX design She is a UI/UX designer with a passion for digging deep into the product domain and understanding the user's perspective. She has worked on the design for multiple web/mobile solutions and lately has been responsible for UI redesign of Parity Building Blocks Android and web apps.\n\nŁukasz Kuderewski - fullstack developer He is an optimist, always willing to learn new things. Mechatronics engineer who fell in love with programming. He has always been interested in a holistic approach to programming problems, which is why after working as a frontend, he is now fulfilled as a fullstack.\n\nRobert Koprowski - fullstack developer, blockchain specialist He is an experienced and ambitious blockchain enthusiast. Graduated from the University of Edinburgh, he lived in various locations around the world to settle now in Gdańsk. Originally a Backend Developer who decided to extend his skills and become Fullstack Developer, always trying to learn something new.\n\nKatarzyna Łukasiewicz - Project Manager She has been working with agile methods for over 10 years, both as a researcher and a practitioner. She believes in teamwork and a power of user centered mindset. With experience in leading international projects, she knows how to support and encourage timely and high quality deliveries.\n\nBased on our 01-03.2022 Maintenance proposal (https://treasury.bright.dev/proposals/85/info?networkId=polkadot) we prepared a prediction of costs for the upcoming 3 months.\n\n3 month Maintenance cost projection for April, May, June 2022:\n\n- AWS app hosting prediction for 3 months\t2300 $\n- Self-hosted TeamCity CI server\t                1000 $\n- Infrastructure maintenance activities labour\t5000 $\n- Code maintenance activities labour\t        7000 $\n- Marketing & educational activities labour\t1200 $\n\n                                                     TOTAL\t16,500 $\n\nInfrastructure maintenance activities include:\n\n- AWS logs checkup - scanning the logs and statistics checkup, performed every morning in the work days\n- Incident and problem management - taking action whenever an unwanted event occurs in the infrastructure\n- Infrastructure updates - checking and updating any infrastructure setup when a new version appears\n\nCode maintenance activities include:\n\n- Critical bug fixes (Github issue tracker) - analyzing and performing the required actions whenever a critical issue is raised in the BrightTreasury GitHub issue tracker. Action should be taken within 24hrs from raising the issue.\n- PolkadotJS and stage/testing/production Substrate versions updates - updating the app to work with the newest PolkadotJS versions and automatic testing of the versions in CI\n- Libraries and tools updates - performing any necessary updates of the libraries and tools used with the app\n\nMarketing & educational activities include:\n\n- Publishing 3 blog posts promoting Polkadot and Kusama Treasury mechanisms, BrightTreasury and Web 3.0. Articles are planned to be distributed through various platforms e.g. https://brightinventions.pl/blog https://hackernoon.com/ https://dev.to/ https://medium.com/\n- YouTube tutorial presenting basic BrightTreasury features.\n- Series of Twitter posts regarding BrightTreasury published via https://twitter.com/brightdevs\n\nPayment Conditions:\n\nTotal allocation to be paid in advance for quarterly periods, based on estimations.\nAny fluctuations of the period before will be added in the next one, along with proof of cost, in order to be covered.\nThe team will provide maintenance reports before on-chain submission of proposals to treasuries to cover the above mentioned costs.\nMaintenance costs will be covered by both Kusama and Polkadot treasuries: we aim to submit quarterly proposals alternating between both treasuries, as both networks are integrated to the application.\nToken rate to be calculated based on 30day average tool by Subcan on Polkadot and Kusama.",

      "content": "Proponent: OpenSquare(ESgz7GLVW7BL5DhRgpVnxSXVwaKt4ytWcrf52TY1GQD1cEb)  \nDate: 05/03/2022  \nRequested Allocation: 190.63 KSM (EMA30 price of KSM on subscan is 157.893) \n\n---\n\nProduct link: [https://voting.opensquare.io](https://voting.opensquare.io)\n\nThis product is originally funded by w3f grant and you can find the proposal [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/OpenSquare-offchain-voting.md) and the delivery PR [here](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/297). We have done a lot of work to improve it, got some achievements and are requesting fund to support the last 4 monthes work after the grant delivery.\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn a word, you can see OpenSquare off-chain voting as [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) implementation in the polkadot ecosystem. Users can create proposal with specified block heights and vote off chain with the user balance as the weight. \n\nNow the assets it supports including:\n- substrate based chain native tokens\n- Statemine assets and other assets pallet token on other para-chains\n- ORML assets\n- ERC20 asset on moonriver and moonbeam\n\nMultiple assets supporting make it possible that voting with one asset from different chains. Currently there are no proposals in kusama space, but we can see we support voting with $KSM from Kusama, Statemine, Karura, Bifrost and Moonriver.\n\n## Use cases\n\n### For substrate chains\nMost substrate based chains have onchain governance, but off-chain voting still makes sense with following reasons:\n- Voting from multiple chains. It increases the voters' scope.\n- Gas free. \n- More flexible strategies for voting result. Currently we support `balance-of`, `qudratic-balance-of` and `biased-voting` to calculate the voting result.\n\nAll in all though we have the onchain governance, off-chain voting provides a different way to help community engage more in the governance. We can use it for:\n- Discussions with polls. Onchain proposals are usually formal ones which make users not so easy to express their opinions. But we can even raise some controversial topics with off-chain voting.\n- It can be used as a 'temperature checking' tool before the final onchain proposal.\n\n### For non chain assets\n\nThere are assets in different forms in the dotsama ecosystem. An asset may exists as a Statemine asset, a ORML token, or even a ERC20 token. This off-chain voting tool can be used as their formal governance tool with which nearly all forms of tokens can be used to vote a proposal.\n\n### Examples\n\nFortunately we've got several users.\n- [RMRK](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/rmrk-curation) uses it for the NFT collection curation proposals.\n- [Kintsugi](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/kintsugi) uses it to pre-vote before the onchain proposal.\n- [Karura](https://voting.opensquare.io/space/karura) created a proposal to collect community opinions for 'kUSD Upgrade to aUSD'.\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe've got more users.\n![](https://i.imgur.com/JDYY1Xu.png)\n\n## Work and budget\n\nOur work include:\n- Support statemine assets\n- Support multiple chain voting for one asset\n- Support ERC20 token voting\n- Components polish.\n\nPlease check the [code diff](https://github.com/opensquare-network/collaboration/compare/release-1.2.0...release-1.5.0). We will request about 15 FTE days each month to cover the common structure work. This request doesn't include our customization for the ecosystem projects, and we won't request it from dotsama treasury.\n\n```javascript=\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Item                  | monthes              | Cost    |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Monthly development   | 4(12.2021 - 03.2022) | $30,000 |\n| 15 FET day/month      |                      |         |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Server(Hetzner cpx41) | 4                    | $99     |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n| Total                 |                      | $30,099 |\n+-----------------------+----------------------+---------+\n```\n\nPayment conditions:\n\n1.

      "content": "**Proponent:** ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP\n\n**Date:** 27th April 2022\n\n**Requested KSM:** 276.29 KSM\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\n**Raw Data:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SeLZ-N0G55G4JgjncfS-8_kM3L6fWUl5X0SaQMWZ--4/edit?usp=sharing\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (January, February, March 2022) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n- Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n- Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n- Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we’ve made GitHub issues based on behaviour we’ve observed)\n\n## Service Details\n\nThis last quarter has been huge for Kusama and OnFinality, the demand for our services continues to be another  unprecedented period. January had a larger activity than the rest of the quarter which also had our highest daily response count (for Q1). [Raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nPk1_IPvRj4_8Xpn7Wa2KNjrqXW7kRacP9X0nsCo6fQ/edit#gid=1598230413).\n\nThis quarter was all about service stabilisation as part of the promise we made to this ecosystem to provide enterprise grade services to the community. Our services all exceeded our 99.9% target, with 99.99% uptime for Polkadot over the last 90 days. This is an important measure as we surpassed our largest ever day, with over a billion API responses processed by our service in a single 24 hour period in late January.\n\nBetween 2022-01-01 and 2022-03-31 our Kusama API service has:\n\n- Served a total of 4,975,878,346 (4.9 billion) responses\n- Accumulated over 34 TB of data egress\n- The highest daily total was 85,238,268 responses in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 49 million responses each day.\n- Statemine had over 654 million API responses in the period\n- All time totals for Kusama is 1,186,285,385 (1 Trillion) since November, 2020\n- At the end of this period the 90 day uptime on Kusama and Statemine was 99.99% and 99.97% respectively\n\n[The full proposal is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15ezC2j2KbSatjrDIND67H5w8cZntc0Grgfj2Z3267ko/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "Hi! I'm Cervera and I've been producing educational tutorial videos about Polkadot and Kusama since April 19, 2021, just a year ago! Currently, on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsP0zGvvzB4RGyDYHkDdmUA) you can find two playlists, one for [Polkadot](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAPR14k1-zSpznR-HSNYHaqa) and one for [Kusama](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbGd7ZIYqZAP3PysUxiwYGW7aHsC60TnN). Both have 19 videos. Cumulatively, this equates to 42,040 views, 1,085 comments and more than 8,000 watch hours.\n\nThe following proposal seeks funding for the production and continued development of the Kusama playlist. Production of video tutorials in Spanish that accompany the user in carrying out functions on the network step by step. These videos explain everything you need to be aware of in a clear and detailed way and show that all the information comes from truthful sources. These educational video tutorials will be created weekly from May 2nd to October 10th.\n\nMy goal is to create a complete playlist on the canary network Kusama, where all its functionalities are explained in a simple and clear way so that any Spanish-speaking user feels welcome when starting out in the ecosystem, feels comfortable when carrying out actions and can use the network safely.\n\nCheck the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wzXd7k55l-nX7cXIdwDnA1WwMIKIVCXYMLprlqMraeY/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nOriginal post discussions can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1471).\n\nFurther community feedback may be found on this [tweet](https://twitter.com/cryptonitas_/status/1516360436194717696?s=20&t=kFwOjU9JANdM_ELmYHg2XA).\n\nI encourage you to leave your comment below.",

Generally the maintaining work includes the monitoring of servers, bug fixes, UI/UX tweaks, small features enhacement, some manual work to add necessary infos, etc. We're requesting fund from kusama treasury to cover the work cost. To reduce the review work we align the requests for dotreasury and statescan, and propose them in one proposal. \n\nStatescan is now an explorer implementation for Kusama/Polkadot asset parachains. Users can check the fungible and non-fungible assets on it. We have implemented it for Statemine/Statemint/Westmint.\n\nDotreasury aims to introduce retrospect mechanism for Kusama/Polkadot treasury, while you can see it as a treasury explorer. Check [here](https://www.dotreasury.com/dot/projects/dotreasury) for this project history and [post #352](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352) for the original discussions.\n\n\n## Servers\n\n### For statescan\n\nWe are using 3 Hetzner vps + a 400G volume for production hosting and 2 contabo vps for development.\n\nHetzenr vps for deployment:\n- vps1: CPX31(4 vcpu + 8G ram + 160G) = €12.4/mo\n- Vps2: CPX41(8 vcpu + 16G ram + 240G) = €22.9/mo\n- vps3: CPX41(8 vcpu + 16G ram + 240G) = €22.9/mo\n- volume 400GB = €16.0/mo\n\nContabo vps for development:\n- vps1: 4v + 8G ram + 200G = $6.99\n- vps2: 4v + 8G ram + 200G = $6.99\n\nExpsense:\n\n```javascript=\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Item           | months | Cost    |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzner vps1   | 3      | €37.20  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr vps2   | 3      | €68.70  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzner vps3   | 3      | €68.70  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr volume | 3      | €48.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Contabo vps1   | 3      | $20.97  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Contabo vps2   | 3      | $20.97  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total          | €222.6 + $41.94  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total in $     | $284.22          |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n```    \n### For dotreasury:\n\nWe are using 2 Hetzner vps + 2 external volumes for the production hosting and 1 contabo vps for development.\n\nHetzner vps for deployment:\n\n- vps1 for polkadot: vps1: CPX31(4 vcpu + 8G ram + 160G) = €12.4/mo\n- vps2 for kusama: vps1: CPX31(4 vcpu + 8G ram + 160G) = €12.4/mo\n- volume1 for polkadot: 400GB = €16.0/mo\n- volume2 for kusama: 800GB = €32.0/mo\n\nContabo vps for development:\n- vps1: 4v + 8G ram + 200G = $6.99\n\nExpsense:\n\n```javascript=\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Item           | months | Cost    |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzner vps1   | 5      | €62.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr vps2   | 5      | €62.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr volume1| 5      | €80.00  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Hetzenr volume1| 5      | €160.00 |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Contabo vps1   | 5      | $34.95  |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total          | €364 + $34.95    |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n| Total in $     | $431.13          |\n+----------------+--------+---------+\n```\n\n## Continuous development & daily maintenace\n\n### For statescan\n\n- Bug fixes including asset analysis, dot price tracker and the price chart.\n- Code refactor including removing useless packages, upgrading dependencies.\n- Improve the IPFS parsing scripts so we can parse some NFT images on westmint.\n- Collecting and updating some fungible assets info.\n- Server deployments and handling issues like scaning stopped by node connection problems.\n\nWe will request 4 FTE work cost each month for the work.

      "content": "Dear Kusama community\n\nWe would like to submit a treasury proposal for the maintenance of polkachu.com for Q1 2022. This quarter, we released two important new product: [Node Snapshots](https://polkachu.com/snapshots) and [Payout Guards](https://polkachu.com/payout_guard). And we continue to maintain a few projects, including a popular dashboard for the Thousand Validators Program, a validator/nominator search portal called Scout and many other smaller features.\n\nBefore we submit the proposal on-chain, we initiated a polkassembly discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1450). \n\nThe detailed proposal can be found [here](https://github.com/PolkachuIntern/treasury_proposals/blob/main/polkachu_2022q1_maintenance.md). \n\nBetween the initial polkassembly post and today, we made two changes in the detailed proposal:\n\n1. Added $173 snapshot server cost that we initially left out. [Github Commit](https://github.com/PolkachuIntern/treasury_proposals/commit/2ceda89f5413ca5366ba5efe569d642f9334eb02)\n2. Updated the Subscan EMA30 number on the day of proposal submission. [Github Commit](https://github.com/PolkachuIntern/treasury_proposals/commit/1c55b9a0b68cad57c4b841bded563c930771b52b)\n\nWhile our work contributes to both Polkadot and Kusama communities, we believe that the amount is reasonable enough to just ask from the Kusama Treasury. \n\nThank you for your consideration!\n\nPolkachu",

      "content": "This is a follow-up proposal on what we [submitted in December](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1204), to further fund the development of the RPC services and to cover the maintenance costs of it.\n\nThis new proposal includes two Milestones.\n\n**Milestone 1:** Continue to run the Kusama and Statemine RPC services on dedicated hardware, to increase the performance of the services.\n\n**Milestone 2:** Continue to develop, support, and push open source code to improve the RPC Performance toolkit. (This toolkit can be used for all Substrate based nodes.) For this next Quarter we aim to implement **Improved Workload Modeling** and **Test Plans**.\n### Report\n\nOur Kusama RPC node served on average **5,570,105** requests per day during the last quarter.\n\nIn our last Kusama Treasury Proposal we received a grant to troubleshoot and analyze the performance issues of the RPC nodes.\n\nWe have [published a report](https://github.com/dwellir-public/rpc-perf/blob/main/report.md) about our findings and developed an [RPC performance toolkit](https://github.com/dwellir-public/rpc-perf/) for node operators.\n\nThanks to the work we have done with the performance toolkit our RPC service capacity and stability has now increased.\n\n- Our full proposal can be [read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15JfkUuuOSHiL4sfyl-M7gp9xoAIMLObzYYMOvSm3zWg/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Governance Rewarder Proposal - Milestone 2, 3 + General",
      "content": "Dear Council,\nThe first item of the RMRK2 Collection has already been sent out. \n\nFirst time voters now receive a [shelf](https://singular.app/collectibles/11922926-3208723ec6f65df810-SHELF-VS-203) and an [item](https://singular.app/collectibles/11922939-3208723ec6f65df810-ITEM-181-203). Each time they vote on a Referendum an additional item gets added to their shelf which they can equip. The first item has been sent out to voters of Referendum 181. This proposal is to cover Milestone 2, 3 + General. My aim now is to make the collection economically viable on its own as to not rely on Treasury spending in the future. This is to be achieved through the creator royalties made possible in RMRK2.0.0\n\nThe full [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfgM_z3bDznbDa5ee2HBLRoqW10BShwJnD6hmSjODCs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginally I planned to do a pixel collection due to the difficulties I had finding artists. Now that I have a good working relationship with several, it became possible to create a more artsy collection. I adopted some of the ideas brought forward by Bruno in the [original community post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1358) and thus the current collection was born. While it is not what I promised to build in the original proposal, I trust that the community will agree this to be a more fun and interactive collection. Since I now also incur artist fees for the rmrk2 collection, I hope that everyone sees this change as overdelivering rather than underdelivering.\n\nIt has been fun to build this project and I am thrilled to have gotten so much great feedback already. I look forward to continuously improving the collection and driving governance participation further!!!\n\n[A deep dive into the past, the present and the future of the Referendum Voting Rewards Project.](https://app.subsocial.network/6214/referendum-voting-rewards-the-past-the-present-the-future-32141)\n\n",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nAnyone that has found their way over to the democracy tab, knows that currently Kusama still has a dramatic **lack of** community **involvement** in governance. We frequently have appalling voting turnout rates of **less than 1%** or even less than 0.1% on our referenda! This is **not healthy** for the network and in order to become truly **democratic** and **decentralised**, we **NEED** to encourage voting from all members!\n\nWith my latest project I decided to tackle this issue specifically! I wrote a program that **automatically rewards** all **voters** with an **NFT** at the end of a referendum. Some of you will have already noticed those NFTs appear in your wallets for the last few referenda. Today I would like to bring forward my spending proposal for the project for community discussion. I would love to get your feedback!\n\nMore info on the [project](https://app.subsocial.network/6214/incentivising-referendum-votes-31299).\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TfgM_z3bDznbDa5ee2HBLRoqW10BShwJnD6hmSjODCs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe link to the [community discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1358)",

      "content": "this proposal covers milestone 1 of the entire project. \n\nBuilding the Kusamaverse, a real-time and persistent 3D home for the Kusama ecosystem. Enabling a new way for users to navigate, connect and contribute to and benefit from the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n- Where the Kusama community can gather, engage into on-chain and off-chain activities, tailored to collective value creation, and can build their own social network economy. \n\n- Where activities like staking, parachain auctions, as well as gatherings, hackathons are directly accessible as a shared experience in the metaverse. \n\nKusama is an experimental development environment for teams who want to move fast and innovate, or prepare for deployment on Polkadot. \n\nThere are limitations to what the Kusama community with its current UX can do. The focus of the current applications, mainly polkadot.js, are on on-chain activities, for technically sound individuals using a complex, very detailed, dashboard. In general, there is lots and lots of information to absorb, and most of the time people don’t even know why certain information is there as it has no context to them. \n\nIt is not a social process where you can meet and learn from each other users, nor is the process inviting to non-technical participants. Staking and other on- and off-chain activities could and should be an attractive and fulfilling experience for a wide(r) audience. \n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/9/3/9/7/93979a20e1ef2dc0ab54c46e5c08355becb205a9/Kusamaverse-1920x1842.webp)\n*Artist impression of what the Kusamaverse **could** look like*\n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/0/e/0/1/0e0164c4bbe30a1f92d492c2452fc3baf30f7f3f/Schermafbeelding_2022-02-02_om_09.58.03-1534x1474.webp)\n\nThe Kusamaverse will facilitate and boost both off-chain activities (like meetups, incubation of initiatives, policy making) and on-chain activities (like staking, crowd-loans, voting). \n\n**About the team**\n\nSince 2013, Odyssey has been active in the, as we call it in 2022, Web3-space. We have been involved and supporting Polkadot and Kusama right from the start in 2016, by giving it a platform at our conferences and enabling over 350 teams to build during our hackathons, with Polkadot experts from Parity on-site giving workshops and assisting builders.\n\n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/a/c/e/2/ace203bb177625b8424742f189f1922bce4636dd/28033836905_cbe97437b9_o-1920x1280.webp)\n\nWe organised Europe's biggest blockchain hackathon and multi-stakeholder incubator, with over 100 partners like the European Commission, Dell, KLM, VMware, IUCN, Vattenfall, Engie and several Dutch Ministries. \n\n![](https://odyssey.org/_Resources/Persistent/4/c/9/6/4c96f84911460c15b563f706d0c4ce092222c46a/46713147705_16fe5b24e8_o-1920x1061.webp)\n\nWhen COVID hit, we developed the first version of the Momentum software, as a 3D online mass collaboration arena, to host our annual hackathon with 2500 participants. The prototype of this 3d world premiered at the Odyssey Momentum Hackathon, Nov 2020, with 1600 participants collaborating on 21 hackathon challenges, logged in simultaneously, in one massive [multiplayer 3d environment](https://youtu.be/mwpj70Gcatg). \n\n20 months after this prototype, Odyssey.org now is a digital native foundation established in The Netherlands, with a live product used by several thousand users in multiple 3d worlds that are in production. Anyone can freely experiment and start their initiative in our alpha world: momentum.odyssey.org.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nThe current proposal for on-chain submission is for milestone 1. Milestone 2-4 we included to give a look into our future thinking and ideas, to be adapted upon after learnings from milestone 1.\n\nPlease find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18DtpAsYRt7kZYY1XJZrBcbruhkWbKZzwJFKnrtTCG0w/edit?usp=sharing), looking forward to questions and feedback! \n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Extrinsics.io is an extrinsics building platform that provides an improved user interface and experience for users in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. It has a fresh new take on building and signing extrinsics that enables both regular users and power users to better understand and utilise the extrinsic builder. It will also provide users of the currently available wallets with tools that help make calls to the network that are not currently available in any of those wallets.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/AhQwWGr.png)\n\nOur goal with extrinsics.io is to build a platform that makes it easier for new users to understand and utilise the extrinsic builder with more comfort and ease while also making sure that power users can quickly get to what they are looking for when they have to build an extrinsic. Here are some key points that highlight those changes:\n\n- Unified screen for encoding and decoding extrinsics\n\n- Intuitive Decoder View\n\n- An editable decoder UI\n\n- A better interface for the encoder\n\nYou can take a look at the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ty52DlBTx9Lf14vzYnIaIBoRC2kaRCU3EG9B_KRZd3E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe platform would also support signing of extrinsics functions with both Kusama and Polkadot. We would start with supporting both Kusama and Polkadot networks with the option of extending it to other networks at a later stage.\n\nThe proposal consists of just one milestone and an estimated 3 months to complete. After Milestone 0 is completed we plan to make a report that will be shared on Polkassembly and Kusama Direction.\n\n\nWe would love to hear your feedback and get your thoughts around the project. Feel free to leave a comment below, or reach out via email, anytime.\n\n- This submission covers the expenses for the entire proposal.\n- Kusama rate at $206.654 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n\n[Link to the recent discussion on Polkassembly](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1328)",

We scaled up the compute component of our infrastructure to maintain service levels as a result. Additionally we are closely watching the work that Dwellir is doing in the ecosystem to propose improvements to the RPC nodes.\n\nAdditionally, our experience shows significant performance improvements in terms of response times when the CPU usage is less than 50%. We observed a noticeable drop of service quality (in terms of response times) when the node is under load.\n\nThis proposal includes combined running costs for our infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine. The total combined running cost is USD $45,949.51\n\n[The full writeup is here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mzROC1pcn6h6awsxdQ0LB1nOLWzUMNZjK8L2kL_3p_A/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "SNI’s Winter 2022 Hackathon Prizes",
      "content": "\n# Overview\n\nSNI&#39;s Winter 2022 Hackathon is a 3-day online event + 1-day showcase. Sovereign Nature Initiative (SNI) is a non-profit foundation that is building on Kusama and has brought together multiple partners and engineers from the **Kusama ecosystem** including [Kodadot](https://nft.kodadot.xyz/), [Unique Network](https://unique.network/), [Kilt Protocol](https://kilt.io/), and [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), for **two contests** taking place in two separate areas of SNI&#39;s focus. One for tech innovation in the form of a hackathon, and the other as a creative writing competition with NFT generation. Both competitions&#39; results will be showcased in a special &quot;Experimental Zone&quot; in-person event planned for May 21-22 at [De Ceuvel](https://deceuvel.nl/en/) Amsterdam. The pledges we are seeking from the Council will provide prizes to the winners of both contests.\n\n**Venue** : Odyssey Momentum online Hackathon, and De Ceuvel, Korte Papaverweg, Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\n**Time** : February 4th-6th 2022 and May 21st-22nd 2022\n\n**Beneficiary address:**\nG2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\n**Submitter address:**\n G2bC9gtyHBkxmg65nZiZ7pbrV7PMLNXUTwr6dqMUk8KDxXG\n\n# **Community Spend &amp; Deliverables**\n\nThe pledges we are seeking from the Council will provide prizes to enhance the reach and impact of these programs – 15,000.00 USD in prizes for the winners of the contests, which will encourage them to continue building their DApps to full fruition, in a final collaborative effort between SNI and both the contest winners.\n\n### Amount to spend from the community pool\n\n15,000.00 USD in KSM equivalent\n\n### Timeline\n\n By Jan 27th 2022\n\n### How will funds be spent\n\nAll the funds will be given as the prizes to the winners of the contests. As follows:\n```\n+------------------------------------------+---------------+\n|            Contest Breakdown             |    Amount     |\n+------------------------------------------+---------------+\n| 1st place for the Winter Hackathon       | 10,000.00 USD |\n| 1st-5th place prizes for Writing Contest | 5,000.00 USD  |\n+------------------------------------------+---------------+\n```\n\n# **Why this proposal?**\n\nWe believe in Kusama&#39;s approach to innovation and its community has proven very supportive to SNI&#39;s cause.\n\nIndeed, two Kusama parachain projects, namely Unique.Network and Kilt Protocol, have agreed to support the 28 SNI Hackathon teams by helping them build their solution. Unique.Network will offer NFT minting support and build a marketplace that creates value through NFTs transaction for the benefit of the regenerative projects at De Ceuvel. Kilt Protocol will offer to the teams&#39; developers support on how to work with the KILT SDK, and integrate the Kilt&#39;s Verifiable Credentials and DID into their Hackathon solutions.\n\nBy getting the councils financial support, the winning team will be able to further develop their solutions after the Hackathon, and further explore and use technology within the Kusama ecosystem. Moreover, this financial support will further the reach and impact of our events, enabling more regen/refi initiatives to be recognized as important players within the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n# **1. About the Tech Hackathon**\n\nWe will conduct an **Online Hackathon** from February 4th-6th, asking teams to develop ideas in **3 categories** with possible approaches listed here:\n\n- **representation of non-human life**\n  - Artistic expressions in digital media that bring to the public narratives from other forms of life that share our existence and that we co-depend to have a thriving planet\n  - Story-telling, UI, UX, user journeys, that aim to broaden the understanding of the public towards other living beings&#39; realities and expressions\n- **governance models**\n  - Web3 software solutions that tackle a particular aspect of governance for conservation, regeneration, and remediation efforts\n  - Treasury management and proposal voting systems\n  - New legal/technical governance models, such as a declaration of independence for non-human species\n  - Land Stewardship (&quot;Land Trust&quot;) and models of public/private/nature governance\n- **nature value capture**\n  - NFTs as an approach to value generation/eco-awareness where value remains &#39;in&#39; specific land/ecosystems\n  - Creative ways to remunerate data collection about ecosystems\n  - Regenerate-to-earn models to incentivize nature stewardship\n  - Data analytics and feedback as an autonomization of conservation practices\n\nThe 28 teams participating in the event will be encouraged by the judging criteria to build the business and architecture models on top of the Kusama ecosystem, specially the hackathon partners, for a DApp that helps the DeCeuvel organization with another income stream based on its on-site Nature, sensors data, and soil remediation efforts. Learn more about the [SNI Winter Hackathon here](https://sovereignnature.com/projects/odyssey2022).\n\nTo participate the teams contacted us via an on-line questionnaire and application form, that was available on our website, twitter, and other media presences. After that the participants were interviewed and vetted. Then they joined a series of events to learn about the De Ceuvel and the Kusama ecosystem partners.\n\nThe competition has a prize currently composed of donations - 10,000 $OCEAN and 3,000 $POP - and €5,000 fiat prize from SNI. In addition to that, some $KILT and $RARE will be given out to ramp-up participants to build on the protocol.\n\n**Ultimately through this programming we seek to develop tools which can give nature an identity and make it profitable.**\n\n## Judging Criteria\n\nThe judges of the hackathon in collaboration with stakeholders from De Ceuvel will be looking for the DApp ideas that show original and radical thinking while being grounded in technology and applications that can be used by people, and that have potential for practical impact.\n\nJudging criterias are divided into:\n\n- **Originality** - does it do something entirely novel, or at least take a fresh approach to an old problem? A great idea should wow both the judges and other hackers.\n- **Usefulness** - is the idea for the App practical? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfill a need people caring for De Ceuvel really have?\n- **Learning** - did the team factor in all their disposable resources and time in order to come up with the final product? How strong is their awareness of how others are attempting to solve the same problem?\n- **Adherence to Theme** - does the idea for the App adhere to the event&#39;s themes - the De Ceuvel, the 3 categories, and the Kusama and partners ecosystem? Does it implement each theme fully or just partially?\n\nA score card will be given to each Judge to help assess each DApp idea based on the criterias and scores.\n\n## Hackathon Event Schedule\n\n**February 4: 3 pm - 5 pm** - Hackathon opening convening\n\nSNI presents the challenge and welcome Teams to give a two-minute presentation of their initial ideas and vision\n\n**February 5: 1 pm - 6 pm** - Advisors sessions and Judges visits\n\nTeams meet with Advisors from diverse fields and Judges to validate what they are building. All these meetings will happen in the SNi metaverse\n\n**February 6: 5 pm** - DELIVERABLES DEADLINE\n\nTeams send all deliverables by email to the SNI team\n\n**February 6: 5 pm - 7 pm** - PITCH session\n\nTeams will have a 7-minute slot to present their solutions.\n\n**February 7: 5 pm - 6.30 pm** - Announcing the winning teams\n\nUpon the announcement, winners will be invited to briefly present their solution to the audience and receive (digital) applause and congratulations.\n\n## Judges and mentors\n\n- [**Danielle Bennett**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielleabennett), Investor, Blueyard\n- [**Trent McConaghy**](http://trent.st/), Co-Founder, Ocean Protocol\n- [**Karl Burkart**](https://www.oneearth.org/contributor/karl-burkart/), Deputy Director, OneEarth.org\n- [**Ewald Hesse**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edhesse/) **:** Co-Founder &amp; Supervisory Board Member, SNI; CEO &amp; Co-Founder, Grid Singularity\n- [**Andrea Leiter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-leiter/) **:** Co-Founder, SNI; Associate Professor of International Law at University of Amsterdam\n- [**Catherine Bischoff**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinebischoff/) **:** CEO of SNI\n\n# **2. About the Nature Speaks Writing Challenge**\n\nIn the arts sector, we will host and judge an **open creative-writing competition** called _ **&quot;Nature Speaks!&quot;** _ asking for original nature-inspired literature that broadens human perception and helps us question nature&#39;s otherness. Creative writers, especially those working in web3 / online spaces and innovative publishing platforms, are invited to submit an original work of prose or poetry in the &#39;voice&#39; or from the point of view of one or more nonhuman organisms (plant/animal) or any other aspect of nature. Winners and runners-up will see their writing published in an online publication, featured at the Experimental Zone event in Spring 2022, and the first prize winner will see their writing published and minted as an NFT using the support of the Unique.Network parachain.\n\n## How can people participate?\n\nIndividuals can submit their pieces by March 15 via a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLu7ehHHwlOLSiMuBlMIfva2kWfak1TiDM0bzEzNRm3QfZcg/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0) accessible via the Sovereign Nature website.\n\nIf anyone has questions about Nature Speaks! Literature competition, they can get in touch with SNI Writer in Residence and Challenge lead Seth Bockley at: seth@sovereignnature.com\n\n## Why A Writing Competition?\n\nWe at Sovereign Nature Initiative believe that art empowers wider and wilder engagement with our world and with the mysteries of nonhuman life. We believe that writing alongside nature can broaden human perception and help us question nature&#39;s otherness. We want to think about ourselves and our language as a metaphor for nature, and not just nature as a metaphor for us. We believe that storytelling has the ability to empower and inspire human communities to listen and look more carefully, to smell, taste and touch the deeply entangled world around us.\n\nWe&#39;re inspired by storytellers and thinkers like [Rainer Maria Rilke](https://gnomelife.bandcamp.com/album/be-earth-now-joanna-macy-anita-barrows-recite-selections-from-rainer-maria-rilkes-the-book-of-hours), [Sophie Strand](https://www.instagram.com/cosmogyny/), [Richard Powers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40180098-the-overstory), [Wendi Yan](https://eco.mirror.xyz/8_z5JQrhmCAVSU6vi4V7_r7M6HQ-pOWuAVdTNPPtIJY) and [Robert Macfarlane](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2688775-the-wild-places).\n\n## Why Kusama and NFTs?\n\nA work of creative writing is like the experience of an organism in the world: it is non-fungible, non-repeatable, unique. Artists and writers capture the value of human-nonhuman entanglement beyond what we can quantify using standard economic and ecological models. We believe NFTs can help these same artists value and share their work– this technology has already greatly impacted the visual arts ecosystem but has yet to make an equivalent impact on literature. As always, SNI wants to be ahead of the curve and anticipate and pioneer how the most powerful nature-writing of the future will be valued and published.\n\n## The Prizes\n\nThe grand prize winner will see their writing made into an NFT by \\*[Unique.Network](http://unique.network/).\n\nThe winner and runners-up will split a bounty of $5,000 USD in KSM equivalent and be published on SNI&#39;s website, and featured in our digital compilation _Leaves of Grass 2.0_ at SNI&#39;s Experimental Zone event held at Amsterdam&#39;s De Ceuvel in May of 2022.\n\nA judging committee made up of writers and scientists will determine winners based entirely on the originality and affectiveness of the works submitted.\n\nAt every resale of the artwork 10% of royalties will be donated to a rewilding or conservation campaign designated by the artist and SNI at time of the NFT&#39;s creation.\n\n\n# **About Sovereign Nature Initiative**\n\nFounded in 2019, Sovereign Nature Initiative (SNI) is a non-profit Netherlands-based foundation that is reconfiguring the intersection between ecology, economy, and emerging web3 technologies, and aims to **achieve a thriving planet by reconfiguring nature&#39;s value.** To support this vision, SNI&#39;s tech stack is being developed in Substrate while we host hackathons to engage developers communities and get their constant feedback. We have brought together multiple partners and engineers from the Kusama ecosystem including [Kodadot](https://nft.kodadot.xyz/), [Unique Network](https://unique.network/), [Kilt Protocol](https://kilt.io/), and [Ocean Protocol](https://oceanprotocol.com/), and are looking for any other initiative in the Kusama ecosystem that is willing to help us **break the cycle of human domination over &#39;nature&#39;**. Our February 2022 Hackathon is inspired by [De Ceuvel,](https://deceuvel.nl/en/about/general-information/) a post-industrial reclaimed former shipyard in North Amsterdam that operates as a sustainable planned workplace for creative and social enterprises, a unique land trust, and a laboratory for new ideas. Together with other stakeholders who are part of the SNI ecosystem, the top three winning teams will be invited and have the opportunity to showcase their ideas at a public event at De Ceuvel in Amsterdam in May 2022.\n\n## Applicants:\n\n[**Ewald Hesse**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edhesse/) **:** Co-Founder &amp; Supervisory Board Member SNI, CEO &amp; Co-Founder at Grid Singularity\n\n[**Florian Schmitt**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florianschmitt/) **:** Co-Founder &amp; Supervisory Board wMember\n\n[**Andrea Leiter**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-leiter/) **:** Co-Founder at SNI, Associate Professor of International Law at University of Amsterdam\n\n[**Catherine Bischoff**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinebischoff/) **:** CEO at SNI\n\n[**Jean-Paul Depraz**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pauldepraz/) **:** CTO at SNI\n\n[**Seth Bockley**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-bockley-b4273a212/) **:** Writer-in-Residence at SNI\n\n[**Kaidlyne Neukam**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaidlyne-neukam/) **:** Program Manager &amp; Communications\n\n[**Alessandro Mazzi**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-mazzi-7a445970/) **:** Project Manager &amp; Partnerships",

Selecting the best performing Validators in the network\n2. Getting recommendations with the latest top ranked Validators\n3. Displaying a contextual call to action to nominate\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ilDaMoz.png)\n\nWith this proposal we intend to further develop our previous tool released to the community earlier this year. This includes rebranding, a new fresh look and a bunch of new cool features that we think the Polkadot and Kusama community will find useful.\n\nThe full proposal with a detailed description and costs can be found here:\n[https://hackmd.io/@dE-4mfAUSPqIubXD8Bl50Q/Bk39ZHD5Y](https://hackmd.io/@dE-4mfAUSPqIubXD8Bl50Q/Bk39ZHD5Y)\n\nBefore writing this Treasury proposal, we took a step further. We  decided to make several optimizations in our current codebase and implement most of our new Design guidelines. As a result we decided to publish our new site and **Nomi v2-beta**. Please try it out here → [beta.turboflakes.io](https://beta.turboflakes.io/#/kusama?#nomi). \n\nAny feedback is welcome.\n\nPlease review our full [proposal](https://hackmd.io/@dE-4mfAUSPqIubXD8Bl50Q/Bk39ZHD5Y). \n\n\n",

We found a problem, during the last quarter, with the scaling of the RPC-service and have spent a lot of time troubleshooting this bottleneck. We published a report in this [Github-issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/4064#issuecomment-979449201) about it. This optimization work will reduce the cost for all RPC service providers in the community. \n\n\nThis proposal only covers Milestone 1 and 2 for now, while in upcoming maintenance proposals we will submit Milestone 1 (continued maintenance) and Milestone 3 (further development of the RPC code).\n\n- Our RPC service is online and the pull request can be [found here](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/pull/6620). \n- Our full proposal can be [read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B1AjPj8yfi4JPvR0sCdh0sdBGGduIPkeRxAwTpPGD-U/edit?usp=sharing). \n- KSM rate base on 30 day avg tool by Subscan: [Available HERE](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)",

      "content": "This treasury proposal is Between the Kusama Council and MIDLDEV OÜ, a company registered in Estonia with registry number 14973249, commonly known as MIDL.dev.\n\n## Service description\n\n* A functioning infrastructure to provide usable blockchain database snapshots for the Kusama network, to the benefit of node operators and validators,\n* New snapshots at least once per day. Snapshots are filesystem dumps of the Kusama node storage backend files, of variety RocksDb, of type pruned, with a depth of 1000 blocks, compressed in 7z format, that can be used by validators to quickly spin up or restore their infrastructure,\n* A website frontend at polkashots.io with relevant metadata and download links, including a permanent link that always redirects to the most recent snapshot,\n* Best effort incident and problem management,\n* Redundant implementation setup which allows for continuity, seamless upgrades and basic disaster recovery & contingency management.\n\n## Context\nNode operators must have a contingency plan for loss of storage. For us at MIDL.dev, it consists of regularly taking snapshots of the node filesystem and backing it up for recovery if needed. We regularly generate these archives for our own benefit as well as the community. All cloud automation code used for generation of snapshots is [open-source](https://github.com/midl-dev/polkadot-snapshot-generator) so node operators can easily replicate the setup in order to be in full control of the generated snapshots.\n\nThe website polkashots.io has been operational for a year now and providing Polkadot and Kusama pruned snapshots for validators. It has had excellent uptime. It is very frequently mentioned in the Validator Lounge Matrix channels and there are youtube videos referencing them. It is beneficial to the ecosystem by providing a path for validators to quickly and safely recover from a storage failure or migrate their operations.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nThe warp sync feature has been implemented in Polkadot 0.9.9, however it still requires several hours for a full sync.\n\nA unique snapshot service that many independent validators relies on constitues a centralization risk. It remains our hope that other ecosystem participants will step in and offer an alternative service.\n\n## Operational expenses\n\nThe labor cost is 660 EUR/month including 2 engineers in 2 geographical locations (Western US and Western Europe).\n\nIn addition, we pass along the cloud costs with a 30% markup.\n\nPolkashots is hosted on google cloud. Google cloud has the concept of \"projects\" which allows for segregation of costs. The cloud cost is determined as follows:\n\n* from June 1 to October 10, 2021, polkashots was hosted in a google cloud project shared with other MIDL.dev services named \"MIDLUS\" for which we estimate about 30% of the costs were incurred by generation and download of Kusama snapshots.\n* from October 11, 2021 to November 30, 2021, we moved polkashots to a dedicated google cloud project named \"MIDLPS\", allowing for the most precise cost calculation. We arbitrarily allocate 50% of these costs to Polkadot and 50% to Kusama. A dedicated project for each network would incur overhead costs that we do not feel are necessary.\n\nA majority of these costs are network egress. Google cloud egress costs are in the higher range, similar to Azure and Amazon. Google cloud has two tiers, premium ($0.12/Gb for most regions) and standard ($0.85/Gb for most regions). The premium tier is using google private network across the globe. Polkashots uses the premium tier.\n\nThe costs have gone upwards after the introduction of parachains. This is due to the increased storage requirement of the relay chain node in the presence of parachains: as of this writing, a pruned kusama node with 1000 blocks uses 50Gi of storage (7z compressed). In other terms, it costs the treasury $6 each time someone downloads a Kusama snapshot.\n\nThe usage of the best cloud platform money can buy is justified by the benefits: a faster download speed and better reliability means that the nodes are more apt to recover quickly in case of accidental loss of storage, making the entire network more resilient.\n\nScreenshots of the billing console are attached for reference.\n\n## Usage\n\nFrom the MIDLPS billing screenshot, we can see 17,262 Gibibytes of download from the period Oct 10-Nov 31 from all regions excluding Asia and Australia. Polkadot snapshot size is 17Gi and Kusama snapshot size is 50Gi, so assuming a medium download file size of 34Gi, there were 500 downloads during the period, or **10 downloads per day**. This is a combined figure for Polkadot and Kusama networks.\n\n## Note\n\nThis proposal is for the Kusama portion of polkashots. We will be submitting a similar proposal to the Polkadot council.\n\n## Budget\n\n```\n| Cost item                                      | cost             |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Labor, monthly                                 | 660 EUR /mo      |\n| Labor, total for period                        | 3960 EUR         |\n| Cloud costs, MIDLUS June-Oct 10                | 7,737.79 EUR     |\n| 30% Kusama portion, MIDLUS + 30% markup        | 3,017.74 EUR     |\n| Cloud costs, MIDLPS Oct 11-Nov                 | 2,983.69 EUR     |\n| 50% Kusama portion, MIDLPS + 30% markup        | 1,939.40 EUR     |\n| Cloud costs, total for period                  | 4,957.14 EUR     |\n| Domain name, annually                          | 28 EUR/year      |\n| Domain name, total for period                  | 14 EUR           |\n| Total for period                               | **8,931.14 EUR** |\n| Exchange rate KSM/EUR 2021-12-14 EMA30          | 289.96 (327.273 USD)    |\n| Total base price in KSM                        | 30.80              |\n| Slippage + conversion fee 5%                   | 1.54              |\n| Proposal (KSM)                                 | 32.34             |\n```\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RSV2fZS.png)\n![](https://i.imgur.com/T74SsKq.png)\n",

Among them, the function changes of [Pallet-Contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/projects/6#column-5694481) and [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) mainly include\n\n- **Change of Pallet-contracts**\n    - Refactors\n        - [PR#9838](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9838) contracts: Refactor dispatchables\n        - [PR#8604](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8604) contracts: Refactor the exec module\n        - [PR#9669](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9669) remove rent contracts: Remove state rent\n    - update about host_func\n        - [PR#10366](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10366) Stabilize \"seal1\" seal_call\n        - [PR#9609](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9609) Contracts pallet - Add support for recovering public key from elliptic curve signatures (ECDSA) \n    - update about debug_message \n        - [PR#9550](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9550) Stabilize seal_debug_message\n        - [PR#9051](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9051) seal_debug_message not showing up in process output\n    - update about wasm executor\n        - [PR#10173](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10173) Refactor sp-sandbox; make sure both sandbox executors are always tested\n        - [PR#10268](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/10268) Forward wasmer-sandbox feature to sp-sandbox\n        - [PR#5920](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/5920) Integrate Wasmer into Substrate sandbox environment\n- **Change of ink!**\n    - [PR#792](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/792) Implement seal_debug_message\n    - [PR#914](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/914) Implemented ECDSA recover function.\n    - [PR#903](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/903) Cleanup metadata codegen slightly\n    - [PR#845](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/845) Update to scale-info 1.0, introduce metadata format versioning\n    - [PR#665](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/665) Implement new trait definition codegen rocket\n    - [PR#997](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/pull/977) Use edition 2021\n\nIn addition, we paid a lot of cloud server and bandwidth costs for API service [Elara](https://elara.patract.io). The following is a summary of the maintenance work and cost of each product in the past year:\n\n### Himalia (12 months)\n\nHimalia is our Wasm contract multi-language SDK, divided into Go/Python version. More than a year ago, we completed the development of [version 0.2](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/428). After that, the maintenance work of the Github repo are as follows:\n\n- [PatractGo](https://github.com/patractlabs/go-patract/):\n    - Submitted [16 Commits](https://github.com/patractlabs/go-patract/commits/master).\n    - Updated version to support metadata14 format modification\n    - Update all test cases to support the latest version of ink!\n    - Add erc721 example\n    - Add delegator test cases for contract mutual calls\n    - Fix other discovered problems\n- [PatractPy](https://github.com/patractlabs/py-patract):\n    - Added [6 Commits](https://github.com/patractlabs/py-patract/commits/master).\n    - Updated version to support metadata14 format modification\n    - Update all test cases to support the latest version of ink!\n\nThe maintenance costs are:\n\n- 1 maintainer * monthly salary $200 * duration 12 months = $2400\n\n### Elara for Kusama (12 months), Statemine (7 months), Westend (8 months), Westmint (7 months)\n\nElara is a node API service similar to Ethereum Infura. By building a middleware service layer, we can provide large number of users to visit by a small number of nodes. More than a year ago, we completed the development of [version 0.2](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/566). After that, the main maintenance cost is from maintainer and cloud service.\n\nmaintenance cost ($74980) :\n\n- 1 maintainer * monthly salary $500 * duration 12 months = $6000\n- The total cost of Alibaba Cloud service in Singapore is  $68980 (434579 CNY), the details are as follows:\n    * The unit price of each service is: ![](https://i.imgur.com/AvJAO8g.png)\n    * Resources and costs actually consumed by each network：![](https://i.imgur.com/KNMXpNB.png)\n    * This is the screenshot of the Alibaba Cloud bill, the total cost is 805773 CNY, from which the Polkadot/ Statemint services should be paid by the Polkadot Treasury are 204969 CNY, and the Kusama/ Statemine/ Westend/ Westmint services should be paid by the Kusama Treasury are 434579 CNY, the rest are for other community chains. ![](https://i.imgur.com/sTdr23e.png)\n    * This is the screenshot of the Elara website statistics, total is 97352 GB / 6.06 Billion Requests, from which the traffic for Polkadot/Statemint is 18693 GB, for Kusama/ Statemine/ Westend/ Westmint is 77572 GB, the rest are for other community chains. ![](https://i.imgur.com/zpmA37M.png)\n\n### Summary (2021)\n\n$2400 (Himalia) + $6000 (Elara maintainer) + $68980 (Elara cloud) = $77380 / Monthly avg price of KSM $330 = 234 KSM",

This proposal covers phase 2 of the project. \n\nAlthough the White Paper and other technical articles about Polkadot and Kusama protocols aim to educate in the understanding of this technology, it is hard for token holders to visualise how the protocol works in an integrated way - this project aims to provide one of the possible visual interpretations of the dynamics behind Polkadot and its elements. The intricacies of showcasing in detail how the Kusama and Polkadot protocols function adds multiple levels of complexities to consider, when designing a piece in conjunction with a preexisting piece of music. This project should be understood as an experiment for educational purposes, playing with the interpretation of a track rhythm and the design chosen to represent the stages of the protocol processes in place, with the goal to understand Kusama's and Polkadot's architecture.\n\nWe're happy to conclude Phase 1 of the project and present you our work so far, as well as the laid out plan for Phase 2.\n\nLink to Phase 2 of the proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AmiokdP7Re4O6YA9ribIgUwQkb07QVhT9BLxaWuyp0g/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nLink to the previous Phase 1 which was approved can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/353)\n\n- Link to Phase 1 report can be found [HERE](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/353#929c5265-ba06-4c2c-89a0-06674bf3950e).\n\n- KSM rate is based on daily chart by [Subscan](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).\n\n- KSM Rate: 383.69 USD. \n\n",

      "content": "**Proponent:** DQKDxdDvG6CMPasExAHC9H9VSpB6d8CcKnspphwXs28FzC6\n\n**Date:** 10.11.2021\n\n**Requested USD:** USD 14,728.00 Quarterly (USD 4,909.33 Monthly)\n\n**Short description:** Parachains.info provides users of the Polkadot ecosystem with a centralised repository of unbiased information regarding parachain projects and auctions.  This proposal seeks to obtain funding for the continued operation, maintenance and development of the website. \n\n**Problem Statement:**\nParachains are a fundamental aspect of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.  It can however be a daunting task to find information on these projects or to compare them directly.  This is prevalent during auction periods in which would-be crowd loaners examine prospective candidates. \n\nThe auction mechanism within the ecosystem also has some complexities, it possesses two phases and a random bid winner assessment point.  Present auction interfaces focus primarily on which project has raised the most capital.  There was no public tool that represented the auction events on a timeline.  This representation was useful when examining the events of auction nine (9), in which a project won due to the timing of the candle end.\n\nThe full details of the proposal can be found using this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XG5AnLF5lJtz-Muxqx801ndh_wDN1iWOPk7-2brJGbc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n- Kusama rate at $405.583 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n- Discussion was initiated here -> [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1091](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1091) but no feedback was received.",

Our mission is to support the Polkadot protocol in achieving its vision of a multi-chain future through providing easy-to-use, reliable, and scalable infrastructure services which removes an entire layer of complexities for developers to start building on Polkadot/Substrate.\n\nWe launched our MVP in June 2021 offering free API endpoint access to users to both Polkadot and Kusama mainnets and testnets. We've served more than 200 million requests through our users' custom endpoints and public endpoints. You may begin utilizing our endpoints by [signing up for an account](https://app.pinknode.io/login) or through our public endpoints listed [here](https://apps.pinknode.io/#/explorer).\n\nIn our Phase 1 proposal, we will be detailing our plan to enhance our front-end for better user experience, management and monitoring capabilities. With these planned enhancements, our users will be able to:\n\n- easily manage their project keys\n\n- uncover valuable insights into their usage methods and patterns, which will positively influence the development of their dApp\n\n- collaborate effectively with other team members to manage infrastructure needs\n\nThis will help advance the developer team’s operational capabilities by providing greater ease of use, visibility, and enhanced account management.\n\nYou can find out more about our proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XBWBRNuEl1bJBfiD1TyEZN-k4PonabV2Wr7p8DKED1E/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n- This submission covers Phase 1\n\n- Kusama rate at $347.19 as per [Subscan 30 day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n\n[Link to recent discussion on Polkadot Discussion](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/626).\n",

This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n- Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n- Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n- Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we’ve made Github issues based on behaviour we’ve observed)\n\n### Service Details\n\nBetween 2021-07-01 and 2021-09-30 our Kusama API service has:\n\n- Served an unprecedented total of 8,033,980,647 (8 billion) requests (an increase of 210% on the previous quarter)\n- Accumulated almost 56 TB of data egress (up 335.54% on Q2)\n- The highest daily total was 229,333,292 requests and 1.5TB data egress in a single 24 hour period\n- Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 145 million requests each day.\n- Rococo had over 75 million API requests in the period, and Statemine over 186 million\n- All time totals for Kusama is 10,895,178,172 (10 Billion) since November\n- The last billion Kusama requests took only 7 days\nNote: We have implemented custom middleware in our platform that counts and logs these requests, [you can view the raw data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IgNgwGNQle-8xzS7W3A7PmXX-rI08pknAhG-hllcfw0/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRfLGHvC9UgKOU0AFSxOjbtqjm81OBXlSvYt70fK6uGqB1sE0WvPXKRdWv5J3Rf3egvV6pP1cLFZunS/pubchart?oid=577419954&format=image)\n\n### Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Kusama ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n- An improved dashboard for our partners so that they can monitor usage and manage the upgrades of the nodes in real time.\n- Collection of a rich set of metrics and usage data that is securely shared with partners to help them scale and develop their network.\n- Improvements to our routing strategies and scale enhancements to our load balancer with the goal of scaling to a Billion daily requests.\n- A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is met.\n- Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to **every **parachain team at launch\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/).\n\nWe continue to reaffirm our dedication to providing free support of 500,000 requests to our API service each day for users around the world. You can access our public API service by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/explorer) or via the endpoints listed below. You can also [create your own free API key in our application](https://app.onfinality.io) and track metrics and statistics.\n\n- https://kusama.api.onfinality.io/public\n- wss://kusama.api.onfinality.io/public-ws\n- https://rococo.api.onfinality.io/public\n- wss://rococo.api.onfinality.io/public-ws\n- https://statemine.api.onfinality.io/public\n- wss://statemine.onfinality.io/public-ws\n\n[**Full report including detailed data and costing**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C7QVo0YCepSk70p3fQKihmoJs9YZunoI_771yxBNRJY/edit?usp=sharing)",

How many communities have evolved and how active are they?\n* Has the Encointer Association shown good governance and is there a plausible roadmap towards full decentralization?\n\n# funds\n\nThe proposed treasury spend of 35'800 USD has been translated to KSM at today's 30d average on [subscan EMA30](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) of 364.947 USD",

      "content": "Nibble bits is a creative duo from London, England with over a decade of Visual Effects experience on shows like Jungle Book, which they won an Academy Award for. They've also been honored to work alongside many amazing artists and projects like Ed Sheeran & Chance The Rapper’s music video, The Last of Us 2 trailer, Xbox Series X cinematic, Ridley Scott’s Hennessy short-film and brands such as Apple, Samsung, Heineken, amongst others. In reality though, ‘Nibble bits’ is just the lovechild of two artists making art outside the boundaries imposed by the commercial world.\n\nAlthough the White Paper and other technical articles about Polkadot and Kusama protocols aim to educate in the understanding of this technology, it is hard for token holders to visualise how the protocol works in an integrated way - this project aims to provide one of the possible visual interpretations of the dynamics behind Polkadot and its elements. The intricacies of showcasing in detail how the Kusama and Polkadot protocols function adds multiple levels of complexities to consider, when designing a piece in conjunction with a preexisting piece of music.\n\nThis project should be understood as an experiment for educational purposes, playing with the interpretation of a track rhythm and the design chosen to represent the stages of the protocol processes in place, with the goal to understand Kusama's and Polkadot's architecture. \nNevertheless, the focus should primarily be an amazing looking music video with addictively compelling aesthetics that can be enjoyed as a piece in its own right.\n\nLink to the full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E14oPe0YU8jXA7Rp4khelZwGTNqJsFfEUTi9tRpVrDo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWe're looking forward to any feedback and comments. Really excited to be part of this!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nKSM rate based on 30-day average rate tool by subscan - $345\n\nPlease note this proposal covers the first allocation for the work of two months. \n\nA second final proposal will be submitted after pending council review of the progress report.",

The result will be, that users aren’t forced to switch between apps, chains and reload their window context completely.\n\nFirst of all, our aim since every grant till today is to have [an open-source UI with permissive MIT license and support developers to fork and contribute to repository, as till today we have 60+ forks.](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/blob/main/LICENSE) \n\nOur primary deliverable will be an extension of KodaDot: an NFT explorer to **work with the Statemine’s unique** pallet.\n\n**The main goal of this proposal is to provide a simple friendly NFT UI to the end-users to open flood gates to mainstream adoption of non-fungible tokens for Statemine**\n\n**Milestone 1: Non-fungible tokens**\n\nThe first milestone is focused on the three main sections: \n- Teleport $KSM between Kusama Relay Chain and Statemine\n- Implement a user interface to create, burn, transfer NFTs (and many more)\n- Design and setup the SubQuery indexing service, which could be reused by other projects\n\n**Deliverables**\n- Make a page dedicated to creating a unique (NFT) with a simple workflow\n- Ability to create a Class (collection)\n- Show class detail with metadata\n- Show minted NFTs in explorer mode\n- Ability to set and remove approval for instances \n- Display metadata for particular NFT (instance)\n- Transfer (send) ownership for class and instance\n- Set metadata for class and instance\n- Set attributes for class and instance\n- Burn an instance\n- Clear metadata and attributes.\n- Implement a page to teleport KSM between Kusama and Statemine\n- Extend vue-polkadot/api to handle multiple (parallel connections).\n- Provide check if a user has enough balance on Statemine / Kusama to be able to mint and transfer a collection.\n- Implement a GraphQL schema for Classes and instances\n- Extend the embeddable component that will work with the Statemine implementation (note: embeddable component -> <iframe/> which would work as a page generator to show particular collections or by addresses on other existing web applications )\n- Write introduction article around experience with development around unique pallet implementation\n- Write introduction article presenting using KodaDot on Statemine\n\n**Amount required -- 27_000 €**\n\nBudget breakdown\nMilestone 1 - non-fungible interface for Statemine in KodaDot\n- Teleport interface for $KSM - 4k€\n- Implement interface & flow \n- - Easier NFT creation - 9k€\n- - Showcase & Displaying NFT assets - 6k€\n- Design query and deploy SubQuery project - 8k€\n\n\n### Team\n\nThe team behind [@KodaDot](https://twitter.com/kodadot)\n\n- Matej Nemcek ([@yangwao](https://twitter.com/yangwao)) - Co-Founder of KodaDot, VueJS background, more info [hypersignal.xyz](https://hypersignal.xyz)\n- Viktor Valastin ([@vikiival](https://twitter.com/vikiival)) - Co-Founder of KodaDot, [Publication about carsharing dApp on ETH using ERC721 token composition.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335241161_Blockchain_Based_Car-Sharing_Platform)\n\n\n",

      "title": "Proposal to fund PolkaStats operation costs for Kusama network from 01.09.2021 to 01.12.2021",
      "content": "- **Proponent:** PolkaStats [GTzRQPzkcuynHgkEHhsPBFpKdh4sAacVRsnd8vYfPpTMeEY](https://kusama.polkastats.io/account/GTzRQPzkcuynHgkEHhsPBFpKdh4sAacVRsnd8vYfPpTMeEY)\n- **Date**: 23-08-2021\n- **Requested amount:** 2.939 KSM\n\nHi all,\n\nThis is a new treasury spent proposal to fund PolkaStats operation costs for Kusama network from 01.09.2021 to 01.12.2021.\n\n### CONTEXT\n\n[PolkaStats](https://kusama.polkastats.io/) is a Substrate block explorer aiming to provide the best staking and economic data for both validators and nominators. It helps both types of users by providing comprehensive metrics, charts and utilities to improve their knowledge and performance.\n\nPolkaStats is one of the projects that was born in La Colmena, a crypto community based in Sevilla, southern Spain. The community aims to incentivize content-creation in Spanish for Polkadot, Kusama and other blockchain projects and, as supporters of open source culture, develop software to contribute to the ecosystem. The organization also acts like an incubator that helped create blockchain business models like DragonStake or Delega Networks validators.\n\nAlthough there are currently already some very good Substrate explorers in the ecosystem, PolkaStats has a different perspective to offer in order to increase diversity among the existing solutions. PolkaStats differentiates from other explorers in:\n\n- Focusing on Proof of Stake chains only.\n- Being a full Javascript based block explorer (both frontend and backend)\n- Utilising Vue.js, Nuxt.js and GraphQL with a soft learning curve.\n\n### SPENDING PROPOSAL\n\nPolkaStats aims to submit a spending proposal to the Kusama Treasury on the following terms:\n\n- A 3 month period pre-paid funding for operational expenses, which totals to 2.939 KSM for the period 01.09.2021 - 01.12.2021.\n- KSM base-price is determined using EMA30 price from Subscan: $264.574 (225.60 €)\n- The funds are used to pay the servers we rent to Hetzer and Digital Ocean in order to operate PolkaStats for the Kusama network.\n\n### MONTHLY BUDGET\n\nPlease find below a detailed budget of PolkaStats monthly operational costs for Kusama network:\n\n- Hetzner AX61-NVMe (KUSAMA): 99.96 €\n- Hetzner AX61-NVMe (DEVELOPMENT): 99.96 €\n- ½ Digital Ocean 4 vCPUs 8GB / 160GB Disk (DEVELOPMENT): 16.92 €\n- ½ Digital Ocean 1 vCPUs 2GB / 50GB Disk (MONITORING): 4.23 €\n- TOTAL: 221.07 € / Month\n- TOTAL KSM (1 KSM = 225.60 €): 0.979 KSM / Month\n\nNOTE: Conversion rate of 1 KSM = $264.5745 = 225.60 € was calculated using [EMA30 price](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/price_converter?value=1&type=block&from=KSM&to=USD&time=0) from Subscan at 23/08/2021\n\n### PREVIOUS APPROVED PROPOSALS\n\nProposal I:\n\n- Period: 17.09.2020 - 17.12.2021\n- Document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA) \n- Discussion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/290](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/290) \n- Executed at block #4,086,175 (2020-09-17 11:37:36)\n- Treasury proposal: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/47](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/47) \n- Motion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/214 ](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/214 )\n\nProposal II:\n\n- Period: 17.12.2020 - 17.03.2021\n- Discussion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/480](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/480) \n- Executed at block #6,091,572 (2021-02-06 09:32:12)\n- Treasury proposal: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/77](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/77) \n- Motion: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/268](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/268)  \n\n### SOME KUSAMA METRICS\n\nGoogle Analytics metrics of the Kusama version of PolkaStats in the last month:\n\n- 1822 unique users\n- 2385 sessions\n- Visitors from 92 different countries",

Check [here](https://www.dotreasury.com/dot/projects/dotreasury) for this project history.\n\n## Maintenance\n\n### Server\n\nServer fees for 05.2021 and 07.2021: (8vCPU + 16G + 1 TB SSD + 10Mbps) * 3 = $450 * 3 = $1350\n\nservices run in this server:\n\n- 2 polkadot archive node instance for Polkadot and Kusama\n- 1 polkadot-collator archive node instance for Statemine\n- 1 mongodb instance\n- dotreasury\n  - scan scripts for production and staging environments\n  - dotreasury restful server for production and staging environments\n- metadata scan scripts for production and staging. We use these scripts to scan store the raw block/events data, so we don't have to read them from the node.\n- Statescan\n  - scan scripts for production and staging environments\n  - Statescan restful server for production and staging environments\n- Price tracker scripts\n- Some other scripts like monitors\n\nWe'd say this server is a little tired, and we may increase 1 or 2 servers in next season.\n\n### Continuous development\n\nWe are still actively developing to improve it. Please check the code [diff](https://github.com/opensquare-network/dotreasury/compare/e8f09bf9cfcbf352425555734c022c59c9ba72ea...release-2.3.1#diff-0b59de8f2b2804ca9674c9716edbeffaf6038e24c590a42bb0a55dee9052f037) from last delivery. Our work includes:\n\n1. We improved the way to check the target calls recursively, so we won't miss some actions without events, check code [here](https://github.com/opensquare-network/dotreasury/commit/153eeecb65a7d683f45fbf43fd458c1006b7ac5b#diff-0b59de8f2b2804ca9674c9716edbeffaf6038e24c590a42bb0a55dee9052f037R15)\n2. Improve page performance by only connecting 1 node when page init\n3. Add funded projects and related links for proposals manually\n4. Continually track the polkadot.js releases and update dotreasury dependencies to make it work for latest runtime\n5. Some UI improvements and bugs, like show voting members on proposal list, fiat value punctuation, link recognition, etc.\n\nWe request 10 days cost for 1 developer, and it's $500 \\* 10 = $5000.\n\n## Part of M3 work\n\nYou can see the original M3 plan [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#182dea63-f93f-4f66-aa4f-e7a03bb483ab) and a [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/598) we raise about beneficiary credit model.\nWe still can not decide the best model for a credit score, but we can first let the grade action happen.\nThat means councilors and any token holders can grade 1-5 for a proposal and leave a short message, and they have to sign it with polkadot.js extension which we will store to IPFS.\nOf course anybody can see these grades with the verified signatures.\n\nWe request $1500 for this feature development.\n\n## Metrics\n\nPlease check metrics from cloudflare. The visitors are not so many. Sorry that our social media followers are very few and maybe we need some work to promote it.\n![](https://ipfs-hk.decoo.io/ipfs/QmPvXz8NMmK8jTUMVgY8kxTefAEkrrntx6R1boqSZSp2eR?filename=Lark20210802-145516.png)\n\n## Total cost\n\nThe work is for both kusama and polkadot, but to make the on-chain work simple, we apply from kusama and polkadot in turn every 3 monthes.\n\n```javascript\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Description                             | Time          | Cost  |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Server(8vCPU + 16G + 1 TB SSD + 10Mbps) | last 3 months | $1350 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Continuous maintenance development      | last 3 months | $5000 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Support grading and IPFS storage        | 2 weeks       | $1500 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n| Total                                   |               | $7850 |\n+-----------------------------------------+---------------+-------+\n```\n\nI will calc the KSM amount when propose it on-chain with the MA30 price if no problems.\n\n---\n[OpenSquare team](https://www.opensquare.network/team), we develop public goods and are dedicated to facilitate the collaboration between projects and developers.",

      "content": "This is copy from [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/766](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/766)\n\nAsk!'s goal is to provide a set of contract frameworks and compilation tools using AssemblyScript as the programming language. Contracts written through Ask! can run in the FRAME Pallet-Contracts , and eventually can call each other with contracts written by ink!. One month before, Ask! had completed the development of v0.2, and here was [Development Report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/639), External [Review Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_fEiXdshfeTm8KbKq9JZbdcVv_iQ-LbuWQdYS2k1yKI/edit?usp=sharing) and [Review Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18pfqLaDGbU6EKRKzOMsY40I6kFrlwStWu-g2LaqvOq0/edit) for the previous version. After v0.3, we will release Ask! 1.0 as the first production version for massive test and usage for community developers and detailed [docs](https://docs.patract.io/en/ask/introduction.html).\n\n## Main features of v0.3\n\nThis proposal will complete the following functions on the basis of v0.2:\n\n### 1. Add project management tool `ask-cli`\n\nThe positioning and function of `ask-cli` is similar to that of `cargo contract`, it mainly completes the following functions:\n\n   * Initialize the Ask! project. Provide `ask-cli init` command to create a new contract project. It will mainly complete the following tasks:\n     * Check the current latest version of `ask`, and the dependencies of ask.\n     * Create a project directory and initialize basic settings.\n     * Download/update all dependencies to the local directory.\n   * Encapsulate the compilation process of ask.\n     * Provide `ask-cli compile` command to control the compilation process. The `compile` command will provide two modes of `debug` and `release`, and the default is to use the `release` mode to compile. among them: \n       * In the `debug` mode, debugging information will be generated in the `.wasm` file, and the `.wast` and `metadata.json` files will be generated at the same time, and the files expanded by Preprocessor will be saved to the `extension/` folder.\n       * In `release` mode, the highest level of optimization options will be used to compile, and only `.wasm` and `metadata.json` files will be generated.\n\n### 2. Performance optimization\n\n#### 2.1 Merging the functions of `@storage` into `@contract`, reducing the process of state variable definition.\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2 version, the `@storage` annotation was introduced, which is specifically used to mark that a certain class is used to save state variables, such as:\n\n```typescript\n@storage\nclass StateVariable {\n  varA: i8;\n  varB: u8;\n  @ignore\n  varC: bool\n  // ...\n}\n\n@contract\nclass Contract {\n  sv: StateVariable;\n  // ...\n\n  @message\n  msgA(): void {\n    this.sv.varA = 8;\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith this implementation method, the original purpose is to distinguish state variables and ordinary variables, so that when some parameters need to be passed across methods, ordinary variables can be used without additional storage burden, but this requirement is in v0.2 With the introduction of `@ignore`, there can be better implementations. At the same time, the use of `@storage` to distinguish variable types has obvious disadvantages:\n\n1. Introduced additional coding burden, each time you use it, you need to use the writing method of `this.sv.varA`.\n2. When the contract has an inheritance relationship, it is not convenient to arrange the storage location of the data in the subclass and the parent class.\n\nTherefore, in v0.3, the functions of `@storage` and `@contract` will be merged. The contract in the above example can be written more directly as follows:\n\n```typescript\n@contract\nclass Contract {\n  varA: i8;\n  varB: u8;\n  @ignore\n  varC: bool\n  // ...\n\n  @message\n  msgA(): void {\n    this.varA = 8;\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.2 Optimize the key generation logic used when storing state variables: Use continuous hash data instead of dynamic hash(string).\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2, the key used when storing state variables is obtained by calculating `hash(\"_lang_ask.contract.varA\")`. This generation method is not convenient for more reasonable arrangement of storage locations, especially for collection types such as map and array.\n\nIn v0.3, for non-@ignore variables defined in the contract, storage locations will be generated in an orderly manner according to their declaration order (including variables of the parent class), as in the above example。The storage location of `varA` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001`, the storage location of `varB` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002`... and so on.\n\n#### 2.3 In the process of a message call, when the value of the state variable is changed multiple times, reduce the number of calls to `seal_set_storage`\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2, every time the value of the state variable is changed, the `seal_set_storage` method will be called in real time to save the result to the chain. The advantage of this implementation is that the value of the state variable will change in real time, which is very important when calling each other across contracts. But in most cases, it is not necessary to update state variables in real time, which will waste gas and consume IO operations.\n\nIn v0.3, the state variable will be updated in a lazy way, that is: in the process of a message call, the value of the state variable can be modified multiple times, but only after the message call is completed, will the final result be saved to the chain , So no matter how many times the state variable is modified, the `seal_set_storage` method will only be called once. At the same time, in order to meet the need to update state variables in real time when calling across contracts, a new annotation `@immediately` is introduced, which is annotated on state variables. If the state variable of @immediately is modified, its value will be real-time Update to the chain.\n\n```typescript\n  @contract\nclass Contract {\n  varA: i8;\n  @immediately\n  varB: u8;\n  // ...\n\n  @message\n  msgA(): void {\n    this.varA = 9; // won't update onchain value\n    // ...\n    this.varA = 18; // won't update onchain value\n    this.varB = 19; // update onchain value to 19 immediately\n    // ...\n    this.varB = 29; // update onchain value to 29 immediately\n\n    // ...\n    // update onchain value of this.varA to 18\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.4 Define the export format of Map and Array in metadata.json.\n\nIn v0.2, we provide the implementation of `StorableMap` and `StorableArray`, and in spread mode, they are saved as a doubly linked list, so that you can iteratively access all the data in `StorableMap` and `StorableArry` offline through the information provided in metadata.json. In order to achieve this goal, we will generate the necessary information for the StorableMap and StorableArray in the `storage` object of metadata.json. For StorableMap, its storage information is like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"someMap\",\n  \"layout\": {\n    \"struct\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {// StorableMap info of entry node\n          \"name\": \"entries\",\n          \"type\": \"spread\", // storage mode, \"spread\" | \"packed\"\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"key\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\" // storage position\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"key\",\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"ty\": 5 // data type of key\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"value\",\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"ty\": 5 // data type of value\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor StorableArray, like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"someArray\",\n  \"layout\": {\n    \"struct\": {\n      \"fields\": [\n        {// StorableArray info of entry\n          \"name\": \"entries\",\n          \"type\": \"spread\", // storage mode, \"spread\" | \"packed\"\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"key\": \"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002\" // storage position\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"key\",\n          \"layout\": {\n              \"ty\": 5 // data type of key\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### 2.5 Use JSON instead of `()` annotations\n\nIn the implementation of v0.2, the parameter of the annotation is provided by `()`, such as`@message(payable = true, selector = \"0x1234\")`. In v0.3, it will be: `@message({payable: true, selector: \"0x1234\"})` to improve the readability and maintainability of the code.\n\n#### 2.6 Enhance `Event` syntax, provide js library for parsing Event data\n\n   * Support @event inheritance\n     Event is essentially derived from the `_lang.Event` class, in terms of syntax they should support inheritance. But in v0.2 does not support inheritance operations, in v0.3, we will support the Event class can be inherited.\n   * Optimize the constructor and implementation method\n     In v0.2, because of the functional limitation of Proprecess, when we generate the Event construction method, we call the `emit` method by default, and the code of the Event class after the Preprocessor is expanded:\n\n```typescript\nclass Transfer extends _lang.Event {\n  private from: AccountId;\n  private to: AccountId;\n  private value: u128;\n\n  constructor(from: AccountId, to : AccountId, value: u128) {\n        super();\n        this.from = from;\n        this.to = to;\n        this.value = value;\n\n        // code inserted by compiler\n        this.emit();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis implementation has the following problems:\n\n1. If the `return` method is called in the constructor method, the `this.emit` method will not be called, resulting in the event not being sent.\n2. The emit is defaultly used when constructing the Event, which is very unintuitive in coding.\n\nFor these reasons, we will optimize the implementation of Event to avoid the above problems by providing js library to parse Event data.\n\n#### 2.7 Enhanced annotation syntax and parameter checking\n\nIn the previous version, we have successively introduced multiple annotations, sub-annotations and annotation parameters, but before compilation, there was no good check during compilation, and no clear enough prompt information was provided when an error occurred. So in the v0.3, we will check all annotations and parameters in Preprocess, and provide friendly compilation information when errors occur.\n\n#### 2.8 Optimize the size of the generated wasm file\n\n#### 2.9 Upgrade the seal_xxx method in pallet-contract\n\nSome `seal_xxx` methods in `pallet-contract` have been changed. In v0.3, the changed methods will be upgraded to the latest stable version.\n\n### 3. Provide system parameter types in custom `env`\n\nIn the previous version, we used the FRAME provided in the Europa project by default, and defined the data types of the following system-level variables:\n\n```typescript\ntype Hash Array<u8>(32);\ntype AccountId Array<u8>(32);\ntype BlockNumber UInt32;\ntype Balance UInt128;\n```\n\nAlthough the default data type can meet most of the needs, in order to meet a small number of custom requirements, we will provide developers with the ability about custom `Hash` `AccountId` `BlockNumber` `Balance` data type in the v0.3 to adapt to different FRAME.\n\n### 4. Unit Testing and Documentation\n\n* Provide unit testing of Preprocess and framework.\n* Provide tutorial documents for contract development.\n* Provide framework API documentation.\n\n## Detailed timeline v0.3  (3 developers * 10 weeks)\n\n1. Week 1~2: ask-cli\n\n  * Complete the architecture design and implementation of `ask-cli`.\n  * Implement `init`, `compile` functions.\n\n2. Week 3~6: Performance optimization work.\n\n  * Merge `@storage` to `@contract`:\n    * Expand the `@storage` logic in the implementation of contract to realize the read and write ability of state variables.\n    * Optimize the key generation logic when storing state variables.\n    * A new method is added to the implementation of contract to generate storage logic for state variables, ensuring that `seal_set_storage` is only called once.\n    * Add `@immediately` annotation, which acts on state variables, and the annotated variables will immediately call `seal_set_storage` to save.\n  * Enhance contract syntax.\n    * Standardize annotation usage, use JSON format instead of `()` method\n    * Enhance compile-time syntax checking, when encountering unsupported annotations and parameters, a compilation error will be thrown.\n    * Enhance `@event` class, optimize implementation method and support event inheritance.\n  * Optimize the size of the generated wasm file.\n  * Define the export format of Map and Array in metadata.json, and provide js parsing library.\n  * Upgrade the `seal_xxx` method to the latest stable version of pallet-contract.\n\n3.

      "content": "**tldr: Second of three milestones in which SubQuery and Fearless Wallet create an open source API that should be able to provide different types of applications with a sufficient (but read-only) view of all key data within the Kusama chain. E.g. a developer could use it to create their own chain explorer without needing to directly query chain data**\n\nWe believe that the DApps ecosystem will benefit from a common core API that each parachain can integrate (and extend) to index and expose their chain data for future consumer facing applications (e.g. a wallet, explorer, or other dApp). \n\nThere will be 3 individually proposed milestones delivering open source projects, packages, and associated learning material to help decentralised app developers start building applications on Polkadot/Kusama\n\n**Who**\n\nThis is a joint proposal between two parties - SubQuery/OnFinality and Fearless Wallet/SORAMITSU\n\n**What**\n1. Create an Open-Source SubQuery Project for Common Data\n2. Document and Publish Learning Material and Tutorials\n\n**Outcomes**\n1. Improve the Interoperability of DApps and Parachains\n2. Attract and Support More Developers in Kusama\n\n### Milestone 2\n\n**This proposal is for the 2nd milestone only.**\n\nImplement a SubQuery project that provides the data for the previously defined API spec for Kusama (from [milestone 1](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/95)).\n\nCurrent API Spec GitHub: [https://github.com/subquery/common-api-polkadot/blob/main/schema.graphql](https://github.com/subquery/common-api-polkadot/blob/main/schema.graphql)\nCurrent GraphDoc Preview: [https://subquery.github.io/common-api-polkadot/](https://github.com/subquery/common-api-polkadot/blob/main/schema.graphql)\n\nIt will be made open source (MIT license) on GitHub and uploaded to the SubQuery Explorer so it can be indexed and made available for all to query (for free).\n\nOur view is that this API should be able to provide applications with a sufficient (but read-only) view of all key data within the chain. E.g. a developer could use it to create their own chain explorer without needing to directly query chain data. One key thing to note with our core API interface is that the design should largely work across any parachain. We’ve written it with existing parachains like Karura and Moonriver in mind.\n\nYou’ll see that there are some open issues in the repository. These APIs are intended to be constantly iterated and improved over time (with considerations to backwards compatibility). We invite the Kusama community to provide feedback directly via GitHub in the form of issues and pull requests.\n\n[Please read full proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13L8HBwB6VB-n2g274FFFJKORYPJsq744C6H8iEDQ0-0/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "**Short description**\n\nThe [CryptoLab](https://www.cryptolab.network/tools) aims to help non-technical nominators build stable and risk-controlled cash flows via well-designed and financial tools. The core idea is that we want to make staking the same as an investment. Therefore, we help nominators to build good portfolios and to manage their portfolios to control risk and revenue. Portfolio management is challenging in Polkadot/Kusama system because they are NPoS consensus.\n\nWe design the CryptoLab website to help users to do their cryptocurrency financial management. Our goal is to make staking comprehensive to people who may not be yet familiar with blockchain, from basic wordings to data representation. We plan to provide the following features in this stage,\n\n- Portfolio Benchmark\n\n- Portfolio Management\n\nPortfolio Benchmark helps nominators to evaluate which validators they should stake on. They can simply choose and nominate from our pre-built strategies or set their conditions on different criteria to get a list of validators. And it is just the first step.\n\nThe real difference that makes CryptoLab outstanding is Portfolio Management. We want to help nominators track their revenue and suggest new sets of validators according to the criteria they set. In addition, we want to maintain nominators make adjustments in time to prevent profit loss by notifying them when a validator increased its commission or when a validator is being slashed.\n\nThe CryptoLab staking website supports both Polkadot and Kusama networks. Please note that this proposal is only for milestone 1 on Kusama. We will submit the milestone 2 & 3 to the Polkadot Treasury once we finish the milestone 1.\n\nPlease look at our [full proposal](https://github.com/cryptolab-network/cryptolab-staking-treasury-proposal) for more detailed information. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\nSome newly designed wireframes are following.\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3665658/121618019-a494ff80-ca98-11eb-960e-5289fc15ce1a.png)\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5772463/121611370-abb51100-ca8a-11eb-8f0b-ceaba91b5850.png)\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3665658/121618476-66e4a680-ca99-11eb-894b-3b6946a0a4d5.png)\n\n\n\n\n",

Create an Open-Source SubQuery Project for Common Data\n2. Document and Publish Learning Material and Tutorials\n\n**Outcomes**\n1. Improve the Interoperability of DApps and Parachains\n2. Attract and Support More Developers in Kusama\n\n### Milestone 1\n\n**This proposal is for the 1st milestone only.**\n\nDesign and publish the proposed common GraphQL API definition for Kusama that the remainder of this proposal will deliver. This will be published using a GitHub repository and a GraphQL documentation tool (like Graphdoc). \n\nWe will then reach out to the community for consultation and ideas around how we can improve this API (and the models within it) for more general use across different types of dApps.\n\n[Please read full proposal here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13L8HBwB6VB-n2g274FFFJKORYPJsq744C6H8iEDQ0-0/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "This treasury proposal is Between the Kusama Council and MIDLDEV OÜ, a company registered in Estonia with registry number 14973249, commonly known as [MIDL.dev](https://midl.dev/).\n\n# Service description\n\n1.  A functioning infrastructure to provide usable blockchain database snapshots for the Kusama network, to the benefit of node operators and validators,\n    \n2.  New snapshots at least once per day. Snapshots are filesystem dump of the kusama node storage backend file, of variety RocksDb, of type pruned, with a depth of 1000 blocks, compressed in 7z format, that can be used by validators to quickly spin up or restore their infrastructure,\n    \n3.  A website frontend at [polkashots.io](https://polkashots.io/) with relevant metadata and download links, including a permanent link that always redirects to the most recent snapshot,\n    \n4.  Best effort incident and problem management,\n    \n5.  Redundant implementation setup which allows for continuity, seamless upgrades and basic disaster recovery & contingency management.\n    \n6.  Make snapshots available on IPFS and pin them for 3 days\n    \n\n### Context\n\nThe website [polkashots.io](https://polkashots.io/) has been operational for 6 months now and providing Polkadot and Kusama pruned snapshots for validators. It has had excellent uptime. It is currently the only provider for this service. It is very frequently mentioned in the Validator Lounge Matrix channels and there are [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UE6GJGvIur8) referencing them. It is beneficial to the ecosystem by providing a path for validators to quickly and safely recover from a storage failure or migrate their operations.\n\n## Evolution over time\n\nShall substrate/kusama add support for a useful native snapshot format, the platform will switch to providing these formats instead of a filesystem dump.\n\nShall substrate/kusama implement a “warp sync” technology or any other technology, if this technology results in centrally managed snapshot services no longer be the most expedient way of starting or recovering a validator node, this agreement will expire and the service will cease.\n\n## Operational expenses\n\nThe labor cost is 600 EUR/month including 2 engineers in 2 different time zones. The cloud cost varies and is currently estimated at 300 EUR/month.\n\n## Funding request from Kusama treasury\n\nMIDLDEV OÜ will make funding requests to the Kusama treasury every 6 months:\n\n-   The first request will cover the period January-June 2021. The future requests will cover post-paid funding of operational expenses, for the previous 6 months.\n    \n-   Operational expenses consist of labor costs of 600 EUR/month plus the cloud costs with a 25% markup. Cloud costs include costs of operating the node, storing the files and operating the website frontend.\n    \n-   We will be operating the polkashots service in a dedicated Google Cloud project (or equivalent in a different cloud provider) for accurate metering and pricing.\n    \n-   This proposal is for Kusama, we are submitting an equivalent proposal for the Polkadot network.\n    \n\n## Budget\n```\n| Cost item                             | Monthly cost             |\n|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Labor                                 | 600 EUR /mo              |\n| 125% Cloud costs (estimate)           | 375 EUR /mo              |\n| Domain name                           | 28 EUR/year              |\n| Total (monthly)                       | 977,33 EUR /mo           |\n| Total (bi-annually)                   | 5,864 EUR bi-anually     |\n| Exchange rate KSM/EUR                 | 335.44 EUR (406.645 USD) |\n| Total base price in KSM (bi-annually) | 17.482                   |\n| Slippage + conversion fee 5%          | 0.874                    |\n| Proposal (KSM)                        | 18.356                   |\n```\n\n## Payment conditions\n\n-   to calculate the price, we use Subscan's 30 avg tool at the day of submission:\n    \n\n       -   Polkadot: [https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n    \n     -   Kusama: [https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)\n    \n \n-  Trading-slippage will be taken into account by adding a 5% surplus to the KSM base-price\n    \n-   Proposal should be approved to cover the upcoming 6 months, not the 6 months of work done before.\n    \n-   Work will start upon approval.",

      "content": "Phase 2 of the Validator Resource Center and Ranking Website (VRC) further improves upon the ranking method from Phase 1, by making the scoring model more customizable and thereby better representing the user’s preferences. Also, the VRC score is now a major metric in the manual selection process. Additionally, we include several new metrics (e.g. performance based on historic era data) and thereby reduce the load of information on nominators. A new filtering technique helps to reduce the overall set of validators based on their quantitative properties and make it easier for nominators to make an appropriate selection. We also introduce a staking dashboard, which gives important visual and numerical information about the network.\n\n**This proposal covers the development of milestones 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.**\n\n**Original proposal and context:**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pvmbMMzNAqVzQkoXi_nRS-1wDti2y03X4VqOp9nNTw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pvmbMMzNAqVzQkoXi_nRS-1wDti2y03X4VqOp9nNTw/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n**Link to the Validators Ranking website (new UI and tools):**\n\n[https://validatorsv2.kusama.polkastats.io](https://validatorsv2.kusama.polkastats.io)\n\n**Link to monorepo (backend + frontend):**\n\n[https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2)\n\n## Scope of work for this proposal\n\nThe majority of the work for these milestones has been completed: the team is at the moment finalising details on M10 to continue further development. In Phase 2, we extended previous work and incorporate three major upgrades:\n\nA new manual selection for validators set taking into account custom scoring and a filtering technique to remove quantitatively dominated (undesired) validators from the overall lists.\n\nA dashboard, which makes it easier to cope with the ever changing nature of the network, where today’s selection might not be the right one for a nominator in the future. It shows general information (like number of validators, number of nominators, current era, minimum stake) and graphs with metrics over time: a. Graphs (across time) for: average commission, average self-stake, average performance, average era-points; b. Plot the current selection of validators in the VRC as points (averaged) in the graphs of a); c. Indicate the on-chain nominations (when connected to the polkadot extension) in the graphs of a). Here we can potentially plot two points. One where the nomination was made in the past and another where the current nomination compares to the current state of the network.\n\nA process for nominators to cultivate their on-chain nominations. To do so, we can compare the nominations made in the past to the most recent era and flagging critical events (e.g., commission increases by validators or slashing events) that happened between the time of the validators set election and present time. We can further offer nominators to remove validators who caused critical events from their set and make a renomination of the rest.\n\nA way to feature not elected validators, to incentivize its inclusion in the user’s validator set. A random validator is selected randomly over the inactive validators that had up to 10% commission and at least 20 KSM self stake. The validator is featured 2 weeks in the top of the ranking page and after that period another validator is selected.\n\nThis proposal submission covers the **final part** of the VRC Development:\n\n**Milestone 6: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00**\n\nUser interface implementation II:\n\n- Simple weighted metrics\n- Add charts for performance, rewards, era points and payouts.\n- Integrate 1kVP Validators information\n\n**Milestone 7: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00**\n\nUser interface implementation III:\n\n- Implement dominance filter\n- Feature inactive validators:\n- Feature inactive validators: use next elected information to feature the top 10 inactive validators based on previous phragmen election;\n- Incentivize inclusion of at least one inactive validator in the set;\n\n**Milestone 8: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00**\n\nUser interface implementation IV:\n\n- Dashboard with comparison charts:\n- Current set vs network average performance comparison\n\n**Milestone 9: (1 week) - EUR 0.00 (REMOVED)**\n\t\nTrustless mode:\n\n- The dapp will start in trustless mode (no backend used), you can enable the backend to analyze the full history.\n\n**Milestone 10: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00**\n\nTesting and documentation:\n\n- Final testing\n- Documentation\n- Migrate to production\n\n## Payment conditions:\n\n- One submission per milestone/ 5 milestones per submission (as decided by council)\n- First milestone submitted as agreement for Phase 2 of this project, to start as soon as passed by Council.\n- Subsequent milestones to be paid after delivery.\n- Overall timeline: 5 weeks\n- Total estimation: EUR 4,000.00 / USD 4.846.54 / 12.35 KSM\n- KSM Rate: using monthly average from [https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price)) - 392.346 USD/KSM -  323.81 EUR/KSM.\n- ADDRESS: `FUNseFMiXE3b1iAbfixBLtPNgc1PPWaxhDRpZHrC8sjL4aX` (Mario)\n",

We just launched our beta version of a shared node API Service and are already listed in the Polkadot.js app. This service expands on our core mission - to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.\n\n**This funding grant is for the ongoing running costs of two pools of Kusama nodes for Q2 2021 (April, May, June) - this will be proposed again every three months.**\n- These costs are currently estimated at USD $9,056.34 each quarter\n- In Q1 2021 we served ([see previous proposal report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/65)):\n    - A grand total of 252,483,124 requests over the quarter.\n    - A record 23,686,188 daily requests\n    - A rolling 7 day average at the end of the Q1 period of 2,588,618 requests each day\n- We’ll maintain our free tier for users of 500,000 requests a day. This is so we can maintain and ensure that Kusama is accessible by all, from the largest and most funded development teams, to the many amatuers tinkering away.\n- We’ll maintain the [one click deploy dedicated node](https://onfinality.io/dedicated_nodes) access to Kusama for customers that need more than what our API service is intended for\n- You can access our public API service by creating a [free account for our admin portal](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183), or by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/)\n\n[You can read more about this proposal, including detailed itemised costing here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18_5FU_Xj0JFnPRZrDGpaNHH4poaL-GW1fIU4OwYLruY/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "Cyberfuture on Parachains by bitfwd 比特未来: 15th + 22nd April Name of the event: Cyberfuture on Parachains Medium post: https://medium.com/bitfwd/cyber-future-on-parachains-virtual-event-5f5bac3e78d5 Schedule: 15 & 22 April 2021 Format: Online event Submitting: on behalf of Bitfwd 比特未来 (bitfwd.com) We are preparing the \"Cyber future on Parachains\" online event. We decided to organise this event to educate the community and share the latest development on Polkadot. The event will be run in two parts, 1 per week spread across two consecutive weeks. Leading up to the event we are intending to produce engaging content to be spread across social media. 1st session: DeFi use cases and developer focused component The first session will be focused on Polkadot introduction: General overview and introduction to Acala - a DeFi parachain on Polkadot. This session will aim for introduction into the Polkadot ecosystem for newcomers and beginners and encourage them to get involved as a developer on Polkadot and Kusama, DeFi on Polkadot and data querying on Polkadot and Kusama. 2nd Session Culture, ecosystem building and crypto entrepreneurship in the polkadot ecosystem. The event will be focused on Art on Kusama and Polkadot with speakers that are working on NFT protocols and standards for the Kusama network. This session will aim for Polkadot art in general, NFT minting on Kusama and how it works, on chain standard for custom notes on Kusama protocol (RMRK). We will also share in this session the fascinating business case of how Polkadot became a phenomenal case study of how to grow the global open source ecosystem harnessing the Chinese developer ecosystem that is spread across the world. Proposed Speakers: Our aim is to create content before the event (announcement) and educational content after the event in video and written format. Our Ask: 10k USD in KSM for operation costs: Event planning Content creation before and after the event (video, blogs, visual banners) Promotions in communities About bitfwd 比特未来: Bitfwd 比特未来 (bitfwd.com) is an open source grassroots crypto community that started in Australia since 2015, we’ve been facilitating collaborations between academics, entrepreneurs, advisory to governments (in Australia and New Zealand) and supported numerous startups, including some of the hottest up and coming projects in the Substrate ecosystem: SubQuery, DeepDAO) . We are a Our team is experienced in running events managers, producing content and we are very excited about the developments in the writers that would love to host virtual events about the Polkadot ecosystem as we’ve been following closely since 2017.

      "title": "Validator Resource Center and Ranking Website for Kusama (Phase 2) - Report for milestones 2, 3, 4 and 5",
      "content": "Phase 2 of the Validator Resource Center and Ranking Website (VRC)  further improves upon the ranking method from Phase 1, by making the scoring model more customizable and thereby better representing the user’s preferences. Also, the VRC score is now a major metric in the manual selection process. Additionally, we include several new metrics (e.g. performance based on historic era data) and thereby reduce the load of information on nominators. A new filtering technique helps to reduce the overall set of validators based on their quantitative properties and make it easier for nominators to make an appropriate selection. We also introduce a staking dashboard, which gives important visual and numerical information about the network.\n\nThis proposal covers the development of milestones 2, 3, 4, 5 and includes a report for milestone 1. \n\n### Original proposal for M1 and context:\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pvmbMMzNAqVzQkoXi_nRS-1wDti2y03X4VqOp9nNTw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pvmbMMzNAqVzQkoXi_nRS-1wDti2y03X4VqOp9nNTw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Link to the Validators Ranking website (new UI and tools):\n[https://validatorsv2.kusama.polkastats.io/](https://validatorsv2.kusama.polkastats.io/)\n\n### Link to monorepo (backend + frontend):\n[https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2)\n\n\n### Report for M1 - delivered\n\nPhase I tasks:\n\n- Ryabina feedback improvements\n- Kusama network website integration\n- Dependency upgrades\n- Renting of a dedicated development server for 3 months of development:\n- 46.41€ Heztner setup fee + 3 x 46.41€ = 185,64 €\n\nCompleted tasks:\n\n- Ryabina improvements for V1 was implemented: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center) \n- Lot of dependency upgrades for V1, mainly polkadot-js/api.\n- Integration with Kusama network website was complete including: Klaro integration for cookie management, same header as Kusama network website, footer with privacy policy, terms of use and cookie settings.\n- Small bugfixes and improvements for V1\n- Renting of the Heztner dedicated server for V2 development\n\n\n### Report for M2 - completed\n\nProject kick-off:\n\n- Create and configure project repository: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2) \n- Backend and frontend will use the same repo using yarn workspaces:\n- Backend: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/backend](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/backend)\n- Frontend: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/frontend](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/frontend) \n- Development server (VPS) setup.\n\n\n### Report for M3 - completed\n\nBackend:\n\n- Define backend db schema, with the goal of extracting interesting extrinsics and events to separate tables for faster further analysis: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/blob/develop/backend/docker/backend/sql/backend.sql](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/blob/develop/backend/docker/backend/sql/backend.sql)\n- Develop crawler based on PolkaStats backend: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/backend](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/backend)\n- Implement new metrics\n- Thousand validators program data integration\n\nThe backend has been developed and tested using the Kusama chain. It successfully crawled the entire chain storing blocks, events and extrinsics in the database. That allows us to query long term information like address creation without the need to use an external API. Also the crawler that consolidates the ranking data is live and storing the info in the database, calculating all major and minor metrics and also including Thousand validators program API information.\n\n### Report for M4 - completed\n\nUI/UX design:\n\n- Design pages, components and user interactions\n- Receive feedback from Iggy/team\n- Discuss before implementation to speed up development.\n\nAbout the new UI, we discussed extensively about main flows and user interaction in the proposal elaboration, so we chose to directly implement into the project as mockups to have a clear idea about them. Some elements are functional like exclude and search filter and some others not like auto-filter and custom weighted score (its logic will be implemented in the following milestones).\n\n### Report for M5 - completed\n\nUser interface implementation I:\n\n- Implement new user interface: [https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/frontend](https://github.com/Colm3na/kusama-validator-resource-center-v2/tree/develop/frontend) \n- Migrate logic from polkadot-js to graphQL\n- New performance metrics\n\n\nThe UI logic has already been migrated from polkadot-js/api to GraphQL queries to leverage the new backend and the ranking data is live and fully functional. Some charts have been added to the validator single page like era points, commission and payouts charts. Also we mocked the charts and general layout of the dashboard page, the import page is pretty functional showing extension accounts and their validators sets. The connect to wallet button is also implemented, showing the extension addresses and letting you connect to any of them to use it in the nominate page.\n\n## Scope of work for this proposal\n\nThe majority of the work for these milestones has been completed: the team is at the moment finalising details on M5 to continue further development. In Phase 2, we extended previous work and incorporate three upgrades:\n\n- A new manual selection for validators set taking into account custom scoring and a filtering technique to remove quantitatively dominated (undesired) validators from the overall lists.\n- A dashboard, which makes it easier to cope with the ever changing nature of the network, where today’s selection might not be the right one for a nominator in the future. It shows general information (like number of validators, number of nominators, current era, minimum stake) and graphs with metrics over time: a. Graphs (across time) for: average commission, average self-stake, average performance, average era-points; b. Plot the current selection of validators in the VRC as points (averaged) in the graphs of a); c. Indicate the on-chain nominations (when connected to the polkadot extension) in the graphs of a). Here we can potentially plot two points. One where the nomination was made in the past and another where the current nomination compares to the current state of the network. \n- A process for nominators to cultivate their on-chain nominations. To do so, we can compare the nominations made in the past to the most recent era and flagging critical events (e.g., commission increases by validators or slashing events) that happened between the time of the validators set election and present time. We can further offer nominators to remove validators who caused critical events from their set and make a renomination of the rest.\n\n## Milestones to be covered by this allocation request:\n\n### Milestone 2: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00 / 4.76 KSM\n\nProject kick-off:\n\n- Create and configure project repository.\n- Backend and frontend will use the same repo using yarn workspaces\n- Development server (VPS) setup\n\n### Milestone 3: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00 / 4.76 KSM\n\nBackend:\n\n- Define backend db schema, with the goal of extracting interesting extrinsics and events to separate tables for faster further analysis.\n- Develop crawler based on PolkaStats backend\n- Implement new metrics\n- Thousand validators program data integration\n\n### Milestone 4: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00 / 4.76 KSM\n\nUI/UX design:\n\n- Design pages, components and user interactions\n- Receive feedback from Iggy/team\n- Discuss before implementation to speed up development.\n\n### Milestone 5: (1 week) - EUR 1000.00 / 4.76 KSM\n\nUser interface implementation I:\n\n- Implement new user interface\n- Migrate logic from polkadot-js to graphQL\n- New performance metrics\n\n\n### Development server costs (added to the total allocation of the milestone)\n\nBelow you will find the server renting budget for another 3 months period:\n\n- Dedicated server: 46.41 €\n- TOTAL (1 month): 46.41 €\n- 3 MONTHS PERIOD: 139.23 € - 0.66 KSM\n\n\n## Payment conditions:\n\n- One submission per milestone/ 4 milestones per submission (as decided by council)\n- First milestone submitted as agreement for Phase 2 of this project, to start as soon as passed by Council.\n- Subsequent milestones to be paid after delivery.\n- Overall timeline: 4 weeks\n- Total estimation:  EUR 4139.23 / 19.70 KSM\n- KSM Rate: USD 249.88/KSM (monthly average from [https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price) - 17.03.2021) - EUR 210.04/KSM.\n- ADDRESS: FUNseFMiXE3b1iAbfixBLtPNgc1PPWaxhDRpZHrC8sjL4aX (Mario)",

Ask!'s goal is to provide a set of contract framework and compilation tools using AssemblyScript (aka AS) as the programming language. Contracts written through Ask! can run in the FRAME Contracts Pallet, and eventually can call each other with contracts written by ink!. \n\n## v0.2 main functions\nThis proposal will add the following new features on the basis of v0.1.\n\n### 1. Add spread and packed data storage methods\nIn the v0.1, we have implemented the basic data types `i8`/`u8`, `i16`/`u16`, `i32`/`u32`, `i64`/`u64`, `string`, The save and load function of `bool`, in the v0.2, we will support the save and load of map, array, object and other composite data types. In order to provide flexibility in data storage, but also for storage efficiency on certain scenarios, we will provide two storage methods: `spread` and `packed`.\n\n* `@storage` is specified as a persistent storage class, and it is stored in the way of `spread` by default, that is: the preprocessor will generate a key for each member in the storage class, and then use the hash of this key as the index , save the value of the member variable to the chain, and the saved data value is the original value of the member variable, without compression and other operations;\n* The `packed` method is used to store a member (especially compound members, such as object, map, array) in a packed manner. If a member is designated as a packed member, its sub-members will not continue to expand, but to save and load as a whole. And it will be compressed when saving, and decompressed when loading. The members stored in `packed` method need to be explicitly specified by the developer using the `@packed` annotation.\n\nFor the part of the composite type, the types commonly used in `std` are basically implemented in ink!. As far as Ask! is concerned, this version provides a **complete infrastructure for composite types **, and implements the most commonly used composite types. Therefore, like ink!, the corresponding realization of multiple composite types needs to be gradually supplemented in future versions.\n\n### 2. Add new annotations and extend the supported annotation functions\nThe basic functions of the four annotations `@contract`, `@storage`, `@constructor`, and `@message` have been implemented in the v0.1. In this proposal, their functions will be improved and `@event` annotations will be introduced to support event functions.\n* Introduce `@ignore` and `@packed` for `@storage` class.\n  * The `@ignore` annotation is used to indicate that a particular member variable does not need to be persistently stored. It only saves the set value during one call, and after the call is completed, it is destroyed from memory.\n  * The `@packed` annotation is used to indicate that a member variable is stored in a packed and compressed manner.\n* Introduce parameters `payable`, `mutates`, `selector` for `@message` annotation.\n  * The `payable` parameter is used to indicate whether the message can accept value. The default value is `false`.\n  * The `mutates` parameter is used to indicate whether the message changes the value of the stored data. The default value is `true`.\n  * The `selector` parameter is to specify the selector of the message, that is, if the name of the message is changed, its selector will also use the specified value.\n* Added `@event` and `@topic` annotations to support event functions.\n  * `@event` acts on the class, and the preprocessor will generate the `emit` logic code for this class.\n  * `@topic` acts on the member variables of the event class. The marked member variables will be written into the topic field.\n\n### 3. Add contract inheritance function\nThis function is mainly for the preprocessor to process the inheritance relationship between two classes annotated with `@contract`. AS language itself supports class inheritance, so the main job of the preprocessor is to process `@message`, `@constructor `, `@storage` , these three annotations related to the contract function. Due to class inheritance, the message and constructor methods will be overridden. At this time, the preprocessor determines the call of the `call` entry function based on the actual contract writing assign logic, and generate the content of the corresponding field in metadata.json.\n\nThe function will follow the following principles:\n * The `@constructor` method is mainly based on subclasses. If it is not provided in the subclass, it is ignored. Because the parent class cannot know the member variables in the subclass, it cannot initialize the contract completely.\n * The `@message` method uses the union of all messages in the parent class and the subclass. If an override occurs, the message in the subclass is the main one.\n * `@storage` is not encapsulated, the inheritance relationship is determined by the developer.\n\nink! currently does not have the ability to inherit/reuse contracts, so Ask! has no reference samples, see issue: [https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/625](https://github.com /paritytech/ink/issues/625). In this version, Ask! will implement the corresponding grammatical features of AssemblyScript to simulate the effect of contract inheritance in Solidity.\n\nBecause there is no reference sample in this part, the time-consuming implementation may be biased, the completeness of the implementation cannot be clearly guaranteed, and there may be some edge problems that cannot be handled. In short, this part will be designed with reference to the implementation of Solidity. If this part can be implemented successfully, **the Ask! contract has features that the ink! contract does not have, and this feature is of great significance to the prosperity of the contract ecosystem .**\n\n### 4. Add the function of cross-contract call by specifying @dynamic class\nIn the v0.1 version, we have supported the function of using Abi.ts for cross-contract calls, that is, using the following methods:\n```typescript\n  let data = Abi.encode(\"addFunc\", [new UInt32(1), new UInt32(2)]);\n  let val = this.another.call(data);\n```\nHowever, this method is not conducive to code reuse and maintenance, so the @dynamic annotation is introduced to indicate that a class can be called across contracts.\n\nThe `@dynamic` function is the cornerstone of the definition of contract standards, and is an indispensable function in the contract. Based on this function, the interface can be designed for the contract and the agreement can be made similar to ERC20.\n\n`@dynamic` acts on the class, the class marked as dynamic, the preprocessor will generate remote call logic for each of its methods, developers do not need to write implementation logic for the methods of the dynamic class. The use of dynamic will be as follows The code shows:\n\n```typescript\n// define a class as dynamic\n@dynamic\nclass IERC20 {\n    transfer(from: AccountId, to: AccountId, value: u128): void {}\n}\n\n// use dynamic class.\nlet ksm = new IERC20(new AccountId('0x12345678...'));\nksm.transfer(msg.sender, this.address, msg.value);\n```\nHere we don't use the `interface` keyword, because the interface in AS cannot be a new instance, and the syntax cannot support such an operation.\n\nThe definition of `@dynamic` is similar to the function of `interface` in Solidity. ink! tries to use `#[ink::trait_definition]` to implement this. The current design of this part is very imperfect, and a new design has been proposed recently. For details, please refer to the issue: [https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/631](https://github.com/ paritytech/ink/issues/631). On the other hand, we believe that the current implementation of ink! contains many problems, see issue:[https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/683](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/ issues/683).\n\nThrough the above discussion, it can be seen that this feature needs to be carefully designed and there are also various problems in the current ink! design. Therefore, this function may encounter unexpected problems in practice, so this part may also exceed the expected time in practice. Due to language features, we expect that the implementation of this part should be easier than the implementation of ink!.\n\nOn the other hand, we hope that the contracts written by Ask! and ink! can call each other. Therefore, in this version we will use this function to design simple cases, for example, manually write the corresponding `@dynamic` annotated class for the content of the ink! contract, and test the mutual call. But if the ink! contract needs to be more smoothly combined with the Ask! contract, for example, to provide the function of parsing ink!’s metadata to automatically generate the corresponding `@dynamic` modified `class`, you need to pay a lot of extra work to design according tools.  For example, combine this function with `ask-cli`. These extra workloads are not included in the implementation of this version and will be arranged in subsequent versions.\n\n## Expanded issues in v0.1\n\nIn v0.1, we discussed with Parity team about the type generation part in the contract metadata. The type information of metadata is very useful for third-party applications. Currently, the `scale-info` library is used in ink! as a library for generating contract type information. This library comes from:\n\n* Draft: [https://hackmd.io/0wWm0ueBSF26m2pBG5NaeQ?view](https://hackmd.io/0wWm0ueBSF26m2pBG5NaeQ?view)\n* Original repo: [https://github.com/type-metadata/type-metadata](https://github.com/type-metadata/type-metadata)\n* The latest repo: [https://github.com/paritytech/scale-info]([https://github.com/paritytech/scale-info)\n\n@Robin from the parity team informed that the current scale-info is not mature enough to cover many possible situations, so it cannot be used in the Runtime of Substrate to help the Runtime generate type information in the Runtime (so the polkadot.js api needs developer to provide [Extending types](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api/start/types.extend/)). And `scale-info` is more closely bound to the `rust` syntax, and in many cases it cannot be applied to the type of AS.\n\nTherefore, for the type information part of the contract metadata, we plan to redesign a tool library for AS types and similar in function to `scale-info`. Since this library is for AS, its corresponding third-party parsing part also needs to be implemented. Therefore, corresponding to this library, we need to add corresponding implementations in the SDKs of different languages:\n\n* JS/TS: [@polkadot{.js}](https://github.com/polkadot-js/)\n* Go: Himalia PatractGo: [https://github.com/patractlabs/go-patract](https://github.com/patractlabs/go-patract)\n* Python: Himalia PatractPy: [https://github.com/patractlabs/py-patract](https://github.com/patractlabs/py-patract)\n* Java: Himalia PatractJ: [https://github.com/patractlabs/patractj](https://github.com/patractlabs/patractj)\n* C#: Himalia PatractN: [https://github.com/patractlabs/csharp-patract](https://github.com/patractlabs/csharp-patract)\n\nExcept for polkadot.js, the SDKs of other languages ​​are controlled by Patract, so theoretically, we can finally achieve the type information analysis corresponding to Ask!.\n\nHowever, the workload of implementing this library and the SDK of the corresponding language is huge and cumbersome. On the other hand, the export of type information does not affect the execution of the contract itself.\n\nAt the same time, `scale-info` itself is not mature. ** Therefore, this part will not be planned to be implemented in this version (v0.2), but is planned to be in a later version. **\n\n## Detailed timeline of v0.2 (10 weeks, 15 Mar ~ 24 May)\n* Week 1~3 (3 developers):\n  1.

      "content": "**DeepDAO** is a discovery platform for DAOs and governance systems, centered on analytics and information gathering. Our main dashboard enumerates and ranks DAOs using several key metrics such as membership and assets under management (AUM). We are constantly expanding both coverage of DAOs and the metrics that quantify and measure the dynamics of governance processes in DAOs.\n\nDeepDAO currently reports both financial and governance data on 100+ Top DAOs across five major platforms - Aragon, Moloch, DAOstack, OpenLaw and Colony. All DAOs on our system currently run on Ethereum or xDAI, and we are expanding our coverage to other chains and governance platforms as well. DeepDAO data is being used by major research firms (Delphi Digital, Messari), journalists, VCs, and DAOists across the ecosystem.\n\n**The end goal of this proposal** is to list the Kusama Network (and in the future other Substrate organizations) on web-based platforms that collect data for users (like https://deepdao.io). The Kusama Network will work as a first experimentation approach when deciding how to organise the data collected, and will allow us to understand the mechanisms better.\n\nKusama would be listed together with all the other DAOs on DeepDAO, and potentially other platforms and ranked according to several metrics. Special sections are dedicated to each DAO on these platforms, and include related links, social media, written material, and data aggregation and analysis.\n\n[Link to the full text of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bghiKUiGg47wt2glzzEGxGBy1eYHsCsQWPbhj-NH34U/edit#).",

Milestone 1 has been completed and this is a submission to cover milestone 2!\n\nRotki is an open source portfolio tracker, accounting and analytics tool that respects your privacy. The mission is to bring transparency into both the crypto and traditional financial sectors through the use of open source. Most importantly, unlike virtually every other competing service which consists of closed source webapps onto which you are forced to hand over all your financial data, with Rotki your data is stored encrypted locally in your computer.\n\nMore information on the proposal, timelines & allocations can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OwdIcrAqDxMpDcIRTE7wbJU0aO2gGfZplyEI7s1oWPo/edit?usp=sharing). \n\nSpecifically for Milestone 2 we will:\n\n- Perform transaction history query for the imported addresses by using either the connected KSM node (or an open node if one exists) and show them in the Rotki UI in the blockchain transactions component.\n- Detect if any of the user’s addresses are actively staking, and if yes show how much profit they have made (counting historical KSM prices) and show expected profits in the UI. Also calculate profit for addresses that have staked so far in the past and take it into account in the PnL report for a given period.\n- Add the staking information in the Rotki UI staking component so users can see a break down of staking info per address.\n\n\n",

      "title": "PolkaStats treasury expense proposal - operation costs for Kusama, 17.12.2020 - 17.03.2021",
      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI would like to submit another proposal to cover PolkaStats operation costs for Kusama for the period 17.12.2020 - 17.03.2021.\n\n### MOTIVATION\n\nPolkaStats is a Substrate block explorer aiming to provide the best staking and economic data for both validators and nominators. It helps both types of users by providing comprehensive metrics, charts and utilities to improve their knowledge and performance.\n\nPolkaStats is one of the projects that was born in **La Colmena**, a crypto community based in Sevilla, southern Spain. The community aims to incentivize content-creation in Spanish for Polkadot, Kusama and other blockchain projects and, as supporters of open source culture, develop software to contribute to the ecosystem. The organization also acts like an incubator that helped create blockchain business models like DragonStake or Delega Networks validators.\n\nOne year after starting the project in La Colmena it is certain to say that PolkaStats development also helped us learn and understand more about the Substrate framework and substrate-based chains. \n\nAlthough there are currently already some very good Substrate explorers in the ecosystem, PolkaStats has a different perspective to offer in order to increase diversity among the existing solutions. PolkaStats differentiates from other explorers in:\n\n1. Focusing on Proof of Stake chains only.\n2. Being a Javascript based block explorer (both frontend and backend)\n3. Utilising Vue.js / Nuxt.js frameworks used in frontend, with a low learning curve.\n4. Allowing Incipient wallet functionalities\n\n### SOME KUSAMA METRICS\n\nGoogle Analytics metrics of the Kusama version of PolkaStats in the last month:\n\n- 2.800 unique users\n- 4.500 sessions\n- Visitors from 89 different countries\n\n### PREVIOUS APPROVED PROPOSAL\n\nThe details of the last proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nPrevious proposal discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/290). \n\nLast treasury motion, executed at block #4,086,175 (Sep 17, 2020) :\n\n- [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/47 ](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/47)\n- [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/214 ](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/214)\n\n### SPENDING PROPOSAL FOR PERIOD 17.12.2020 - 17.03.2021\n\nPolkaStats aims to submit this spending proposal in the following terms:\n\n- New **3 month period**, covering operational expenses **from 17.12.2020 to 17.03.2021**, which totals to **6,27 KSM**.\n- KSM conversion rate of 1 KSM = 111.11 $ (92,75 €) using MA(99) AVG from https://www.binance.com/en/trade/KSM_USDT\n- The funds will be used to pay the servers we rent to Hetzer and Digital Ocean in order to operate PolkaStats for Kusama and Westend network (shared with Polkadot).\n\n### FULL PROPOSAL DETAILS\n\nYou can find the full proposal details, including monthly budget [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f_45S8bLzgsJ16yCABoUFxINxlJq1tSmasbSXJYxSNg).\n",

      "title": "OpenSquare's treasury proposal for dotreasury M2",
      "content": "As you may know, we proposed [dotreasury](https://www.dotreasury.com/) and finished our work for M1. Check [post 352](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352) for the proposal discussions and [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#870d76ca-0cf3-4f87-8c94-012fccc939ea) for our M1 report. We hope you like our work and now we are proposing the dotreasury M2.\n\n## Work in M2\n\n### 1. Account system\n- Account registry\n- Login & logout\n- Binding with web3 addresses\n\nIt will be similar with account system of polkassembly.\n\n### 2. Funded projects list and detail page\n\nIt's common that one project have support from several proposals. So it's not enough to just comment on one proposal or tip. We should get to know the funded projects and comment them from a higher view.\n\nIn the detail page, there will be descriptions about:\n- summary of the project\n- what this project have done with the treasury fund\n- how many proposals/tips and in total how many KSMs this project has spent \n- related links\n- remarks to this project\n\nSome consultant work maybe involved for this. I may ask questions to some beneficiaries and councilors.\n\n### 3. Remarks support\n\nMainly in the expense detail pages and project detail pages. Remarks may come from:  \n\n\n1. logined users. If the user has bind address, we will show the address or identity.\n2. anonymous remark. User don't have to login to leave this kind of remarks, but we need to think deeply about it. Maybe we will open it to user after the logined user remarks has been supported.\n\n### 4. Burnt records\n\nOnly burnt records list, no need to show the detail.\n\n### 5. Treasury income distribution\n\nWe will show it like 20% from gas, 30% from slash, etc. Maybe a doughnut chart will be shown.\n\n### 6. Previous work polish\n\nMainly solve problems we mentioned in our [M1 report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#870d76ca-0cf3-4f87-8c94-012fccc939ea).\n\n- We may parse more special extrinsic that wrap tip action.\n- Add more docs and test cases.\n- Add settings for switch nodes.\n\n## Time and cost\n\nCost for M1 can be checked [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#182dea63-f93f-4f66-aa4f-e7a03bb483ab), and the time is a little tight for us.\n\nConsidering our experience of M1 and the upcoming China spring festival, we want to decide the time to be 1.25 months. 3 developers, 1 designer and 1 operation intern will work on this M2, but we will not request cost for the operation intern.\n\nSo the cost list will be:\n- 3 developers and 1 designer: ($6500 * 3 + $4000) \\* 1.25 = $29375\n- Server fee for 2021.01 and 2021.02:  (8vCPU + 16GiB + 500GiB SSD + 10Mbps) * 2 = $800\n- We use MongoDB, but now it's deployed as single instance in our server, it's really unstable. We want a cloud MongoDB for more stable deployment to support upcoming remarks feature, but only from 2021.02. It is $500.\n\nTake KSM price as $70, so the KSM expense: ($29375 + $800 + $500) / $70 = 438KSM\n\nOutput: \n- New features supported in [dotreasury.com](https://www.dotreasury.com/)\n- [Code repo](https://github.com/opensquare-network/dotreasury).\n\n## FAQs\n\n1.  What's your next plans?  \nYou can see our rough milestones [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#182dea63-f93f-4f66-aa4f-e7a03bb483ab). Though there maybe small changes, our final target is to introduce retrospect mechanism to current treasury workflow. In the future, we aim to build a reputation system for treasury participators. Of course, we will do it cautiously.\n\n2. What's your plan to integrate polkadot?  \nOur plan is after M2.\n\nSome other possible questions can still be seen [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/352#182dea63-f93f-4f66-aa4f-e7a03bb483ab).\n\n---\nWe are [OpenSquare](https://www.opensquare.network/) team, dedicated to facilitate the collaboration between projects and developers.",

Geolocation routing that allows us to maximise the use of different pools of nodes across our user base, and allows us to quickly fall over to alternative pools located in different geographic regions in the case that one goes offline\n\n**More Info:**\n- We just served over 17.682 million requests in a single day on the 24th of February 2021 to our free API service (up from 3.2 million on the 6th of January 2021)\n- We’ll maintain our free tier for users of 500,000 requests a day so we can maintain and ensure that Kusama is accessible by all, from the largest and most funded development teams, to the many amateurs tinkering away.\n- In the future, we may provide additional paid tiers of API Service usage above those 500,000 daily requests at different costs structures\n- We’ll maintain the [one click deploy dedicated node](https://onfinality.io/dedicated_nodes) access to Kusama for customers that need more than what our API service is intended for\n- You can access our public API service by [creating a free account for our admin portal](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183), or by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/)\n\n**The previous on-chain application for this was calculated at a previous exchange rate.

      "content": "This is a treasury proposal whose proposer address (Hk4nHNjyw9RqgDZzW79hne33M9iMXWaEik51Cmqb5BNaXz3) \n\n    Season 1 - Kusama\n    Season 2 - Polkadot (comming soon)\n\n**Project Description**\n\nA brief description of the project.\n\nThis proposal aims to recommend strategies to create Kusama tutorials (comics) and promote them on social media. The unique format will help to attract more new potential users to the Polkadot ecosystem, help educate newcomers, enlarge the Polkadot audience, and keep all community members up to date with all news and all education materials in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nAn indication of why this project is good for the ecosystem.\n\nA strong community is indispensable for a healthy digital system. Some even say it is an essential characteristic. However, the web is a prominent place. With so many different platforms and media, it can be hard to keep up with the latest news.\n\nThis proposal centers on publications one visual tutorial (Comics) every two-three weeks. Every comic translates or explains Polkadot’s technical documentation, developments, news.\n\nAn indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.\n\nFirst of all, it is fascinating and brings a lot of fun. Creating something new is always great, and in parallel, we will explain something complicated in simple words.\n\nTeam Member: \nDan - Designer; Alex - Copywriter, SMM manager \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PolkadotComics\n\nTeam's Experience: We have been interested in Polkadot since mid-2019 (Dotcon, Web3 summit). It all started when Gavin Wood introduced us to the project, its vision, and its values at the web3 conference in Berlin. From the first day we knew - we wanted to contribute to the project from our communications background; since that time, we plan to focus on creative solutions for increasing awareness. We ended up creating the Polkadot Comic, a visual guide to Polkadot. - https://twitter.com/PolkadotComics\n\nProposal submitted by Dan (@geek_block on Riot and Telegram.) I have over 3+ years of experience in the blockchain and crypto industry and early crypto investors. As of 2018, I have been actively developing an SMM agency, together with a team of marketing specialists, advertising, and PR managers who are related to the cryptocurrency market. Besides this, I was a UI/UX designer for 5+ years. I have experience working in different spheres (from IT and Blockchain to Pharma industries): presentation design, graphic design, infographics, UI/UX, user research, customer analysis, prototyping. Have a sense of style, composition, form, and color.\n\n**Budget**\n\nPer 1 comic\n\n    Research: 3 man-hours ($10 per hour); $30\n    Scripting and Storyboarding: 5 man-hours ($10 per hour); $50\n    Digital and illustration design (Original illustrations that was not used before): 13 man-hours ($30 per hour); $390\n    Additional content and Customization for SMM: 2 man-hour ($20 per hour); $40\n    Time: 23 man-hours\n    Budget: $510\n\n**Development Roadmap**\n\n    Total Estimated Duration: 12-14 weeks\n    Total Costs: $3060\n\nWe plan to create original sets of illustrations for each comic, it will be developed by us and will be open source.\n\n**Milestone 1**\n\n    Estimated duration: 6-7 weeks\n    Costs: $1530\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/76ZjjcTx/20-39-04.png)\n\n**Milestone 2**\n\n    Estimated duration: 6-7 weeks\n    Costs: $1530\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/SNcq6B65/20-39-13.png)\n\n**Summary**\n\n    Total Budget USDT: 3060\n    Total Budget KSM: 50 (1 KSM = $61,2 - 30 day avr.)\n    Total Estimated Duration: 12-14 weeks\n    KSM Address:Hk4nHNjyw9RqgDZzW79hne33M9iMXWaEik51Cmqb5BNaXz3\n\nAdditional Information Between weekly comics publications, we plan to publish a variety of information directly related to the Polkadot blockchain.

      "content": "**Phase 2 of the Validator Resource Center and Ranking Website (VRC)** further improves upon the ranking method from Phase 1, by making the scoring model more customizable and thereby better representing the user’s preferences. Also, the VRC score is now a major metric in the manual selection process. Additionally, we include several new metrics (e.g. performance based on historic era data) and thereby reduce the load of information on nominators. **A new filtering technique** helps to reduce the overall set of validators based on their quantitative properties and make it easier for nominators to make an appropriate selection.\n\nAside from that, Phase 2 introduces a **staking dashboard**, which gives important visual and numerical information about the network, allowing comparisons of sets to the state of the network. It will be even possible to import your current nominations (via the polkadot.js extension) and check whether some critical events happened to nominated validators (e.g., an increase of commission or a slash).\n\n**Code-of-conduct for the implementation**\n\n- We are aware that this project bears a large responsibility towards nominators and validators. Therefore, every decision on this implementation follows these principles as much as possible:\n- Act in the interest of the network as much as possible.\n- Act in the interest of the nominator whenever possible.\n- Objectivity on validators selection as much as possible. Don't discriminate against individual validators.\n- We value user preferences and try to give them as much freedom as possible while maintaining the trade-off with usability.\n\nYou can review the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14pvmbMMzNAqVzQkoXi_nRS-1wDti2y03X4VqOp9nNTw/edit?usp=sharing).

      "title": "KodaDot NFT explorer",
      "content": "**Short Description**: This project will extend [KodaDot](https://kodadot.js.org/) (rewrite original [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/) in [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/)) with an NFT explorer. The NFT explorer main idea is to incorporate the workflow of exploring, issuing, querying and sending NFTs between users. Our idea is wrapped around the possibility and accessibility, to easily create a marketplace for anyone who is non-technically savvy to be able to use it from a mobile device.\n\n**[Original proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17hN0Xakc5ie-GlPRBydUSSrXFngo_6fg-LT9EcVmgao/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n## \n**1. Context of the proposal**\n\nThe goal of this project is to create a universal NFT explorer and marketplace interface later for non-fungible tokens on Kusama. With the final outcome of this proposal, users will be able to mint, transfer, and burn NFTs on the network. On top of this, transfer functionality will be extended with buy and sell features, which will be later translated into a marketplace. We are looking to filter options for galleries to be curated and anyone to participate.\n\nOur primary deliverable will be an extension of KodaDot: an NFT explorer as open source library for future NFT pallets operators to use.\n\nThe team would like to embrace various properties of ownership and rental manipulation for various use-cases, not just art. ERC-1155 (i.e batch operations of ERC-20 and ERC-721), ERC-1633 (timeshares, co-ownership, fractional ownership), ERC994 (delegation), ERC-998(composable NFT), ERC-809(renting), ERC-1201(tokenize ownership and rental rights) and in future cover this integrations in our NFT explorer.\n\n## \n**2. Problem statement**\n\n[Unique Network](https://github.com/usetech-llc/) or [RMRK.app](http://rmrk.app/) proposed solutions to mint NFTs, however, there is little to no UX right now to mint, transfer, filter, list and trade NFTs inside the original interface.\n\nAlthough a PoC gallery is being developed as part of the [NFT Strategy for Kusama, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hflIRKG207uuWkE13lZbFBaf6f4qF_3uvsctNoZFH0o/) having a user-friendly interface will allow a simpler onboarding process for non-tech savvy users into the world of non-fungible assets.\n\n\n## \n**3. Functional objectives**\n\n*   User is able to view, manage and operate non-fungible assets;\n*   Create components allowing upcoming Substrate pallet provider to easily adopt KodaDOT: NFT Explorer;\n*   Users would be able to explore and interact with assets in AR/VR world\n*   Future-compatible open-source library front-end library.\n*   Attract new user base to Kusama ecosystem through AR/VR functionality [[1]](https://twitter.com/FeiStrife/status/1335404817821339656)\n*   Experiment over new usages of NFTs applications, i.e. bundle scene as NFT\n\n## \n**6.

      "title": "Patract Hub's proposal for Ask! v0.1 (ink! in AssemblyScript)",
      "content": "Originally discussed in https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/398\n![image](https://patract.network/images/patract-ask.png)\nAsk! is a smart contract language designed based on AssemblyScript and running on Substrate FRAME Contracts. Ask! uses the similar way to ink! of designing the procedural macro in the form of eDSL, to write contracts by providing annotation type in AssemblyScript (aka AS). This way can hide the implementation details of the contract, and reduces the difficulty of writing contract. Ask! will be similar to ink!’s existing implementation, and the final product will maintain maximum compatibility with ink!’s existing standards. The WASM and metadata files compiled by Ask! can be deployed on the Substrate chain and run normally. \n\n> For example:\n> ink! describe the contract's external call interface through `#[ink(constructor)]`, `#[ink(message)]`.\n>\n> In Ask!, it will describe the interface through `@constructor`, `@action` or other similar annotation.\n\nAS uses the `asc compiler` to compile TypeScript (TS) files into WebAssembly bytecode. However, asc is a general-purpose compilation tool, which cannot directly compile TS files into WASM bytecode and metadata information with smart contract structure. Although AS is only a subset of TS, there are a wide range of developers who use TS as a development language, so the cost of learning AS for these developers is very low. Therefore, we think the Ask! project has a very good application development prospect. Compared with Rust-based ink!, we believe that AS-based Ask! can effectively lower the threshold for contract developers and enrich the contract development ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to relying on the asc compiler, Ask! does not rely on other open source libraries or projects. In the existing projects that use AS as the smart contract development language, there are no mature projects that can be used, and the basic libraries that can be used are not perfect. The current existing approximate implementations are:\n\n* [ParityTech's AS-Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/as-substrate). The most recent commit of this project is 5 months ago, and it has not kept up with the current changes in FRAME Contracts and ink!. And in the implementation of `AS-Substrate`, it is not compatible with the existing standard described by ink!. On the other hand, `AS-Substrate` has not designed syntactic sugar, annotations or other tools like ink!'s eDSL, and it cannot generate metadata or similar files.\n* [Slickup's SubScript](https://github.com/slickup/subscript). This project received a W3F Grant, but since the Grant was approved, it has not been implemented much, and the degree of completion is much lower than that of `AS-Substrate`. Its connection to FRAME Contracts [host_api](https://github.com/slickup/subscript/blob/master/core/assembly/env/host_api.ts) is still for the interface before refactoring.\n\n[Patract Hub](https://patract.io) develops local open source toolkits and one-stop cloud smart IDE, committed to provide free development toolkits and infrastructure services for the entire WASM smart contract ecosystem. We have launched 7 projects in Polkadot/Kusama Treasury, and Ask! will be our 8th project. The Github repo is https://github.com/patractlabs/ask.\n\n**FYI: the detailed tech design blow had been provided to the core team from Parity ink! and updated based on their suggestions**\n\n## Design\n\nAsk! will provide `Contract Framework` (referred to as `Framework` in the following description) and `Contract PreProcessor` (referred to as `PreProcessor` in the following description) two compontents. Besides, we will also provide a supporting tool named as ask-cli (similar to the [`cargo-contracts`](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract) of ink!), for helping setting up and managing WASM smart contracts written in Ask!.\n\ntheir functions are defined as follows:\n\n* `Framework`'s main function is to provide high-level packaging for the on-chain API, and then provide the specification for writing contracts through annotation types. It needs to complete the following tasks:\n   * Define annotation-based contract writing specifications\n   * Define the description specification of the contract interface in metadata\n   * Encapsulate the details of the data interaction between the contract and the chain, such as the definition of the key generation rule in the contract storage and the reading and writing of the storage\n   * Encapsulate functional components on the chain, such as `Balance`, `AccountId`, `Block`, `Crypto`, etc.\n   * Compile the AS contract into WASM code based on the semantics of the contract, and contains the link symbol for the interaction interface with FRAME Contracts.\n* `PreProcessor`'s main function is to parse the annotations defined in the `Framework`, and generate corresponding logic codes for these annotations; according to the contract interface specifications in the Framework, generate metadata files. `PreProcessor` needs to complete the following tasks:\n   * Parse the annotations in the contract and generate the corresponding logic code\n   * Parse contract interfaces and parameters, and generate metadata files\n   * Parse the custom contract grammar (syntactic sugar), and generate the corresponding logic code\n   * Automatic storage and loading of data\n* `ask-cli`'s main function is to manage the Ask! project in cli mode, which includes the following functions:\n    * Create Ask! contract template.\n    * Simplify the Ask! project compilation process, hide the details of the preprocessing and compilation process.\n    * Manage the version dependencies of Framework, PreProcessor and Compiler.\n    * Check the legality of the generated WASM code.\n\nIn addition, in order to facilitate developers to develop contracts through AS, Patract Hub will continue the following works:\n\n* Add Ask! support in the our [Metis](https://github.com/patractlabs/metis) smart contract library, such as SafeMath.\n* Provide common contract examples consistent with ink!'s example directory, such as ERC20, ERC721 contracts, etc.\n\n## The future development plans of Ask!\n\n### v0.1（10 weeks）Define specifications of contract writing and contract method description; encapsulate on-chain interactive API and functional components\n\n**Framework**\n* Define contract writing specifications, define contract annotations and the logical functions corresponding to each annotation.\n* Encapsulate the interface defined in the `define_env!` macro in the contract module.\n* Design and implement the storage layout of metadata, which can read and write metadata.\n* Implement map/array type storage layout design, which can read and write map/array types.\n* Encapsulate `AccountId`, `Balance`, `Block`, `Crypto` functional components and other env types.\n\n**PreProcessor**\n* Design program structures, annotation parsing method and workflow.\n* Parse and generate logic codes for main annotations (@contract, @storage, @message).\n* Generate metadata automatic loading and automatic storage logic code.\n* Generate metadata files with complete structure.\n\n**What the product needs to achieve**\n* Contracts written in Ask! can be deployed and executed on Substrate\n\n### v0.2 (10 weeks) Finish all the functions of Framework and PreProcessor; provide toolset and sample code.\n\n**Framework**\n* Provide fully packaged functional components\n* Joint testing and optimization.\n* Provide assistance tools.\n* Provide examples of commonly used contracts, improve the usage documents, and provide release versions.\n\n**PreProcessor**\n* Support parsing all annotations and syntactic sugar to generate corresponding logic codes.\n* Support the generation of logic codes for automatic storage and loading of composite data types.\n* Optimize the compilation process to improve compilation efficiency.\n* Improve the accuracy and readability of error messages\n* Continue to follow up on Substrate changes\n\n**What the product needs to achieve**\n\nWe will try our best to make full compatibility of the generation rules for storage key and message (selector), as well as all structure encoding, with the existing designs of ink!, so that we can make Ask! and ink! contracts calling each other.\n\n### v0.3 (TBD) Finish ask-cli and provide further improvement\n\n**ask-cli**\n* Finish the functions of ask-cli to create, compile, and check code legality for contracts\n\n**Ask!**\n* Sorting out and refactoring the codebase\n* Add corresponding functions according to the progress of ink!\n* Improve Ask! to become a mature technology that can be used normally at the production level\n\n## Detailed timeline of v0.1 (10 weeks，14 Dec ~ 22 Feb）\n\n* The 1st and 2nd weeks (3 developers)\n  1. Define the contract structure of the contract files, the definition of the contract method, and the type of contract method parameters.\n  2. Define the data structure of storage: Determine the serialization and deserialization methods of each data item in the storage class.\n  3.

      "content": "OnFinality is a SaaS platform providing infrastructure services for the Kusama/Substrate community. We just launched our beta version of a shared node API Service and are already listed in the Polkadot.js app. This service expands on our core mission - to support all blockchain developers in the world by providing core infrastructure so they can focus on building the next dApp.\n\nSetting up blockchain infrastructure is difficult and time consuming, and requires a level of server development expertise that many don’t have. We're applying for funding for the ongoing costs of our free public API service for Kusama so that everyone can access a public pool of managed Kusama nodes.\n\n**This funding grant is for the ongoing running costs of this pool of Kusama nodes for Q1 2021 (January/February/March) - this will be proposed again every three months. These costs are currently estimated at USD $1,189.2 a month**\n\n**More Info**\n- We just served over 3.2 million requests in a single day on the 6th of January 2021 to our free API service\n- There is an additional separate funding grant for improvements to the API service that further scale the service. [The details of this future grant are here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/431).\n- We’ll maintain our free tier for users of 500,000 requests a day while funds to run these nodes remain. This is so we can maintain and ensure that Kusama is accessible by all, from the largest and most funded development teams, to the many amateurs tinkering away.\n- In the future, we may provide additional paid tiers of API Service usage above those 500,000 daily requests at different costs structures\n- We’ll maintain the [one click deploy dedicated node](https://onfinality.io/dedicated_nodes) access to Kusama for customers that need more than what our API service is intended for\n- You can access our public API service by[ creating a free account for our admin portal](https://support.onfinality.io/hc/en-us/articles/900004222183), or by connecting to it using [Polkadot.js](https://polkadot.js.org/)\n\nYou can read more on this treasury funding proposal at [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBjbjR0HhQ_RuEqceu69_jvJbFaAzqF7Cf9xMry2RZY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBjbjR0HhQ_RuEqceu69_jvJbFaAzqF7Cf9xMry2RZY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can also read about our funding proposal for the improvements to the scalability of our service [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/431).\n\nAdditionally, you can talk to us on Telegram at [t.me/onfinality](t.me/onfinality)",

      "title": "\"Virtual Niche\" - The World's First Crypto Art Exhibition with Kusama Network",
      "content": "**Presentation of the Exhibition**\n\n[BCA x KUSAMA Exhibition .pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-x_GCHJ8wtVeuZ6xm49VMoQe4wEE2DBm/view)\n\nWe are in preparation for the world's first and largest offline Crypto Art Group Exhibition \"Virtual Niche\" in two prominent Art Institutions: [UCCA Labs](https://ucca.org.cn/en/lab/) Beijing and Shanghai [JinArt Gallery](http://www.jinart.com.cn/), from 26th March - 11th April 2021.\n\nThe 14 days dual city exhibition is designed to feature Kusama Network and aims to create awareness of its cryptoart capability among the targeted artists group, with the goal of onboarding them to Kusama Network for cryptoart adoption through workshops and a Kusama Network Theme Crypto Art creation competition. Furthermore these events will introduce the art world to the development of Blockchain culture from Bitcoin and Ethereum to Polkadot/Kusama artwork via storytelling curation and workshops.\n\nGiven the high profile of these events, we propose they be used as a Grand Opening for the Kusama Network art gallery. Each of the participants will receive a special crypto ticket on Kusama Network as a part of a tech immersive creation experience. From the current pipeline we are looking to showcase:\n\n1. Kusama Network [ORMLcrypto pallet](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/nft) and Art Gallery\n2. [PolkadotAssetJS](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/55)\n3. [RMRK.app](https://rmrk.app/)\n4. [Unique Network](https://usetech.com/usetech-announces-unique-network-nft-chain-on-substrate/)\n\nIn Shanghai, a one-day offline cryptoart summit will be hosted prior to the Shanghai exhibition opening to gather the key participants of Tech+Art , Gaming, e-Sport, Streetwear and Blockchain. Kusama Network will be the highlight.\n\n**The Problems We Try to Solve:**\n\n1. The Cryptoart industry in general is suffering from the demand for high quality artists/ artwork and lack of efficient (non-crypto) buyers.\n2. Kusama Network is also a new decentralized network brand in the marketplace for crypto artists that needs to prompt its capabilities after the kick off of the cryptoart Strategy.\n3. Cryptoart and blockchain are new concepts for non-crypto background artists in general, and most of them need to understand the rationale behind it and process to create new pieces.\n\n**Opportunities:**\n\n1. Traditional galleries are not incentivized to promote digital artists due to the lack of technical tools to manage digital editions. While digital Art collectors are unsatisfied with USBs and other tools for file delivery. Galleries and digital Art collectors will be attracted to the cryptoart market if a user friendly solution is developed to help them enlarge sales and client base.\n2. We see the potential for onboarding a new generation of young artists with coding capabilities (artists that create crypto art who is also crypto savvy), generative artists (the group of artist that use AI/ algorithms as creation tool eg. [Mario Klingeman](http://quasimondo.com/)) and more traditional Artists (digital artists who create art in digital forms, eg. [Digiway](https://www.instagram.com/digiway/?hl=en)).\n3. The Kusama Network community needs events that help enlarge its art community around and the tools being developed for them and their creations. This is a good opportunity for a first kick-off in this direction.\n\n**The Proposal: \"Virtual Niche\" Exhibition**\n\nThe project is divided into 4 milestones. The ultimate vision is to brand all cryptoart in the Chinese community first as a genre of contemporary art, opening the door to interested market collectors.\n\nA List of confirmed renowned artists to join the group exhibition and workshop with Kusama Network\n\n* Christiet's First NFT Art Portrait of Mind [Ben Gentill](https://www.robertalice.com/)\n* A Generative AI Video of [Mario Klingeman](http://quasimondo.com/) provided a private collector\n* [Dabeiyuzhou](https://www.behance.net/dabeiyuzhou)\n* [Sun Yuan & Peng Yu](http://www.sunyuanpengyu.com/works/all.html);[ Guggenheim Exhibition](https://www.guggenheim.org/teaching-materials/teaching-modern-and-contemporary-asian-art/sun-yuan-%E5%AD%99-%E5%8E%9F-and-peng-yu-%E5%BD%AD-%E7%A6%B9)\n* [REVA](https://twitter.com/Reva_fyw)\n* [Liu Jiaying](https://news.artron.net/20200629/n1080743.html)\n* [Tian Xiaolei ](http://www.tianxiaolei.cn/); [Exhibition and Art Review](https://www.artforum.com/picks/museum-of-contemporary-art-shanghai-moca-shanghai-66767)\n* [RICHARD GILLMAN](https://misterdg.wixsite.com/portfolio) ；[superrare market place](https://superrare.co/misterdg29620)\n* [Alida Sun ](https://alidasun.tumblr.com/); [interview](https://themethod.in/life-on-the-internet-from-nowhere-and-everywhere/)\n* [Water Tian](http://watertian.com/)\n\n\n**Milestone 1: Kusama Theme Crypto Art Creation Competition**\n\nTo Build up the Kusama artist community for organic cryptoart on-boarding.

      "content": "### Context of the proposal\n\n[After successfully delivering support for Polkadot in Ramp's SDK](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/37#476c5add-3741-4381-b1b2-f399a8527cbf), Ramp team wants to add another asset to the list - KSM. \n\nThe idea of building a functional canary network to test the particularly innovative solutions is something that has been long missing in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As for Polkadot, good on-ramping is important for Kusama as well and should be included in the building process from day one. Following the research Ramp team did while integrating Polkadot, we are convinced we have the necessary skills and know-how to quickly add support for KSM.\n\n### Problem\n\nWe see the Kusama ecosystem developing, but for usage numbers to come, easy access for new users must be ensured. Currently, the first-time user willing to enter the ecosystem must enter either via centralised exchange. These steps are bearable for the current users of the network and crypto-natives, but will be a huge obstacle to new participants.\n\nTo significantly improve the process for the end-user, networks need on-ramps for easy, streamlined access using fiat money.\n\n### Solution\n\nHere enters Ramp. With Ramp the purchase process takes place in just one interface, it is directly correlated to the wallet user is using for the purchase and, usually, takes much less time and requires fewer data than centralised exchanges need.\n\nRamp offers a powerful SDK that allows developers to offer KSM purchases with cards, bank transfers and open banking within their apps. This means that Kusma powered solutions requiring KSM to use wouldn't need to ask new users to leave the app to complete the purchase. Think of it as Stripe for crypto onboarding.\n\nWith Ramp, we want to provide KSM users and developers with a battle-tested alternative to a centralised exchange: an on-ramp that easy to implement and delightful to use. It will shorten the onboarding process from a few days to a few minutes which will contribute to the overall development of the Kusama ecosystem.\n\n### Proposal\n\nWe'd like however to help the ecosystem to grow and thus ask the treasury to participate in upfront costs to lower our risk and allow us to proceed promptly and integrate before the ecosystem reaches billions in real-life usage volume. We adjusted the cost and work estimation so that the overlapping parts are not included twice - both the technical integration and the legal assessment have been proportionally decreased and discounted. \n\n**You can review full proposal here**: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ksfQnat8jmwdLb-H_fJ3zxM9JoiVCFLCM3O9tTaPDZ4/edit?usp=sharing",

      "content": "This is copy from https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/370\n\n## Summary\n\nAt present, Substrate has a large number of client SDKs of different languages to interact with the blockchains. However, these client SDKs are oriented to the Substrate-based chain, so the functions provided by them are often limited to the APIs and primitive under the Substrate framework. All of these client SDKs do not support smart contracts.\n\nIn the Polkadot ecosystem, not all parachains need to include smart contracts support. In most cases, Runtime can already solve most certain application scenarios. Therefore, the client SDKs for Substrate does not have to support smart contracts. On the other hand, based on the principle of minimization, this type of smart contract SDKs should be developed in the form of an independent library. This is the development goal of Himalia.\n\nA smart contract-based DApp not only needs to develop the contract on the chain, but also needs to develop user-oriented front-end interfaces and micro-services, which means that developers need to interact with contracts from different terminals and based on multiple development languages. \n\n**Himalia will provide FRAME Contracts SDK supports in a multi-language environment to support WASM DApp development**. Himalia will be [Patract Hub](https://patract.io)'s 7th project for whole WASM contract development support. DApp needs to choose different technology stacks based on its form. For example, a service that provides users with contract status queries is often developed based on Golang, and a contract-based blockchain game can be developed in C# based on game engines such as Unity3D. This means that to expand the application scenarios of DApp, we need SDKs in as many environments as possible. Currently Himalia plans to implement SDK support for the following languages:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2844215/100198842-5e7eb100-2f37-11eb-8c06-292bf4b52d3b.png)\n\n* v0.1(3 weeks): [PatractGo](https://github.com/patractlabs/go-patract), Golang contract SDK, to support micro-service development based on contract status. PatractGo will be based on [Centrifuge's GSRPC](https://github.com/centrifuge/go-substrate-rpc-client), which has already support Substract 2.0.\n* v0.2(2 weeks): [PatractPy](https://github.com/patractlabs/py-patract), Python contract SDK, to support the development of scripts interacting with contracts, including automated scripts to support testing. PatractPy will be based on [Polkascan's Python Substrate Interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface), which has already support Substract 2.0.\n* v0.3(4 weeks): [PatractJ](https://github.com/patractlabs/patractj), Java/Scala/Kotlin contract SDK, to support back-end development based on JVM, and also rely on [Emeraldpay's PolkaJ](https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj) to complete the support development for Substrate 2.0.\n* v0.4(3 weeks): [PatractN](https://github.com/patractlabs/csharp-patract), C# contract SDK, to support applications based on DotNet/Mono development and contract interaction, especially game development based on Unity3D, also rely on [Darkfriend77's SubstrateNetApi](https://github.com/darkfriend77/SubstrateNetApi) or [Usetech's polkadot_api_dotnet](https://github.com/usetech-llc/polkadot_api_dotnet) to complete the support development for Substrate 2.0. \n\n## v0.1 for PatractGo \n\n**`PatractGo` is a Golang contract SDK. In addition to supporting the basic interactive API with the contract, it mainly supports the development of micro-services based on the contract status.** For example, for common ERC20 contracts, a service can be developed based on PatractGo to synchronize all transfer information to the database, and based on the database to implement the statistics and processing of transfer data. In addition, developers can also develop some command-line tools based on Golang to assist in testing and debugging. We will be independent of GSRPC and encapsulate the API provided by GSRPC , to adapt to different substrate-based chains.\n\n### Introduction\n\nMost contract behaviors are highly related to context. In addition to interacting with the chain, user-oriented contract applications also need to provide users with current relevant context status information:\n\n```\n+--DAPP-Front-End--------------+        +---Chain-------------------------+\n|                              |        |                                 |\n| +----+  +------------------+ |        | +-------+     +-------+         |\n| |    |  |                  | | Commit | |       |     |       |         |\n| |    |  |   Polkadot-JS    +------------> Node  +---->+ Node  |         |\n| |    +->+                  | |   Tx   | |       |     |       |         |\n| |    |  |                  | |        | +-------+     +----+-++         |\n| |    |  +------------------+ |        |                    ^ |          |\n| | UI |                       |        +---------------------------------+\n| |    |  +------------------+ |                             | |\n| |    |  |                  | |        +--DAPP-Server--------------------+\n| |    |  |                  | |  Push  | +--------+     +-----v-------+  |\n| |    +<-+   Model          +<-----------+        +-----+             |  |\n| |    |  |                  | |        | | Server |     |  PatractGo  |  |\n| |    |  |                  +------------>        +-----+             |  |\n| +----+  +------------------+ | Query  | +----+---+     +-----+-------+  |\n+------------------------------+        |      |               |          |\n                                        |      |         +-----v-------+  |\n                                        |      |         |             |  |\n                                        |      +-------->+   DataBase  |  |\n                                        |                |             |  |\n                                        |                +-------------+  |\n                                        |                                 |\n                                        +---------------------------------+\n```\n\nPatractGo is mainly responsible for implementing micro-services in a DApp. Unlike querying the state of the chain API, PatractGo can monitor the calls and events generated by the specified contract. Developers can obtain the state storage based on this information to maintain consistent state with the chain. Through data services based on a typical API-DB architecture, the front-end DApp can efficiently and concisely obtain the state on the chain as context information.\n\nBased on the API of chain nodes, PatractGo obtains block information and summarizes and filters it, and sends contract-related messages and events based on metadata analysis to the handler protocol specified by the developer. For example, for a typical ERC20 contract, the developer can use the channel to subscribe to all transfer events that occur, and then synchronize them into the database, so that other microservices can provide services corresponding to the token data of the account, such as querying the current token holding distribution and other logics.\n\nTherefor, PatractGo will achieve the following support:\n\n* Complete the secondary packaging of the contract module interface, complete operations such as `put_code`, `call`, `instantiate`, etc.\n* Parse the metadata.json information of the contract, and support the automatic generation of http service interface for the metadata corresponding contract\n* Scanning and monitoring support of the contract status on the chain for statistics and analysis\n* Basic command line tool support for native interaction with the contract, mainly used to test the security of the contract\n* SDK development examples for ERC20 contract support\n\n### Design\n\nPatractGo consists of the following packages:\n\n* `patractgo/metadata` contract metadata processing, and metadata-based contract processing\n* `patractgo/rpc/native` re-encapsulation of the contract module interface to provide the contract-related interaction based on chain RPC\n* `patractgo/rpc` implement the interaction with the contract based on metadata\n* `patractgo/rest` implements an http service based on metadata to interact with the contract\n* `patractgo/scanner` Scanning support for contract status on chain\n* `patractgo/observer` Monitoring support for contract status on the chain\n* `patractgo/contracts/erc20` supports ERC20 contracts\n* `patractgo/cmd/patractgo` a command line tool for interacting with contracts\n* `patractgo/cmd/pdumper` monitors contract status and events and synchronizes them to the database\n* `patractgo/examples` SDK instance\n\n## v0.2 for PatractPy\n\n**`PatractPy` is a contract SDK to support the development of Python scripts that interact with contracts, including automated scripts to support testing.** Unlike PatractGo, PatractPy is mainly for script development, so PatractPy mainly completes contract-related RPC interfaces, and completes contract deployment and instantiation-related operations. At the same time, PatractPy will implement PatractGo-based interaction and contract status monitoring support.\n\nAs a result, PatractPy will achieve the following support:\n\n* Complete the secondary packaging of the contract module interface, complete operations such as `put_code`, `call`, `instantiate`, etc.\n* Contract-based metadata information and contract interaction\n* Based on `PatractGo`, provide HTTP service for contract-based metadata information and contract interaction\n* Based on `PatractGo`, provide Scanning and monitoring support for contract to do statistics and analysis\n* Provide a SDK development example for ERC20 contract\n\n## Detailed timeline for v0.1 ~ v0.2  (5 weeks, 1 Dec ~ 5 Jan)\n\n### M1: v0.1 PatractGo（2 developers * 3 weeks)\n\n* Initialize the project and complete the native contract interaction API\n* Complete the contract interaction API and HTTP contract interaction service based on metadata.json\n* Complete contract status scan support\n* Monitor service support and complete the example to write into the database\n* Complete ERC20 contract support and complete the corresponding command line tools\n* Improve sample code and unboxing documentation\n\n### M2: v0.2 PatractPy (2 developers * 2 weeks)\n\n* Initialize the project and complete the native contract interaction API\n* Complete the contract interaction API based on metadata.json\n* Through `PatractGo`, complete the contract interaction API based on metadata.json\n* Through `PatractGo`, complete the monitoring service support, and complete the example to write into the database\n* Complete ERC20 contract support\n* Improve sample code and unboxing documentation\n\n### M3&M4: v0.3&v0.4, PatractJ & PatractN.\n\nWe have finished the design for the Java and .NET SDK, but because the chain SDK teams hasn't completed the Substrate 2.0 support , so we may need to wait for them to finish it and apply later, so the timeline maybe uncertain.\n\n## Cost of v0.1 & 0.2 (10 developers * weeks)\n\n* Operating activities: $2000 ( Rent and Devices: $200 per developer * week )\n* Employee payments: $19000 ($1900 per developer * week)\n* —————————— +\n* Total Cost: $21000\n* Exchange Rate: $45 / KSM\n* Treasury Proposal: 466 KSM\n\n## Verification of v0.1: Report & Github Source & Jupiter and Canvas testnet:\n\n* Through unit test cases, based on Docker and verify all interactive APIs\n* Through unit test cases, all contract events and calls can be synchronized and written to the log and database through the monitoring service\n* Provide sample code for RPC package and Observer package, based on the README document, you can complete the test environment and debug the sample code\n\n## Verification of v0.2: Report & Github Source & Jupiter and Canvas testnet:\n\n* Through unit test cases, based on Docker and http service to verify all interactive APIs\n* Provide sample code, based on the README document, you can complete the test environment and debug the sample code",

      "content": "**Treasury proposal: SubBooster, an open source remote compiling tool for Substrate developers.**\n\n**EXPLANATION**: Previously we were thinking about submit a treasury spending proposal for each milestone. But we made a mistake when submitting the proposal that the spending is the sum of milestone1 and milestone2. It seems the only way we can do is to submit both milestones in this proposal. We're sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nWe've been working on this project for a few months, from an early idea to a functional MVP (https://github.com/sub-box/SubBox), which could now deliver a pretty good experience. We expect to add more automatic features and Kusama/Polkadot integration with the founding from treasury. By the way, it is really cool to compile a Substrate based project within 4.5 minutes.\n\nWe really want to gain your understanding and support to help us complete the project!\n\n> The original and detail discussion post:https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/335 \n\n### Project short description:\nWe are introducing an open source remote compiling speed up tool which is named SubBooster to Kusama and Polkadot community. \n\nBy using the remote compiling service, developers and learners within the eco could compile their projects in a more efficient way that enable them to do it within 4.5 minutes.\n\nWe also integrate some other functions like onchain identity to this service to create more use cases for the network. \n\n### **How to benefit our community?**\n\n* It helps to save much time for Substrate developers, boost their project and lower the threshold  for new comers to Substrate dev community.\n* It will create more use cases for important features such as onchain identify/vote to improve the value of Kusama/Polkadot network\n* We are expecting 200 common users after milestone1, and 500 users after milestone2 along with acceptable user experience.\n\n### Technical roadmap\n\n- Milestone 1: backend service automation and onchain integration;(2 months)\n- Milestone 2: Feature complete and user onboarding;(2 months)\n- Post Milestone 2: Regular server health check and monitor; (2 months)\n\n### Milestone 1: backend service automation and onchain integration.(2 months)\n\nTasks:\n\n* scripts to deploy and manage the compiling server;\n* a web service can save the information provided by the user;\n* a scheduled task to register new user in compiling server;\n* detail documentation on how to use this compiling service;\n* start onboarding users manually to 100 users.\n* Kusama/Polkadot onchain identity integration;\n* Integrate polkadot js extension to sign message;\n* Backend service verify the message and apply user to compiling server;\n* Automatically onboarding 200 users;\n\nAfter the 1st month, early users should be able to submit a form with user and public key information and enjoy the compiling service within 10 mins, without manual operation;\n\nAfter the 2nd month, users can register the web app with Kusama/Polkadot account and sign a message to prove that they are eligible to use the compiling service.\n\n### Milestone 2: Feature complete and user onboarding\n\nTasks:\n\n* benchmark how many users can be supported in single server;\n* scripts to scale up compiling servers;\n* add promote code logic for students and new comers;\n* implement cancellation of service based on the above mentioned rules;\n* consulting 3rd party to finalize terms of service.\n* Tech support.\n\nAfter this milestone, users should be able to apply and cancel free compiling service based on their onchain identity/vote. We also plan to help students who don't have enough ksm to register onchain identity.\n\nNot only Substrate devs, we will also try to reach out Rust community, and provide guidance docs and online communication through Discord, Telegram, Wechat, etc. To ensure more people make best use of this tool.\n\n### Post Milestone 2: Regular server health check and monitor\n\nWhen we've completed the milestone 1 and 2, we'll keep to provide service for another 2 more months. And after this 2 months, we will try to be keep it alive as a public infrastructure through another proposal with a minimal server cost. \n\n### Treasury request: \n\nWe have 2 developers and 1 part time community manager devote to this project. According the task in the technical map, we've made a [budget in detail.] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ckMMUDzGKf7QGjv3sKBmHGN6daNktb_KhJgA6Ozf0uU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n### Info and contact\n\n[Kevin](https://github.com/gbt1988): no4long@gmail.com\n\n[Popeye](https://github.com/popeye-rs): popeye-rs@163.com\n\nGithub: https://github.com/sub-box/sub-box\n",

Within the scope of this proposal and (Milestone 1) we will create a visual NFT gallery where users will be able to view their collectibles, metadatas associated with tokens, in a visual manner. The tool will be provided open source so anyone will be able to create their own gallery.\n\nPolkadotAssetJS is designed to be extendable to easily integrate new substrate asset pallets. In the scope of this project, PolkadotAssetJS plans to follow Kusama NFT development plan to constantly adapt to most relevant pallets or available technologies. The first milestone covers the RMRK protocol in order to deploy NFT capabilities as soon as possible. Future milestones will integrate new pallets and tools as they develop, such as ORML pallet, Unique, and smart contract based tokens.\nBut the compatibility might be adapted to the most relevant pallets depending on the level of maturity and adoption in Kusama.\n\nMain delivery is a web application allowing to view Art and Collectibles available on a Kusama wallet in a visual manner. The app will be able to display NFT balances as well as NFT transaction history, using RMRK.app tokens. EverdreamSoft will issue some collectible images as an example and connect available collections.\n\nAlong with the web application EverdreamSoft will provide an open source library allowing any developer to display RMRK tokens and display their own NFT curated collections and balances.\n\nThe library is written in Typescript and uses PolkadotJS as a dependency. The library uses an abstract architecture for token definition allowing to easily implement new NFT pallets while keeping the same code workflow.\n\nRead the full proposal here : [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eNgiT9hVt8itBgr1mK57SzbyOgU7TMOPb-_0-XzIwQE/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Deliverable**\n\nMain delivery is a web application allowing to view Art and Collectibles available on a Kusama wallet in a visual manner.

      "content": "\nThis is the first milestone of \"Robots Waiting for Kusama\" proposal. \n\nThe initial post is here: https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/297. The detailed document is avaliable on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jnnlEmOayiFt3bAajsXa3a3qbAKEWbSA7P0Oup-NhmU).\n\nThe purpose of the proposal is to demonstrate current capabilities of Kusama network for robotics technicians working or studying at universities by presentation of already available web3 tools. A large-scale demonstration with colleagues from partner universities will be conducted for this, in which various robots will function, being integrated in a test environment using the Robonomics parachain. The proposal is divided into 5 milestones with 10 robotic devices each + the last milestone for final montage and summing up.\n\nThe first milestone includes:\n- Negotiations with universities about robotic devices for demonstration (10 devices for this milestone).\n- Coordination and technical support of participating university members.\n- Preparation devices and the formation of deliverables.\n\nFor each robot the following will be done:\n- analysis of the ROS-module of the device, correcting the module if necessary, testing the module;\n- robot activation;\n- collection and sending of telemetry data;\n- preparation of results: creating video, documenting a repository, posting a report.\n\nFor the first milestone, we are asking for 850 KSM, which will be used to prepare robotic devices (80 KSM per 1 device) + 50 KSM for operational costs. The milestone will take approximately 12 weeks to complete.\n\nThis is a treasury proposal whose proposer address (HqnKDzYBnFpGH5jXYZmUFXFnz76ynKN6nTh3De3oRxA9gYu) is shown in on-chain info below.

The website, to eventually live on https://kusama.network/ as subpage, aims to provide quantitative and qualitative data about validators’ performance and help nominators to choose the best nomination set that works for them.\n\nThe development of this project has 2 phases: we would appreciate your feedback and comments on it. A member of the Kusama Dev Team, Mario (the mind behind https://polkastats.io/) wishes to implement this once everything is defined and the work will be complemented with @Jonas from W3F, @will from Parity and my feedback. \n\n\nYou can find a full explanation of the project [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y7RVrAbDxl1z-qpG4kKvK-4Lj7zAK2Oc/view?usp=sharing).

      "title": "PolkaStats hardware operational costs treasury expense proposal",
      "content": "Hi all, I would like to open the discussion for a possible new recurring spending proposal: PolkaStats aims submit periodic spending proposals to the Kusama Treasury to fund hardware operational costs. PolkaStats is a Substrate block explorer aiming to provide the best staking and economic data for both validators and nominators. It helps both types of users by providing comprehensive metrics, charts and utilities to improve their knowledge and performance. PolkaStats is one of the projects that was born in La Colmena, a crypto community based in Sevilla, southern Spain. The community aims to incentivize content-creation in Spanish for Polkadot, Kusama and other blockchain projects and, as supporters of open source culture, develop software to contribute to the ecosystem. The organization also acts like an incubator that helped create blockchain business models like DragonStake or Delega Networks validators. Although there are currently already some very good Substrate explorers in the ecosystem, PolkaStats has a different perspective to offer in order to increase diversity among the existing solutions. PolkaStats differentiates from other explorers in: Focusing on Proof of Stake chains only. Being a Javascript based block explorer (both frontend and backend) Utilising Vue.js / Nuxt.js frameworks used in frontend, with a low learning curve. Allowing Incipient wallet functionalities You can find all details of the proposal (including a detailed monthly budget and roadmap for the next 7 months) here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJIyyyl2Asr8tX05zpO-sUOa2aSoeIlCGag030t0vrA/edit?usp=sharing",

      "content": "We propose to develop a council-governed Wiki in Kusama capable of\nstoring content such as subjective agreements, guidelines for treasury management,\nonboarding information, hashes, and links to official software releases, branding material,\nand other important information. The Wiki can only be updated on-chain and by the\ncouncil.\n\nThe work to be done consists on integrating our existing technology for on-chain GIT-like content management within Kusama blockchain. \n\nThe work will take 10 weeks of development and we have budgeted a cost of 17.5k USD. After this, the Wiki will be available to be used by the council and Kusama's community in general.\n\n**This proposal corresponds to the first payment of 20% (3.5k USD at 7.5 USD/KSM) of the total amount** and it will cover the work until the first milestone is delivered. Two other payments, of 32% and 48%, are planed after that intermediate milestone and the final one are delivered, correspondingly. \n\n[You can read the full proposal here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p__nY_Y8rt7nKzQqhiAxYqoBKxpvzn91/view?usp=sharing)\n\nThis proposal was first shared as a discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/166). Thanks to @JAM @Julien, @Raul, @Thibaut and @ThomIvy for their help and support.\n\n*About us:*\n\nI'm [Pepo](https://github.com/pepoospina), the co-founder of [The Underscore Protocol](https://www.uprtcl.io/), a protocol inspired in GIT, but adapted to work with ideas instead of code.

New Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DpSEm3YlKVwRqiGymk1LooB3sck9RBXqN2rkVR\\_p6Wo/edit?usp=sharing Demo with M1 completed: https://nomination.usetech.com/#/Nomination New ppt: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SO1-Sf-mvGwOZfgzDC70WVDfBx212lHZclWfSk\\_EPHo/edit?usp=sharing Code: https://github.com/usetech-llc/apps/tree/staking-clear Worthwhile to note that M1 and M2 form the original proposal have been implemented in M1 of this one. Original: We are building new Nomination scenarios for beginners and then for advanced strategies. This presentation describes the problem and a proposed solution: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14etktaIFTQBLNqW684qUj-6hhH59-GBJR-827WGDbBg/edit?usp=sharing. This is the spec for the first two milestones: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eh-QtleAVe38IPb-tfjgv8Rlu4ANCrJld\\_SMMoyIxAQ/edit?usp=sharing. The first Treasury Proposal (#19) is for Milestone 1, which is completed and reviewed by Jaco with plenty of feedback. We already fixed some of the issues raised, and plan to fix the remainder mostly during the Milestone 2. The resulting solution (upon Milestone 2) will be working as a stand alone solution. Our initial plan to integrate this solution with Apps UI has changed, as discussed in the Riot channel. While Milestones 1 and 2 are not to be changed by this pivot, further long term vision is, so we are designing a new architecture, oriented towards the specific user groups (\"grandma\"), and enabling integration by wallets. This proposal was first presented in the Kusama Direction Riot Channel on April 10, receiving a soft approval from a number of Council Members.",

      "content": "Hello everyone! My name is Jorge Ruiz, I lead the Air Protocol team. We want to share with you our proposal for the creation of localKSM. LocalKSM is will be an implementation of the Air Protocol to create a P2P exchange focused on KSM tokens. The project will consist of an app for iOS and Android that enables users anywhere to list proposals for selling or buying KSM at a rate they specify and with a payment method of their choice. Our team has worked on developing a protocol for the creation of decentralized p2p markets and on/off ramps. The protocol itself is blockchain agnostic and we want to develop and implementation to support KSM as well as release the apps. This implementation would also be able to support DOTs in the future, as long as the MultiSig implementations are rollout onto polkadot. I previously co-founded airtm(dot)com a platform for digital p2p dollars. Through it we enabled hundreds of thousands of users in LatAm to receive remittances and save their money in a stable currency. I left Airtm to create the Air Protocol, which is the result of my experience there. It is clear to us the great reach p2p have and we believe it is an essential step to further the ability of people to have access to better services and join the coming digital economy. We would love to hear feedback from the community, both to see if anyone has put effort towards something like this before? And also to understand if there is interest on this implementation and applications. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts! Our team is very enthusiastic about Polkadot and Kusama (and in general substrate). We are planning on developing the second phase of our project with the use of substrate. As part of extending the capabilities of the Air Protocol we will be developing the Air Protocol chain which will serve as a stateful layer for our system, our intention is creating that chain as a Parachain on polkadot.

      "title": "On chain treasury proposal - Non-custodial P2P trading for KSM",
      "content": "Polkadot and Kusama are innovative projects with exciting ambitions. As it stands the ecosystem is extremely friendly to developers, and on a technical basis alone will be of interest to many end-users of cryptocurrency.\n\nHowever, end-users of cryptocurrency typically have vastly different technical abilities to developers, and this is often a large barrier to entry standing between many projects and mainstream adoption/awareness. A typical end-user will struggle with the basic installation and operation of wallet software, and will not practice the basic security principles involved in properly securing private keys. As technical developers working in the blockchain sphere we often take for granted our own knowledge base, and lose awareness of the gap between providing the best technology, and making that technology accessible to the mainstream. Developer engagement is a critically important tenant of a crypto ecosystem, but it is equally essential we provide as many straightforward and simple on-ramps as possible to allow non-technical end-users to also participate.\n\nLocalCoinSwap’s mission is to bridge the gap between technology and accessibility, by providing a trivially simple ebay-like system in which end users can purchase cryptocurrency directly from each other. We use decentralized technology such as non-custodial wallets and multi-sig transactions or smart-contract based escrow to protect traders from fraud or hacking, but as much as possible we abstract the need to understand the underlying technology from the non-technical end-user. Because of this, we have been especially successful in driving adoption in developing regions of the world who have limited access to traditional exchanges, and rely on other non-standard methods to enter the cryptocurrency ecosystem such as cash purchases, SMS-based payment systems, and gift-card trading. Although the UK and Australian markets constitute the majority of our volume, we are seeing large upticks across Latin America and Africa.\n\nAs part of this proposal, LocalCoinSwap will provide a platform where users can buy and sell KSM, and in the future DOT, for any local fiat currency - in every region of the world. To do this, we will extend our P2P cryptocurrency exchange (localcoinswap.com) to support non-custodial wallets and trading for these assets. Given the non-custodial nature of this implementation, there will be no platform risk with only users having access to their own private keys, no political risk as we cannot seize users funds, and a high level of anonymity for users entering and exiting the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.\n\nAs a project focused on creating low barriers to entry for flexible, autonomous economies, we strongly believe that a decentralized fiat on-ramp is essential for the adoption of Polkadot. Without this, users will likely have to transact through other cryptocurrencies in order to own and use KSM/DOT. As aforementioned, the non-technical end user typically finds the need to purchase intermediate cryptocurrencies an insurmountable barrier.\n\nUpon successful completion we will provide a platform for anyone to buy or sell KSM in a secure and user-friendly manner, without any high-level technical skills. In addition, we will provide the opportunity for users to create vendor businesses in order to make money through providing liquidity, and buying and selling KSM.\n\nWe are interested in building this project as we are excited about creating mainstream accessibility to the next generation of blockchain applications.\n\n\nThe detailed proposal can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m_lBnw6zrkW980zkZhHEJ_Ny6eEUAJk9ey0GSmevleU/edit# ",
