      "content": "I am asking for a tip for my merged subxt pull request \"Support loading keys from Polkadot-JS accounts\". https://github.com/paritytech/subxt/pull/1661 It is very common for users to create their Polkadot accounts using the Polkadot-JS browser extension. Subxt is the primary library for implementing Rust programs that sign and submit extrinsics for Polkadot chains, but it did not support this popular account file format. I examined the Polkadot-JS source code to determine the encoding. The password is hashed with Scrypt and then the ciphertext is decrypted with XSalsa20Poly1305. I would greatly appreciate a tip of 32 KSM. Is this reasonable?",

Think of it as a decentralised talent engine that starts by listening to those who know the industry best—you.\n\nWe’re currently recruiting Web3 freelance developers active in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to join us for early user journey interviews. Your insights will help us design intuitive UX flows tailored to real dev needs and workflows in this space.\n\n📆 Interviews will run from April 7 to April 11.\n\n💰You’ll be compensated with 4 KSM for a 45–60 minute call.\n\nIf you are a Web3 developer excited to shape the future of decentralised work and co-create with us from day 1, [apply here](https://blocksurvey.io/polkatalent-developer-ux-journey-u2jumdYtQ0W7nV3a574B2g?v=o) before April 7.\n\nLet’s build something incredible, together.",

Payouts for community validators\n2. Clearing submission and decision deposits on Kusama and its fellowship counterpart\n\nThe funding is expected to last approximately 4 months given validator payees growth from 168 (current) to 200.\n\nA few related notes:\n- The scripts used for clearing Kusama's submission deposits require updating after one of the previous runtime upgrade.  This should be completed within the next week.\n- Efforts are made to reduce flooding of payouts at the end of an era\n- I've worked on [a branch](https://github.com/turboflakes/crunch/tree/payout_adjustments) to support \"grouped payouts\" on Crunch. \n\nThe public is welcomed to examine the accounts [transaction history](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Gch4VxQ79WhjgQqHomvJbqF3Woza5g5cYgM8SVQdDb9szz1).\n\nKind Regards,\nWill | Paradox",

          "content": "Hey Everyone,\n\n_**UPDATE:**_  We decided to go down the big tipper track to keep things simple. See [comment](../post/2600#jhMYwkbfxhpPu7PHt7sD)\n\nSam Elamin from Imbue. We have been very busy since receiving funding from the treasury and have shipped almost all our milestones  \n  \nOne thing we did notice over the past few months has been the tension around treasury spending. We think Imbue is set up perfectly to solve issues around accountability and funding and have built out the Imbue [grants](https://www.imbue.network/blogs/imbue-grants) \n\nWe also did a live demo of it on [AAG](https://twitter.com/thekusamarian/status/1693704945717870736?s=46&t=zgh35N80b7sSgM--juphNw) with our chain on Rococo\n\nWhat we want to do next is do a demo of what this process looks like on Kusama. \n\nThe goal of the demo is to showcase refunds going back into the treasury \n\nWe will be launching a grant for 10 KSM with 2 milestones\n\n1) Milestone 1 for 1 KSM (10%). This will get approved  \n2) Milestone 2 for 9 KSM. This will get refunded \n\nWe have 4 approvers lined up\n\n1) Giles, an engineer @ parity and part of the fellowship  \n2) Daniel from Parity and part of the SBP\n\nThe remaining 2 are from the Imbue team themselves, but if there is someone who would like to be involved in this demo then please do get in touch\n\nA demo like this should ideally be going through the small/big tipper track but that is not currently possible because the treasury — currently - does not support XCM transfers, so as an interim solution we can use the utility pallet \\`dispatchAs\\` to do a reserve asset transfer from the treasury account to the grant escrow address \n\nWhile initially this needs to go through root because only root has rights to sign transactions on behalf of the treasury.\n\nHowever, we believe the treasury _should_ support xcm transfers going through the different treasury tracks, this demo will be further evidence of that need \n\nBefore we launch the proposal we thought it best to raise a discussion to gauge interest in funding proposals/bounties this way, through milestones and approvers\n\nWe strongly believe this is the best way to ensure accountability and transparency while still remaining flexible enough to support different curators for different grants/projects\n\nKusama was meant for expermintation and to drive innovation, and this is a perfect example of this.\n\nImbue grants was built to solve a key community need, as such we would love your feedback on both this proposed demo as well as how we can best serve the community's requirements",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nHaving met the requirements for onboarding as a proposal auditor as a sequel to Referendum #67's [extension](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RcWEpT5C1u4dNUH4EWCaJfpQ4qOGV19AMXPwj8qSWeY/edit#), I'm opening up my onboarding proposal for community discussions.\n\nThe discussion post for this referendum can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2548)\n\n## Context\n\nTo decentralize and improve the auditing process, it was proposed to extend **Referendum 67** by onboarding new members with the necessary skills and experience to become auditors.\n\nAs a candidate seeking to join the auditor team, I have demonstrated my auditing skills by conducting ten (10) thorough audits, showcasing my ability to assess the quality of treasury proposals objectively. Details of these audits can be found in [Table 1 of this proposal's document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PeGpwRv0gBTklsEpihJvvFMGXog2MmPUIPKzUgKKikM/edit#bookmark=kix.c22cdf9jhuud)\n\n**Getting onboarded as an auditor is the primary aim of this proposal, but the KSM value that will be tipped on this proposal is a token of gratitude for the audit work done so far. (At a rate of 1KSM/audit for a total of 10 audits, details of which are in the proposal document)**\n\nDetails of the proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PeGpwRv0gBTklsEpihJvvFMGXog2MmPUIPKzUgKKikM/edit#). \n\nThank you!",

To test the use of batch statements to issue rewards\n3. Fund [an account](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/Gch4VxQ79WhjgQqHomvJbqF3Woza5g5cYgM8SVQdDb9szz1?tab=extrinsic) used for public validator payouts as a `finder's fee` (2 KSM)\n\nThe main recipient of funding from this tip is Adam Steebar for compiling and maintaining [details related to Open Governance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DHgjfaV0bvYVlsQswEM0EltuYnpYl7GJdg24H-sFpiM/edit#gid=663805148) with recent runtime releases.  He has also engaged in discussion on github relating to same [here ](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6398)and [here](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/6409).  Despite the outcome I appreciate that he applied his Economics skill set to aid the community.\n\nAdditionally, I am taking an opportunity to test batch calls for issuing tips.  In the previous governance model the system required a single primary recipient of tip funding, this test allows for a split of tips among different parties.  If this executes successfully it establishes a model for future payments requiring such action.\n\nFinally, I am directing 20% of this 'Tip' to an account used by a public staking reward payout bot.  This fee is the equivalent of the now debunked finder's fee of the old governance while awarding the recipient the maximum of what would have been a small tip.  \n\nI look forward to a successful test.\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n\n",
