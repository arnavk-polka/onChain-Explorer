      "userId": 26513,
      "network": "polkadot",
      "content": "This is a symbolic treasury proposal that aims to gather community sentiment regarding a brand-new direction for Polkadot's Ethereum-compatibility layer. It's similar to the expensive referendum track of Wish for Change but only for a specific project (and not the whole network, therefore justifying a lower decision deposit). Due to this being an alternative approach compared with the direction that Parity is currently working on, we first would want to gather some serious opinions from voters, and therefore we think it's important to put this into coin voting to understand how things stand. If passed, beginning in September, we would then start a small treasury proposal for detailed initial work that will likely cost 30k-60k USDC.\n\nThis proposal will not replace Parity's Ethereum-compatibility approach that is scheduled on Polkadot Hub (AssetHub), but it's an alternative approach to it. The aim is to avoid the security concerns of Parity's proposal, and to avoid splitting the ecosystem (Polkadot Hub vs. Moonbeam / Acala EVM).\n\nTo do this, we aim to utilize the existing work of [revmc](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/revmc) from Paradigm that compiles EVM bytecode to LLVM, and then target that to PolkaVM. We build the full stack on the [existing full Ethereum-compatibility solution of Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier). This will result in comparable performance with Parity's *revive* Ethereum-compatibility layer, without the drawbacks described below. This brand-new direction will be a **full-compatibility** solution, compared with *revive*'s **almost-compatibility** solution.\n\nWith this proposal, we also make sure existing Polkadot parachains are not left behind. As most current Ethereum-compatibility projects uses Frontier in one way or another, this brand-new direction will also be easily deployable to parachains like Moonbeam and Acala.\n\n## Background\n\n### The many Ethereum-compatibility layers of Polkadot\n\nEthereum-compatibility on Polkadot has long been in existance. This older project is called [Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier). The on-chain component of `pallet-evm` and `pallet-ethereum` contain an EVM interpreter that executes EVM bytecode in a full-compatible way. An off-chain component provides compatibility for RPCs. The project has been used in productions for a long time. Current parachains, like Moonbeam and Acala EVM, either directly use Frontier or heavily modify it to suit their own needs. However, as Ethereum-compatibility was not Polkadot's focus, the project was always on the sideline.\n\nIn the past two years, the direction of Polkadot's smart contract platform has pivoted, and it was decided that Ethereum-compatibility is one of the main focus. Parity then starts to work on a new Ethereum-compatibility layer. The new architecture is named *revive*. It consists of an on-chain runtime *pallet-revive*, the unmodified Solidity compiler *solc* that compiles Solidity source code to YUL intermediate language, and the *resolc* compiler that compiles YUL to PolkaVM bytecodes. The new architecture is still in development but is expected to launch later this year according to the public roadmap.\n\n### Security in focus\n\nWe must not forget why we were on a different direction in the first place and why the choice of Ethereum/EVM was not popular among Polkadot developers. Solidity and EVM were designed in the very early days of the blockchain history. They are, unfortunately, not well designed, and we should not underestimate the security implications of this. As an example, Parity itself was under [a massive hack](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/on-the-parity-wallet-multisig-hack-405a8c12e8f7) that resulted loss of over 150k ETH (30m USD at that time), directly affecting Polkadot presales. Not to mention all the specification surprises, unnoticed issues till the last minutes that even delayed Ethereum hard forks, as well as some of the more massive hacks (for example, theDAO). All those contributed to Parity's eventual discontinuation of its Parity Ethereum client and disengagement with the Ethereum ecosystem. The unsafety of Solidity and EVM was one of the important reasons why ink/Rust was used for smart contract.\n\nAt this moment we're deciding to move back to Ethereum, but we must not forget our expensive past lessons. Embracing Ethereum-compatibility means that security is again on high alert.\n\n### The importance of a security-principled approach\n\nIt's in the author's opinion that revive, Parity's planned Ethereum-compatibility approach, [has safety concerns](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/almost-compatibility-is-unsafe/12990).\n\n*revive* uses an \"almost-compatibility\" approach. The aim is to be able to compile the majority of Solidity source code unmodified, as to encourage users to migrate from Ethereum to Polkadot. Due to the fact that PolkaVM and EVM are different as well as the design differences of *revive*, the compiler has a large number of [documented differences](https://contracts.polkadot.io/revive_compiler/differences_yul_translation) compared with Ethereum.\n\nBeing able to compile Solidity source code unmodified to PolkaVM sounds nice on surface. However, as the author has argued in the above section, embracing Ethereum-compatibility means that security must be on high alert. EVM/Ethereum/Solidity is a subtle target, the Javascript of Web3. The problem of them does not often come from lack of security audits -- it's a multi-billion network and the code base often receives sufficient scrutiny. The problem often comes because it makes it easy for users to write unsafe code. Most of the common pitfalls on Ethereum are already well-documented after this many years. However, we're making the same mistake in Polkadot as the early day Ethereum. The codebase of *revive* can always be audited, but the way users write code on it cannot be fully anticipated in advance. This makes it difficult for even the most experienced security auditors to investigate the consequences of those differences and also how they will interact with existing known pitfalls on Ethereum.\n\nThis makes *revive*'s position of being an \"almost-compatibility\" system, not \"full-compatibility\", not \"some-compatibility\", slightly awkward. Some code changes are still occasionally required. Code audits must be redone.\n\nHaving those differences also make fuzz testing impossible. For a full-compatibility solution, one can always test all possible cases against another existing implementation until it reaches 100%. However, for an almost-compatibility solution, there will always be a large number of test cases failing attributed to the \"known differences\".\n\nThe essence of the problem is a lack of security-principled approach. The objective is set prematurely (compiling Solidity source code unmodified without a full consideration of what means \"unmodified\"), and also without a detailed call for review with the ecosystem shareholders and a full look at the desired user experiences.\n\n### A split of the ecosystem\n\nThe approach of *revive* also splits Polkadot's Ethereum-compatibility ecosystem into two. The existing parachains like Moonbeam use Frontier. The vast difference in approach makes it difficult for them to adopt or migrate to take advantage of the performance of PolkaVM. We are making Ethereum-compatibility an important focus, but in the mean time we're abandoning \"Polkadot-compatibility\".\n\n### A step back of the strategy\n\nAs with everyone else in the Polkadot community, it's also in the author's hope that the new *revive* Ethereum-compatibility layer can bring a massive inflow of dapp developers to Polkadot. But we also must consider the possibility if this won't be the case and prepare accordingly.\n\nFor example, Ethereum core devs, till today, still have the belief that the VM performance is not the main bottleneck. This belief is supported by the benchmarking work of Reth who used EVM-to-LLVM compiler to sync mainnet, and found only 10% performance improvements. In the future, as we have more performance-critical contracts, this may change, but because the dapp developers we attract will come from Ethereum, they may continue to be relauntent. The contract size compiling down to PolkaVM, compared with compiling down to EVM, will be significantly larger. In addition, we're so far not the only chain that has adopted RISC-V in production, and dapps developers may get attracted to them compared with us.\n\nWhether or not our Ethereum-compatibility strategy delivers good results, the bottom line is that our strategy shouldn't hurt us, and it's in the author's opinion that we should never have security as the trade-off. A high-value hack on *revive*, regardless if we later decide it's purely the dapp developers' fault, is sufficient to kill all the momentum we have built up for PolkaVM, and gives us the label of being another unsafe smart contract platform. We shouldn't let that happen. We shouldn't trade security with performance.\n\nIn any case, it's important that we don't rush things. Once smart contracts are deployed, they become immutable. A rushed, but failed deployment is worse than delayed deployment. Whatever our methods are, we should ensure that it won't potentially do harm to Polkadot -- at least we shouldn't expose ourselves to an even more messy situation than Ethereum.\n\n## Design\n\nSo here enters an alternative approach compared with revive.\n\n*revive* uses a compiler stack as follows: Solidity -> YUL -> PolkaVM -> *pallet-revive*. The new approach in this project uses the compiler stack as follows: Solidity -> EVM -> PolkaVM -> Frontier. The Solidity pipeline becomes entirely unaltered. We compile native Solidity to native EVM bytecode. We then hook up the `revmc` project from Paradigm, which is an EVM-to-LLVM recompiler that has successfully synced Ethereum mainnet. This then gives us PolkaVM bytecodes, which is fed into Frontier and use the existing full-compatible system calls.\n\n### EVM alongside PolkaVM\n\nIn this proposal, we will have EVM alongside PolkaVM. Frontier will still have its EVM interpreter and EVM bytecode will still be interpreted. Alongside with that, a native PolkaVM executor is deployed. This means that we can support all \"fallback\" cases and still remain full-compatible. Contract creation can either deploy PolkaVM directly (via a new transaction type) or it can still emit EVM bytecode and Frontier will handle everything just fine.\n\nThis allows for incremental speed-up that takes into considerations of existing Ethereum smart contracts already on Polkadot. An offchain compiler allows users to compile new contracts from EVM bytecode to PolkaVM and then deploy on-chain with native PolkaVM performance. If something is not possible, there is always the EVM interpreter as fallback.\n\n### Code introspection\n\nThe main pain point for anything that is not EVM bytecode is code introspection. Because only new contracts will be deployed on-chain in PolkaVM, the issue of code introspection is solvable -- we simply disallow code introspection in the EVM -> PolkaVM compiler. As also discussed in the last section, for any deployed PolkaVM contract, we still allow it to emit EVM bytecode when necessary, and in this case we still have the EVM interpreter in Frontier for all fallback cases.\n\n### EOF (EVM Object Format)\n\nIn this proposal, we anticipate that we'll likely heavily utilize EOF (EVM Object Format). This is a major upgrade on Ethereum that resolves many of the pain points of the existing EVM format. In particular, dynamic jumps are disabled. Bytecode is split into code sections. And code and gas introspection may be disabled. Many important features for EOF support is already well implemented in the toolchains. It's simply that EOF has not yet been deployed in Ethereum mainnet.\n\nBy utilizing EOF and compiling EVM to PolkaVM, we will accomplish really close to native speed. Compared with Parity's *revive*, the goal is also to take possible future Ethereum upgrades into account, but not working on an \"independent\" solution that will become obsolete in the next few years due to further Ethereum development.\n\n### Gas metering and system calls\n\nWe utilize PolkaVM native gas metering solution, with certain precautions taken as not to break existing EVM/Solidity invariants.\n\nAll system calls are handled by the existing Frontier implementation with production-ready Ethereum compatibility.\n\n## Discussions\n\nThe goal of this Ethereum-compatibility proposal is to bring a new **full-compatibility** solution built on Frontier instead of Parity *revive*'s **almost-compatibility** solution. We also want to make sure the solution, while accomplishing better performance utilizing PolkaVM, does not alienate existing Polkadot ecosystem players like Moonbeam and Acala EVM.\n\n## Impact\n\nIf this proposal passes, we'll work on a more detailed specification with a treasury proposal in the amount of 30k-60k USDC for the initial work going in the new direction with clearly defined deliverables.\n\n## Our vision: an ecosystem that does not work against itself\n\nThe *revive* project is argubly a project built at the expense of its own ecosystem. No matter whether it fulfills the goal of attracting developers from the Ethereum community, one thing is certain -- it will compete with existing parachains like Moonbeam and Acala EVM.\n\nIn addition, *revive*'s choice of \"almost compatibility\" is unfortunately in an awkward spot. Dapp projects must nonetheless be adopted specifically for PolkaVM. Solidity code changes are sometimes needed. Security audits must be redone. And even if a project manages to avoid all of that, the dependencies and build scripts must still be changed.\n\nWe therefore have a real risk of an internal split of Polkadot's own ecosystem between Moonbeam/Acala's Ethereum-compatibility and Polkadot Hub's Ethereum-compatibility. This proposal aims to at least partially consolidate that, and brings a viable, and also arguably better solution for everyone, not just for Polkadot Hub.\n\n## About\n\nWei Tang has been deeply involved in Ethereum core dev. He is the author of EIP-2200 as well as several other protocol specifications that are deployed in Ethereum mainnet. He maintains `rust-evm`, a Rust Ethereum Virtual Machine implementation. He is also the author and maintainer of Frontier, the current Ethereum-compatibility layer for Polkadot that is used in production by many Polkadot parachains.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Have you tried proposing this alternative design to Parity?\n\nUnfortunately due to office politics, this was never possible while the author worked in Parity. Discussions have been sought over the year. On May 19, the author posted in the Polkadot Forum his opinion that [almost-compatibility is unsafe](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/almost-compatibility-is-unsafe/12990). 9 days later on May 28, the author received Parity's letter for termination of employment.\n\n### Who is the contact person if I have additional questions but would like to discuss privately?\n\nPlease contact Wei Tang (wei@bitarray.dev).",

      "content": "As the title suggests, this proposal aims to address two things:\n\nFirst, curators were automatically unassigned from several active bounties due to missed expiry extensions. Unfortunately, this opened the door for an anonymous account to step in and manually unassign curators with trollish remarks (see: https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/26285556-2, https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/26273900-3, https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/26180790-3) likely not in good faith.\n\nTo restore continuity and avoid any further delays in bounty ops, this referendum proposes reinstating the same curator addresses for the following bounties:\n\n- [Open Source Developer Grants Program (Bounty 59)](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/59)\n- [Games Bounty (Bounty 38)](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/38)\n- [Polkadot Pioneers Prize (Bounty 10)](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/10)\n\nAll three teams have been contacted and are aligned on restoring the original curator setup. Going forward, this issue should no longer arise: a runtime upgrade will eventually allow bounty expiry to be set to 0, removing the need for curators to manually renew their role every 90 days.\n\nSecondly, as part of this referendum, I am also taking the opportunity to do some light housekeeping by closing down bounties that are no longer active, to reduce clutter. The following bounties are proposed for closure due to prolonged inactivity, lack of funding, or insufficient information:\n\n- https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/42\n- https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/60\n- https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/61\n- https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/65\n- https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/66\n- https://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/68",

      "title": "Polkadot GIGAHydration Campaign",
      "content": "Requested Amount: 5,000,000 DOT\n\nDate: 28-04-2025\n\nShort Description: **Allocate 5M DOT towards DeFi incentives on Hydration, the liquidity backbone of Polkadot. These incentives will be distributed over the course of 12 months to the following initiatives:**\n\n- **2M DOT stablecoin incentives;**\n- **2M DOT LP incentives;**\n- **1M DOT incentives to mint GIGADOT**\n\n## Summary\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) plays a foundational role in any healthy blockchain ecosystem, with Polkadot not being an exception. As the broader crypto market enters a phase of maximum competition, strategic incentives are essential to attract users, deepen liquidity, and strengthen the competitive edge of Polkadot’s ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal seeks Treasury support to fund DeFi incentives that will catalyze growth, foster adoption of ecosystem based products, and reinforce Polkadot’s position as a foundational layer for open, interoperable finance.\n\nThe proposal document begins by laying out the motivation behind the proposed incentives, together with a brief reflection on the success of the previous Polkadot Hydration liquidity campaign which kicked off in June 2024. Building upon that, it examines the three buckets of incentives that we propose for the upcoming 12 months, together with their success metrics. It concludes with some details on the execution of the proposal.\n\n# Please read the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TGepA6VGObrolRExsQ6CZVpQO62NHmvuxfqMTuNwn_c/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.1gdi5smm42un).\n\n----\n\n**EDIT [12-05-2025]:** In order to alleviate concerns around the full 5M DOT leaving custody of the Polkadot Treasury in one go, the funds will be kept in a pure proxy on Hydration with \"any\" proxy privileges shared between the Hydration Treasury & Polkadot root *(7KQx4f7yU3hqZHfvDVnSfe6mpgAT8Pxyr67LXHV6nsbZo3Tm)*. This ensures:\n- Opengov can reclaim unspent funds at any time\n- The balance can still be tracked on [doTreasury](https://polkadot.dotreasury.com/#/) along with all other Treasury stashes\n\n**EDIT [15-05-2025]:** Here is a table demonstrating how the DOT rewards can be distributed and the target TVL for each of the assets based on a $5 DOT price - as with the previous campaign, these will be adjusted based on ecosystem needs and analysis of their respective performances:\n\n[![3g8N4Qj.md.png](https://iili.io/3g8N4Qj.md.png)](https://freeimage.host/i/3g8N4Qj)\n\n----\n\n**EDIT [28-05-2025]:** After considering feedback from multiple parties and the upcoming launch of Polkadot Hub, we've agreed on the need for a more hollistic approach to liquidity incentivization with a broader view of how these incentives are deployed across different protocols.\n\nWe will shortly launch a referendum on Hydration committing to returning 3M of the 5M DOT if this proposal is successfully passed with significant support. The remaining 2M DOT will be distributed over a period of 6 months on Hydration, during which time we will work with Velocity Labs, Parity & Web3 Foundation on a wider and coordinated ecosystem incentivization campaign\n\nThis will help the ecosystem have better longer-term sustainability of incentives through the Polkadot Treasury - ensuring maximum support for the launch of Polkadot hub while creating synergies with existing DeFi products like Hydration",

      "content": "This Meta Proposal is the result of a collective effort by more than 11 ecosystem agents from complementary backgrounds (DonDiegoSanchez, Strindbergman, MoonBearer, Angie Dalton, xcRom1, Gatorkorps, Alex, Ben, Damsky, Marin, MrTin) and 7 partners (Airlyft, Braille, Nyvium Labs, ElevateCore, LeNexus, FaZe and Vitality) united by the same conviction:\n\n“Polkadot needs a clear, coordinated and operational interface to structure its public actions.”\n\nMillions are spent each year on various initiatives to promote the Polkadot brand to consumers and professionals. However, we don't really have the internal tools we need to maximise and make the most of this spend. In fact, much of this money is wasted as new users discovering Polkadot are often left to themselves and our lead management has a lot of room for improvement. Some recent proposals have also underlined the utter complexity for \"outsiders\" to understand and interact with OpenGov. And while this is due to the very nature of our decentralised governance, that doesn't mean it doesn't sometimes reflect poorly on us and the proposers. \n\nWe want to change that. \n\nThis meta-proposal, which combines 7 different proposals into one, aims to strengthen the Polkadot Hivemind and provide it with the necessary tools not only to make the most of the partnerships presented in this proposal, but also to increase the efficiency of all outward-facing initiatives, whether they're aimed at retail, cloud or hub users. \n\nIt not only secures a partnerships with the two biggest esports organization in the world giving polkadot a global venue for user and business acquisition, it also propose the deployment of dedicated department, the development of ecosystem tools and the creation a specific apps and building blocks coordinated with the launch of Polkadot Hub to make sure we’ll get the most value out of it. \n\nDiscover the [FaZe x Vitality - Esport Meta Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9r28BijpHeGd2z_20aolwHUv7cxHovnH-7Im7X2W7Y/edit?tab=t.0) \n",

Established in 2022, IBP is a globally distributed and resilient ecosystem service provider, thanks to its unique design. This proposal seeks to secure continued funding for the services it provides to the ecosystem.\n\n**!Note!:**\nThe requested amount is a top-up for the IBP bounty, which is managed by five Polkadot-native curators. The IBP bounty pays compensation for the services provided only retroactively. The amount is for the theoretical max deployment capacity. Actual annualized cost was $2,490,996 for 552 Relay and System-chain and 154 Parachain RPC nodes\n\nRPC services are all paid retroactively for delivered services monthly by USD value.\n\n**See the Full Proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aK7XtMmpF5FVlt9FGP1puVPHGRktbFQ8M9o6Dh3u9jw)**\n\n**Edit:**\nVarious ecosystem members have provided feedback and IBP services will not be offered to ecosystem participants that have, beyond all doubt, defrauded the treasury.",

      "content": "The discussion was kickstarted on December 15th 2024 with this discussion: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2630\n\nThe main concern is the lack of activity and deliverables of this bounty. As expressed by the original discussion, this bounty was meant to be reactive to other external business development efforts seeking to integrate technical solutions but in 10 months it's had no activity and only 1 child bounty has been granted. \n\nhttps://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/child-bounties/49_2672\n\nThere were several comments pointing out that this bounty could be useful for certain support activities but we have not seen any initiative to move in any direction.\n\nThe remark on the bounty extension on 2024-10-02 (4 months ago) was “We have been setting up the bounty's operation. In the next bounty period, we expect an start increase in activity.”\n\nhttps://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/22797894-3\n\nA second extension occurred on 2024-12-18 around the same time the discussion about closing the bounty occurred. No on-chain activity other than that has been recorded.\n\nhttps://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/23893006-2\n\nSaxemberg will be voting in favor of the closure of bounty 49 as BD on Polkadot is composed of different DF, BD, dApp teams with a diverse set of skills, goals, locations/geographies and activities so each effort has sought their own solutions for technical integrations, usually independently and on their own conditions without having interact with this bounty. \n\nGiven that during the discussion period there were some voices that mentioned some solutions, we waited and postponed this referendum for last to see if there was any initiative with respect to any of the previously mentioned solutions but neither a new solution initiative, change or child bounty was initiated so we understand that the current status quo of the bounty will remain.",

Rather than focusing solely on Polkadot as a brand, we create comprehensive campaigns that:\n\n1.  Support ecosystem projects with targeted exposure to our crypto-native audience\n    \n2.  Provide quantifiable metrics and clear ROI tracking\n    \n3.  Generate measurable increases in awareness and engagement for participating dApps\n    \n4.  Create sustainable growth through coordinated ecosystem-wide initiatives\n    \n\nThis holistic strategy has already proven successful through our initial campaign, where we delivered significant brand lift and engagement metrics.

It has only 3 child bounties recorded.\n\nhttps://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/bounties/27\n\nhttps://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/child-bounties/27_745\n\nhttps://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/child-bounties/27_747\n\nhttps://polkadot.subsquare.io/treasury/child-bounties/27_746\n\n223 days ago, curators became unassigned no further activity has been recorded since (i.e. Bounty was not extended and it has become curatorless).\n\nhttps://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/20889489-2\n\nThis bounty was meant to be reactive for all parachain teams looking to integrate their parachains into the Banxa on/off ramps but it's had no activity and the former curators and people spearheading this bounty are working on other efforts away from Polkadot. We found no parties interested in the integration proposed by this bounty as well as curators willing to take over this bounty during the discussion phase which, as of now remains abandoned. We consider there are grounds for closing this bounty due to inactivity and lack of impact on payment rails and on/off ramps. \n\nWe have reached to the original proposer on X without reply. So now we submit this referendum to OpenGov to decide the future of Bounty 27.\n\nThis referendum follows the discussion on Polkassembly at: https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2629\n\nand the socialization on X on our account:\nhttps://x.com/saxemberg/status/1869020723026821326",

This bounty is strategically designed to amplify Polkadot’s strengths by boosting community engagement and showcasing our technological innovations. Our operational strategy is built on a foundation of transparency and rigorous ethical standards, ensuring that every action taken is in the best interest of the community. With adequate funding, we are ready to drive substantial results. We will measure our success through tangible increases in ecosystem growth and engagement. These metrics will reflect the efficacy of our marketing strategies and our alignment with Polkadot’s long-term strategic objectives._\n\n**Distractive** - _Distractive is joining the Bounty because we intend to be in the room where decisions are made that affect marketing as a whole, guide with the roadmap that we shaped with our closest stakeholders, and get the highest impact per DOT possible._\n\n_We value reasonable, conservative budgeting, collaborative decision-making, tough negotiation for the best deals, and a detailed marketing planning approach._\n\n_We believe further that we have to build global partnerships with actors (agencies, marketers, brands, etc.) that apply our global strategy for more brand awareness and ecosystem growth in the respective region to target our archetypes (builders who are fed up by Web2 and the moat of FAANGs, creators who want to own their creations, gamers who want to earn money and not be squeezed by studios, fans who want to support their bands, and others)._\n\n_Also, as marketing professionals, we don’t work without meaningful KPIs that allow proper campaign testing, management, and reporting, which drive our economy on measurable metrics._\n\n_By doing so, we believe that we will contribute with the best intent and skill, to produce the best results._\n\n**Evan** - I _intend for this bounty to operate under the following tenets: Efficient use of funds - Curators/advisors seek optimal pricing by inviting competition.

Requested Funds**\n\nAn allocation of **200,000 DOT per month** over a **six-month schedule** will sustain essential marketing functions while providing some flexibility. Should the market and treasury conditions be favorable and the operational mechanisms of the bounty function efficiently, this allocation can be increased in the future, subject to the agreement of token holders.\n\nIn instances where significant funding requests arise for marketing, for example a sport sponsorship proposal, a special fund for the growth bounty can be proposed through an OpenGov proposal. This way token holders have a say in big extraordinary spends, while profiting from the expertise and the oversight of the marketing bounty.\n\n**9\\. Mission statement / Scope**\n\n9.1 Initial Goals\n\nThe primary objectives include:\n\n1.  Implementing the Marketing Strategy: Execute a comprehensive marketing strategy for the Polkadot ecosystem, drawing on insights from OpenGov, Distractive, and key stakeholders.

Cross-Industry Communications: Connecting with traditional companies to raise awareness of Polkadot’s benefits for enhancing business operations.\n\n**9.3. Long-Term Objectives**\n\n1.  Marketing through one Marketing Bounty: Ideally, channel all decentralized marketing efforts through the Marketing Bounty to ensure scalability and effectiveness.\n2.  Strong Developer Relations Strategy: Develop a robust strategy to maintain and strengthen relationships with developers across the ecosystem and beyond.\n3.  Positive VC & Investor Sentiment: Attract new funding pools that further increase the ecosystem viability for developers and founders.\n4.  Attract Masses of Users: To attract new developers, we increase the visibility of ready-to-use use cases and strengthen the user base based on an upward momentum in the public perception of Polkadot.\n\nThese structured efforts are designed to significantly elevate the reach and impact of the Polkadot ecosystem, driving engagement and adoption across diverse sectors and communities.\n\n**10\\. Operational Overview**\n\n-   **Agency Engagement:** The strategy involves partnering with experienced agencies that are not native to the Polkadot ecoto significantly extend Polkadot’s marketing reach. The bounty team will guide these external agencies or agents to align all marketing efforts with Polkadot’s strategic objectives.\n-   **Compensation Models:** Contributors will be compensated on an hourly basis, while external agencies will be engaged on a commission basis. This structure ensures that contributions are fairly remunerated and that external partnerships are goal-oriented and results-driven.\n-   **Support Functions:** Technical and accounting support will be integral, ensuring all operations are executed accurately and adhere to high standards.\n-   **Routine Reporting:** In-depth reports will be generated monthly, modeled after the structure of the PAL Bounty (see: PAL Community Reports). These reports aim to maintain transparency and provide continuous updates on project progress and financial status.\n-   **Comprehensive End-of-Period Reporting**: A detailed report will be produced at the end of each funding period to assess the overall performance and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts.\n-   **Engagement Opportunities:** Monthly open office hours will be scheduled, offering a platform for stakeholders to inquire about project details, voice concerns, and provide feedback.\n-   **Accounting Practices**: A skilled accountant will be onboarded to ensure accurate and transparent invoicing. A comprehensive master budget will be maintained, showcasing available funds in the bounty, denominated in USD. This budget will include detailed categories such as pending payouts, confirmed and paid amounts, as well as requested funds.\n-   **Oversight Capabilities:** Curators will have access to review invoices from contracted agencies, ensuring that commission rates remain competitive and transparent. This oversight is critical to maintaining fiscal responsibility and ensuring that funds are used effectively. We acknowledge the recently published guideline suggestions by OpenGov.Watch and will strive to adhere as closely as possible to these standards: WFC Draft Bounty Standards.\n\n**11\\. Success Metrics**\n\nThe Bounty program is committed to establishing a robust framework for measuring success, which will adapt and evolve to reflect the ongoing learning and changing dynamics of our operations. Initially, our focus is on setting up foundational metrics that do not constrain operations but rather inform and guide our processes towards efficiency and transparency.\n\n**General Principles:**\n\n-   Flexibility in Metrics: Initially, we will employ a flexible approach to metrics, allowing us to refine and adjust as we gain more insights into what is most effective.\n-   Evolution Over Time: As the Bounty program matures, we will develop and hone specific metrics that truly reflect the value and success of our initiatives.\n\n**Areas of Measurement:**\n\n-   Bounty Management: We will monitor general efficiency, team quality, number of campaigns launched, and overhead costs. These metrics are starting points and will be adapted based on operational feedback and results.\n-   Transparency Reporting: Essential documentation such as quotes, invoices, contracts, payments, proposals, and deliverables will be tracked to ensure accountability and openness in all dealings.\n-   Curator Reports: We will begin with tracking hours, task descriptions, milestone achievements, project completions, and availability in AMA sessions, with the view to adjust based on what metrics provide meaningful insights.\n-   Marketing Management: Early metrics will include the selection of balanced scorecards, results tracking, impact value chain metrics, and community sharing practices. These will be reviewed and refined to align with strategic marketing goals.\n\n**Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**\n\n-   Feedback Loops: Regular feedback from all stakeholders will be instrumental in revising our metrics. This feedback will help ensure that our metrics are not only measurable but meaningful.\n-   Reporting: We will share initial findings and adaptations through our regular reporting processes, ensuring that the community and stakeholders are fully informed of our progress and how our metrics are evolving.\n\nThis measured and adaptable approach ensures that we remain agile and responsive, rather than rigidly adhering to metrics that may not serve our long-term strategic goals.\n\n**12\\. Closing Statement**\n\nOur commitment remains steadfast to advancing the Polkadot ecosystem through well-structured and effectively managed marketing strategies. We acknowledge the errors the old Marketing Bounty had and use these to strive for improvement. This proposal lays the groundwork for a transparent, efficient, and ethical approach to ecosystem marketing, ensuring all activities are aligned with the collective vision of our community and stakeholders.\n\nThank you for your support, and we look forward to your active participation in shaping a vibrant future for Polkadot. Together, we will maintain Polkadot's leadership in Web3 technology.",

Requested Funds**\n\nAn allocation of **200,000 DOT per month** over a **six-month schedule** will sustain essential marketing functions while providing some flexibility. Should the market and treasury conditions be favorable and the operational mechanisms of the bounty function efficiently, this allocation can be increased in the future, subject to the agreement of token holders.\n\nIn instances where significant funding requests arise for marketing, for example a sport sponsorship proposal, a special fund for the growth bounty can be proposed through an OpenGov proposal. This way token holders have a say in big extraordinary spends, while profiting from the expertise and the oversight of the marketing bounty.\n\n**9\\. Mission statement / Scope**\n\n9.1 Initial Goals\n\nThe primary objectives include:\n\n1.  Implementing the Marketing Strategy: Execute a comprehensive marketing strategy for the Polkadot ecosystem, drawing on insights from OpenGov, Distractive, and key stakeholders.

Executing Marketing Operations: Manage ongoing marketing activities and regular campaigns that focus on brand positioning and product offerings.\n3.  Processing Marketing Proposals: Handle incoming proposals that align with the Polkadot ecosystem’s strategic goals.\n\n**9.2 Areas of Work**\n\nThe marketing efforts will encompass several key areas:\n\n1.  Strategy: Crafting overarching strategies that align with long-term objectives.\n2.  Market Research: Conducting thorough research to stay ahead of market trends and understand the competitive landscape.\n3.  Vetting: Rigorous evaluation of marketing proposals and potential partnerships.\n4.  Campaigns: Developing and deploying campaigns focused on branding, positioning, and product awareness.\n5.

Cross-Chain Communications: Engaging with other blockchain communities to educate and collaborate, aiming to onboard new stakeholders.\n12.  Cross-Industry Communications: Connecting with traditional companies to raise awareness of Polkadot’s benefits for enhancing business operations.\n\n**9.3. Long-Term Objectives**\n\n1.  Marketing through one Marketing Bounty: Ideally, channel all decentralized marketing efforts through the Marketing Bounty to ensure scalability and effectiveness.\n2.  Strong Developer Relations Strategy: Develop a robust strategy to maintain and strengthen relationships with developers across the ecosystem and beyond.\n3.  Positive VC & Investor Sentiment: Attract new funding pools that further increase the ecosystem viability for developers and founders.\n4.  Attract Masses of Users: To attract new developers, we increase the visibility of ready-to-use use cases and strengthen the user base based on an upward momentum in the public perception of Polkadot.\n\nThese structured efforts are designed to significantly elevate the reach and impact of the Polkadot ecosystem, driving engagement and adoption across diverse sectors and communities.\n\n**10\\. Operational Overview**\n\n-   **Agency Engagement:** The strategy involves partnering with experienced agencies that are not native to the Polkadot ecoto significantly extend Polkadot’s marketing reach. The bounty team will guide these external agencies or agents to align all marketing efforts with Polkadot’s strategic objectives.\n-   **Compensation Models:** Contributors will be compensated on an hourly basis, while external agencies will be engaged on a commission basis. This structure ensures that contributions are fairly remunerated and that external partnerships are goal-oriented and results-driven.\n-   **Support Functions:** Technical and accounting support will be integral, ensuring all operations are executed accurately and adhere to high standards.\n-   **Routine Reporting:** In-depth reports will be generated monthly, modeled after the structure of the PAL Bounty (see: PAL Community Reports). These reports aim to maintain transparency and provide continuous updates on project progress and financial status.\n-   **Comprehensive End-of-Period Reporting**: A detailed report will be produced at the end of each funding period to assess the overall performance and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts.\n-   **Engagement Opportunities:** Monthly open office hours will be scheduled, offering a platform for stakeholders to inquire about project details, voice concerns, and provide feedback.\n-   **Accounting Practices**: A skilled accountant will be onboarded to ensure accurate and transparent invoicing. A comprehensive master budget will be maintained, showcasing available funds in the bounty, denominated in USD. This budget will include detailed categories such as pending payouts, confirmed and paid amounts, as well as requested funds.\n-   **Oversight Capabilities:** Curators will have access to review invoices from contracted agencies, ensuring that commission rates remain competitive and transparent. This oversight is critical to maintaining fiscal responsibility and ensuring that funds are used effectively. We acknowledge the recently published guideline suggestions by OpenGov.Watch and will strive to adhere as closely as possible to these standards: WFC Draft Bounty Standards.\n\n**11\\. Success Metrics**\n\nThe Bounty program is committed to establishing a robust framework for measuring success, which will adapt and evolve to reflect the ongoing learning and changing dynamics of our operations. Initially, our focus is on setting up foundational metrics that do not constrain operations but rather inform and guide our processes towards efficiency and transparency.\n\n**General Principles:**\n\n-   Flexibility in Metrics: Initially, we will employ a flexible approach to metrics, allowing us to refine and adjust as we gain more insights into what is most effective.\n-   Evolution Over Time: As the Bounty program matures, we will develop and hone specific metrics that truly reflect the value and success of our initiatives.\n\n**Areas of Measurement:**\n\n-   Bounty Management: We will monitor general efficiency, team quality, number of campaigns launched, and overhead costs. These metrics are starting points and will be adapted based on operational feedback and results.\n-   Transparency Reporting: Essential documentation such as quotes, invoices, contracts, payments, proposals, and deliverables will be tracked to ensure accountability and openness in all dealings.\n-   Curator Reports: We will begin with tracking hours, task descriptions, milestone achievements, project completions, and availability in AMA sessions, with the view to adjust based on what metrics provide meaningful insights.\n-   Marketing Management: Early metrics will include the selection of balanced scorecards, results tracking, impact value chain metrics, and community sharing practices. These will be reviewed and refined to align with strategic marketing goals.\n\n**Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**\n\n-   Feedback Loops: Regular feedback from all stakeholders will be instrumental in revising our metrics. This feedback will help ensure that our metrics are not only measurable but meaningful.\n-   Reporting: We will share initial findings and adaptations through our regular reporting processes, ensuring that the community and stakeholders are fully informed of our progress and how our metrics are evolving.\n\nThis measured and adaptable approach ensures that we remain agile and responsive, rather than rigidly adhering to metrics that may not serve our long-term strategic goals.\n\n**12\\. Closing Statement**\n\nOur commitment remains steadfast to advancing the Polkadot ecosystem through well-structured and effectively managed marketing strategies. We acknowledge the errors the old Marketing Bounty had and use these to strive for improvement. This proposal lays the groundwork for a transparent, efficient, and ethical approach to ecosystem marketing, ensuring all activities are aligned with the collective vision of our community and stakeholders.\n\nThank you for your support, and we look forward to your active participation in shaping a vibrant future for Polkadot. Together, we will maintain Polkadot's leadership in Web3 technology.",

This structure ensures that contributions are fairly remunerated and that external partnerships are goal-oriented and results-driven.\n-   **Support Functions:** Technical and accounting support will be integral, ensuring all operations are executed accurately and adhere to high standards.\n-   **Routine Reporting:** In-depth reports will be generated monthly, modeled after the structure of the PAL Bounty (see: PAL Community Reports). These reports aim to maintain transparency and provide continuous updates on project progress and financial status.\n-   **Comprehensive End-of-Period Reporting**: A detailed report will be produced at the end of each funding period to assess the overall performance and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts.\n-   **Engagement Opportunities:** Monthly open office hours will be scheduled, offering a platform for stakeholders to inquire about project details, voice concerns, and provide feedback.\n-   **Accounting Practices**: A skilled accountant will be onboarded to ensure accurate and transparent invoicing. A comprehensive master budget will be maintained, showcasing available funds in the bounty, denominated in USD. This budget will include detailed categories such as pending payouts, confirmed and paid amounts, as well as requested funds.\n-   **Oversight Capabilities:** Curators will have access to review invoices from contracted agencies, ensuring that commission rates remain competitive and transparent. This oversight is critical to maintaining fiscal responsibility and ensuring that funds are used effectively. We acknowledge the recently published guideline suggestions by OpenGov.Watch and will strive to adhere as closely as possible to these standards: WFC Draft Bounty Standards.\n\n**11\\. Success Metrics**\n\nThe Bounty program is committed to establishing a robust framework for measuring success, which will adapt and evolve to reflect the ongoing learning and changing dynamics of our operations. Initially, our focus is on setting up foundational metrics that do not constrain operations but rather inform and guide our processes towards efficiency and transparency.\n\n**General Principles:**\n\n-   Flexibility in Metrics: Initially, we will employ a flexible approach to metrics, allowing us to refine and adjust as we gain more insights into what is most effective.\n-   Evolution Over Time: As the Bounty program matures, we will develop and hone specific metrics that truly reflect the value and success of our initiatives.\n\n**Areas of Measurement:**\n\n-   Bounty Management: We will monitor general efficiency, team quality, number of campaigns launched, and overhead costs. These metrics are starting points and will be adapted based on operational feedback and results.\n-   Transparency Reporting: Essential documentation such as quotes, invoices, contracts, payments, proposals, and deliverables will be tracked to ensure accountability and openness in all dealings.\n-   Curator Reports: We will begin with tracking hours, task descriptions, milestone achievements, project completions, and availability in AMA sessions, with the view to adjust based on what metrics provide meaningful insights.\n-   Marketing Management: Early metrics will include the selection of balanced scorecards, results tracking, impact value chain metrics, and community sharing practices. These will be reviewed and refined to align with strategic marketing goals.\n\n**Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**\n\n-   Feedback Loops: Regular feedback from all stakeholders will be instrumental in revising our metrics. This feedback will help ensure that our metrics are not only measurable but meaningful.\n-   Reporting: We will share initial findings and adaptations through our regular reporting processes, ensuring that the community and stakeholders are fully informed of our progress and how our metrics are evolving.\n\nThis measured and adaptable approach ensures that we remain agile and responsive, rather than rigidly adhering to metrics that may not serve our long-term strategic goals.\n\n**12\\. Closing Statement**\n\nOur commitment remains steadfast to advancing the Polkadot ecosystem through well-structured and effectively managed marketing strategies. We acknowledge the errors the old Marketing Bounty had and use these to strive for improvement. This proposal lays the groundwork for a transparent, efficient, and ethical approach to ecosystem marketing, ensuring all activities are aligned with the collective vision of our community and stakeholders.\n\nThank you for your support, and we look forward to your active participation in shaping a vibrant future for Polkadot. Together, we will maintain Polkadot's leadership in Web3 technology.",

I am here to ensure the highest level of transparency and efficacy in the management of the Marketing Bounty 2.0 as one strong entity. I am dedicated to managing the Marketing Bounty to significantly enhance Polkadot's visibility and adoption through targeted marketing and strong community-driven initiatives. Our ecosystem is not only rich with cutting-edge products but also with a community of highly skilled professionals who deserve more recognition and opportunities. In leading this initiative, I will leverage my extensive experience in steering projects and teams towards high-impact outcomes. This bounty is strategically designed to amplify Polkadot’s strengths by boosting community engagement and showcasing our technological innovations. Our operational strategy is built on a foundation of transparency and rigorous ethical standards, ensuring that every action taken is in the best interest of the community. With adequate funding, we are ready to drive substantial results. We will measure our success through tangible increases in ecosystem growth and engagement. These metrics will reflect the efficacy of our marketing strategies and our alignment with Polkadot’s long-term strategic objectives._\n\n**Distractive** - _Distractive is joining the Bounty because we intend to be in the room where decisions are made that affect marketing as a whole, guide with the roadmap that we shaped with our closest stakeholders, and get the highest impact per DOT possible._\n\n_We value reasonable, conservative budgeting, collaborative decision-making, tough negotiation for the best deals, and a detailed marketing planning approach._\n\n_We believe further that we have to build global partnerships with actors (agencies, marketers, brands, etc.) that apply our global strategy for more brand awareness and ecosystem growth in the respective region to target our archetypes (builders who are fed up by Web2 and the moat of FAANGs, creators who want to own their creations, gamers who want to earn money and not be squeezed by studios, fans who want to support their bands, and others)._\n\n_Also, as marketing professionals, we don’t work without meaningful KPIs that allow proper campaign testing, management, and reporting, which drive our economy on measurable metrics._\n\n_By doing so, we believe that we will contribute with the best intent and skill, to produce the best results._\n\n**Evan** - I _intend for this bounty to operate under the following tenets: Efficient use of funds - Curators/advisors seek optimal pricing by inviting competition.

Requested Funds**\n\nAn allocation of **200,000 DOT per month** over a **six-month schedule** will sustain essential marketing functions while providing some flexibility. Should the market and treasury conditions be favorable and the operational mechanisms of the bounty function efficiently, this allocation can be increased in the future, subject to the agreement of token holders.\n\nIn instances where significant funding requests arise for marketing, for example a sport sponsorship proposal, a special fund for the growth bounty can be proposed through an OpenGov proposal.

To note: these specialists would not be signatories of the bounty, instead, working agents to help manage research, development, outreach and deliveries of projects completed by external agencies._\n\n_Roles & Responsibilities - Reviewing submitted proposals and negotiating fair costs for each new submitted proposal. Optimizing accepted projects, agencies and individuals who are being funded by this channel and wherever necessary for the bounty as a whole. Researching and obtaining new agencies & talent that is both financially & creatively competitive for this channel and for the bounty in general. Focusing on cross chain communication between Polkadot and existing blockchains Focusing on cross industry communication between Polkadot and non-crypto entities_\n\n**8\\. Requested Funds**\n\nAn allocation of **200,000 DOT per month** over a **six-month schedule** will sustain essential marketing functions while providing some flexibility. Should the market and treasury conditions be favorable and the operational mechanisms of the bounty function efficiently, this allocation can be increased in the future, subject to the agreement of token holders.\n\nIn instances where significant funding requests arise for marketing, for example a sport sponsorship proposal, a special fund for the growth bounty can be proposed through an OpenGov proposal. This way token holders have a say in big extraordinary spends, while profiting from the expertise and the oversight of the marketing bounty.\n\n**9\\. Mission statement / Scope**\n\n9.1 Initial Goals\n\nThe primary objectives include:\n\n1.  Implementing the Marketing Strategy: Execute a comprehensive marketing strategy for the Polkadot ecosystem, drawing on insights from OpenGov, Distractive, and key stakeholders. This strategy will be dynamic and adapt to ongoing feedback and market fundamentals.\n2.  Executing Marketing Operations: Manage ongoing marketing activities and regular campaigns that focus on brand positioning and product offerings.\n3.  Processing Marketing Proposals: Handle incoming proposals that align with the Polkadot ecosystem’s strategic goals.\n\n9.2 Areas of Work\n\nThe marketing efforts will encompass several key areas:\n\n1.  Strategy: Crafting overarching strategies that align with long-term objectives.\n2.  Market Research: Conducting thorough research to stay ahead of market trends and understand the competitive landscape.\n3.  Vetting: Rigorous evaluation of marketing proposals and potential partnerships.\n4.  Campaigns: Developing and deploying campaigns focused on branding, positioning, and product awareness.\n5.

Paid Media: Strategically investing in advertising to reach broader audiences. Reporting:\n10.  Providing detailed reports and analytics to measure the impact and efficiency of marketing efforts.\n11.  Cross-Chain Communications: Engaging with other blockchain communities to educate and collaborate, aiming to onboard new stakeholders.\n12.  Cross-Industry Communications: Connecting with traditional companies to raise awareness of Polkadot’s benefits for enhancing business operations.\n\n9.3. Long-Term Objectives\n\n1.  Marketing through one Marketing Bounty: Ideally, channel all decentralized marketing efforts through the Marketing Bounty to ensure scalability and effectiveness.\n2.  Strong Developer Relations Strategy: Develop a robust strategy to maintain and strengthen relationships with developers across the ecosystem and beyond.\n3.  Positive VC & Investor Sentiment: Attract new funding pools that further increase the ecosystem viability for developers and founders.\n4.  Attract Masses of Users: To attract new developers, we increase the visibility of ready-to-use use cases and strengthen the user base based on an upward momentum in the public perception of Polkadot.\n\nThese structured efforts are designed to significantly elevate the reach and impact of the Polkadot ecosystem, driving engagement and adoption across diverse sectors and communities.\n\n**10\\. Operational Overview**\n\n-   **Agency Engagement:** The strategy involves partnering with experienced agencies that are not native to the Polkadot ecoto significantly extend Polkadot’s marketing reach. The bounty team will guide these external agencies or agents to align all marketing efforts with Polkadot’s strategic objectives.\n-   **Compensation Models:** Contributors will be compensated on an hourly basis, while external agencies will be engaged on a commission basis. This structure ensures that contributions are fairly remunerated and that external partnerships are goal-oriented and results-driven.\n-   **Support Functions:** Technical and accounting support will be integral, ensuring all operations are executed accurately and adhere to high standards.\n-   **Routine Reporting:** In-depth reports will be generated monthly, modeled after the structure of the PAL Bounty (see: PAL Community Reports). These reports aim to maintain transparency and provide continuous updates on project progress and financial status.\n-   **Comprehensive End-of-Period Reporting**: A detailed report will be produced at the end of each funding period to assess the overall performance and the effectiveness of the marketing efforts.\n-   **Engagement Opportunities:** Monthly open office hours will be scheduled, offering a platform for stakeholders to inquire about project details, voice concerns, and provide feedback.\n-   **Accounting Practices**: A skilled accountant will be onboarded to ensure accurate and transparent invoicing. A comprehensive master budget will be maintained, showcasing available funds in the bounty, denominated in USD. This budget will include detailed categories such as pending payouts, confirmed and paid amounts, as well as requested funds.\n-   **Oversight Capabilities:** Curators will have access to review invoices from contracted agencies, ensuring that commission rates remain competitive and transparent. This oversight is critical to maintaining fiscal responsibility and ensuring that funds are used effectively. We acknowledge the recently published guideline suggestions by OpenGov.Watch and will strive to adhere as closely as possible to these standards: WFC Draft Bounty Standards.\n\n**11\\. Success Metrics**\n\nThe Bounty program is committed to establishing a robust framework for measuring success, which will adapt and evolve to reflect the ongoing learning and changing dynamics of our operations. Initially, our focus is on setting up foundational metrics that do not constrain operations but rather inform and guide our processes towards efficiency and transparency.\n\n**General Principles:**\n\n-   Flexibility in Metrics: Initially, we will employ a flexible approach to metrics, allowing us to refine and adjust as we gain more insights into what is most effective.\n-   Evolution Over Time: As the Bounty program matures, we will develop and hone specific metrics that truly reflect the value and success of our initiatives.\n\n**Areas of Measurement:**\n\n-   Bounty Management: We will monitor general efficiency, team quality, number of campaigns launched, and overhead costs. These metrics are starting points and will be adapted based on operational feedback and results.\n-   Transparency Reporting: Essential documentation such as quotes, invoices, contracts, payments, proposals, and deliverables will be tracked to ensure accountability and openness in all dealings.\n-   Curator Reports: We will begin with tracking hours, task descriptions, milestone achievements, project completions, and availability in AMA sessions, with the view to adjust based on what metrics provide meaningful insights.\n-   Marketing Management: Early metrics will include the selection of balanced scorecards, results tracking, impact value chain metrics, and community sharing practices. These will be reviewed and refined to align with strategic marketing goals.\n\n**Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**\n\n-   Feedback Loops: Regular feedback from all stakeholders will be instrumental in revising our metrics. This feedback will help ensure that our metrics are not only measurable but meaningful.\n-   Reporting: We will share initial findings and adaptations through our regular reporting processes, ensuring that the community and stakeholders are fully informed of our progress and how our metrics are evolving.\n\nThis measured and adaptable approach ensures that we remain agile and responsive, rather than rigidly adhering to metrics that may not serve our long-term strategic goals.\n\n**12\\. Closing Statement**\n\nOur commitment remains steadfast to advancing the Polkadot ecosystem through well-structured and effectively managed marketing strategies. We acknowledge the errors the old Marketing Bounty had and use these to strive for improvement. This proposal lays the groundwork for a transparent, efficient, and ethical approach to ecosystem marketing, ensuring all activities are aligned with the collective vision of our community and stakeholders.\n\nThank you for your support, and we look forward to your active participation in shaping a vibrant future for Polkadot. Together, we will maintain Polkadot's leadership in Web3 technology.",

Operational Overview**\n\n-   **Agency Engagement:** The strategy involves partnering with experienced agencies that are not native to the Polkadot ecoto significantly extend Polkadot’s marketing reach.

These will be reviewed and refined to align with strategic marketing goals.\n\n**Commitment to Continuous Improvement:**\n\n-   Feedback Loops: Regular feedback from all stakeholders will be instrumental in revising our metrics. This feedback will help ensure that our metrics are not only measurable but meaningful.\n-   Reporting: We will share initial findings and adaptations through our regular reporting processes, ensuring that the community and stakeholders are fully informed of our progress and how our metrics are evolving.\n\nThis measured and adaptable approach ensures that we remain agile and responsive, rather than rigidly adhering to metrics that may not serve our long-term strategic goals.\n\n**12\\. Closing Statement**\n\nOur commitment remains steadfast to advancing the Polkadot ecosystem through well-structured and effectively managed marketing strategies. We acknowledge the errors the old Marketing Bounty had and use these to strive for improvement. This proposal lays the groundwork for a transparent, efficient, and ethical approach to ecosystem marketing, ensuring all activities are aligned with the collective vision of our community and stakeholders.\n\nThank you for your support, and we look forward to your active participation in shaping a vibrant future for Polkadot.

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November.

Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

It is promoted as NASCAR's second-tier circuit to the organization's top level Cup Series. NXS events are frequently held as a support race on the day prior to a Cup Series event scheduled for that weekend.\n\nThe series was previously called the Budweiser Late Model Sportsman Series in 1982 and 1983, the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series from 1984 through 2002, the NASCAR Busch Series from 2003 through 2007, and the NASCAR Nationwide Series from 2008 through 2014. Since 2015, it has been sponsored by Comcast via its consumer cable and wireless brand Xfinity.\n\nThe Xfinity Series typically features about 33 races each season, running from February to November. These races occur across a wide range of venues in the United States. The series enjoys significant media coverage, with broadcasts on major sports networks and extensive digital content across social media platforms. This exposure helps promote the series and its drivers, attracting fans and sponsors\n\n![image23.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYnx9GyPqAh83VuHbcPSEZ9UEG6QcoDHPLYKXoUeq7KPj)\n\n![image26.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfSxL1pi2m62u2ZcoPEhdytESgwbzxv1P9DMXLyhjV9Gi)\n\n![image25.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu2SUdYwJGeNAtfH8PDvTw6sxxWMEyd7RWDsHuH7wzJR)\n\n![image16.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeCpkraL1nQm7oir7bELaGbuGrPfScABAhwTtwCmyr38b)\n\n![image30.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmR56q5upxQbrxYyxjafSPXFWG5ckASu5q1h4Z5LpMrute)\n\n![image29.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcTnVLBx8Ji1TDFJLyWqYHX1BdCPXosrLmdQywfz1oK61)\n\n![image3.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXNF5TJ9N3rHxXz9YbrKxqQybcMXE8mpv68gbvGsmzpoR)\n\n![image7.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUt8uXFSy5c1onkSeTcWnbnzCQ1BJNnfavrorGGDbHxS7)\n\n![image32.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSoJm3bj5RzxUzXpKWF3VVRTMofE6ZH636njYfSoD21tz)\n\n![image10.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSF72egc2sHtKZ8iev7zkdgDccCBqFFqtxRTeuYAZF1qs)\n\n![image9.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme9SXwmY1MT9JTJDqU1ZjyotsG1LJs5V273dRvho9ubWt)\n\n![image6.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmTkHg2fkWguk5VkQv6bjr7jbLS9KhGUdKtW57mZ9xJiu2)\n\nXfinity race fields have varied in the number of drivers. Prior to 2013, the grid size resembled its Cup counterpart with 43 cars per race; that year, it shrank to 40 maximum cars. The field was further reduced in 2019 and 2020 to 38 and 36, respectively.During the 2020 season, fields were temporarily increased to 40 cars again to accommodate part-time teams that were otherwise unable to qualify due to such sessions being canceled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**What is the Indianapolis 500** The [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500), formally known as the Indianapolis 500-Mile Race, and commonly called the Indy 500, is an annual automobile race held at Indianapolis Motor Speedway (IMS) in Speedway, Indiana, United States, in the largest sporting facility in the world, with more than 250,000 grandstand seats and the ability to host close to 400,000 on race day throughout the entire property, thus setting the world record for being the World's largest single-day sporting event, according to the World Record Academy.\n\nFor over a century, 33 drivers have raced 200 laps around the legendary oval at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, determined to come out on top. The Indy 500 is a timeless tradition and practically a month-long holiday for fans, friends, and families. The two to three weeks of practice and qualifying leading up to the Indianapolis 500 is known in racing circles simply as \"the month of May\". In early years, the track traditionally opened for practice on May 1 (regardless of the day of the week). This practice dated back to 1911. Whether it is practice and qualifying, the pit stop challenge, the snakepit, the community concerts, or the “greatest spectacle in racing” the month of May is packed with events for everyone.\n\nMore than 1,000 journalists and photographers are credentialed to cover the month of May and the Indianapolis 500 each year. NBC Sports, IndyCar's flagship network, reported that in 2024 the [Indianapolis 500](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/indy-500/2024/05/30/2024-indy-500-breaks-record-nbc-universo-13-3-million-total-viewers/73911545007/#:~:text=2024%20Indianapolis%20500%20breaks%20record,viewers%20on%20NBC%20and%20Universo&text=The%202024%20Indianapolis%20500%20brought,viewers%20across%20NBC%20and%20Universo.) drew a record 13.3 million viewers (an 8% increase), a 18.15 household rating, and a 54 share.\n\n![image5.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmScMzRy4kt758HbVKFWBRR5EMAXedt9o9oXXTrjGiTy6S)\n\n![image31.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWqfhH3pboiYkUUTSQKQ7tQmXMQ9UNbf8H6pyStUNpgdi)\n\n![image17.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmX6cKn2No5suge2fo7T89TqUdbhcYwDjGXCYmjg8nABdA)\n\n![image33.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUUuXf7ssvfgrpE46pqASeVxeUqcNMd3cR1apqmiDANSA)\n\n![image2.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdHvUo1DYwGxsAd9xKjLxPCqSZjQBXcD3xxRHkW1UNtJe)\n\n![image22.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWRTFVfkSTF9PmWPFM8BjJ4isc82fSnbHTkk996137V33)\n\n**Who is Conor Daly** Conor Daly is one of the most beloved figures in the American professional racing landscape – having competed in the NTT IndyCar Series, NASCAR (Cup Series, Xfinity and Truck Series), GP2 Series and Nitrocross, amongst other pursuits. Just as popular off the track, the Indiana-native appeared in Season 30 of The Amazing Race and has engaged in a variety of activities that have highlighted his social personality, including hosting the prominent motorsports podcast, Speed Street, as well as appearing in the 2024 NBA Celebrity All-Star Game in his home state.\n\nDaly is one of just 29 drivers in history to have raced in the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500 within the same year. With a tenth-place finish in 2019 and a sixth-place finish in 2022, he led most laps, was a pole sitter and finished on the podium at the Indy 500 in 2021. In 2023, he defied all odds to qualify for the NASCAR Cup Series’ Daytona 500, racing on Floyd Mayweather’s The Money Team (TMT) Racing. He also became the first driver to compete in both NASCAR and IndyCar on back-to-back Texas weekends. In 2024, Daly joined Niece Motorsports to drive the No. 44 Chevrolet Silverado, and competed in the NASCAR Xfinity Series at IMS driving the No. 26 Polkadot GR Supra for Sam Hunt Racing. The son of Formula One, CART and IMSA driver, Derek Daly, Conor started racing go-karts as a 10-year-old – grabbing two championships and Junior Driver of the Year recognition.\n\nConor Daly Ask Me Anything: [https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1ypKdpavPdqKW)\n\n**Who is Athelo Group** We’re an athlete-marketing agency built around one simple observation: When brands and athletes team up for an effective partnership, everyone wins.\n\nWe jumped at the opportunity to work with Conor since 2019 after being introduced to him by a fellow NASCAR client so we could help further immerse our agency in the world of IndyCar Driving while also allowing Conor to take advantage of our expertise. Since he has been involved in the racing scene for so long, he already had a great community around him. It was our job to step in to grow these existing connections in ways Conor might not have ever thought to before.\n\nWith our background in NASCAR and his insider knowledge of the Indianapolis racing scene, we hit the ground running to come up with creative ideas to leverage his value. We are currently working to find ways to enhance Conor’s relationships and negotiate new opportunities that will increase his brand awareness both on and off the track.\n\n[Athelo Group](https://athelogroup.com/) aims to bring partnerships to the table that align well with Conor’s personal brand. For instance, as a patient of Type 1 Diabetes, Conor is a vocal advocate for the diabetes community as well as the youth diabetes community since he has been living with this since his early adolescence. Conor has been working with Afrezza (MannKind) which is an inhalable insulin company that is leading the way globally in some of the most unique diabetes research around. Being at the forefront of something different but something that he is passionate about is a win / win for all parties involved while Conor still strives to lean into this partnership to learn more each and every day. We are also helping him branch out into the Esports community to look for opportunities there. We are excited to see how Conor continues to grow in his craft and honor the name of his family’s past racing tradition.\n\nCapabilities of Athelo Group > [Athelo Group Capabilities](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZWNSwL-zpj0ziKVyh9NGkYM4DwgzkAJ_/view?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "*Disclaimer*: This is not a funding / top-up proposal. The transfer of 0.22 DOT is a mere “stamp of approval” of the changes proposed below.\n\n*Disclaimer 2*: This referendum is posted under **Treasurer track** which is higher than the original track that created the bounty (High Spender)\n\nPAL is a community-driven initiative that aims to make Polkadot a safer and more attractive place for both builders and users by allocating funds from the Polkadot treasury ([bounty #22](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/22)) to advance security in Rust / Polkadot SDK. \n\nSince its creation, PAL has distributed **157,155 DOT** to co-fund **14 Rust security audits** of **11 Polkadot parachains**, helping secure **18 High-risk vulnerabilities** that may have resulted in loss of user funds (see [PAL Community Report H1 24)](https://github.com/polkadot-assurance-legion/pal-docs/blob/main/community-reports/pal-24h1.md).\n\nThis proposal aims to bring PAL into the next stage of its evolution by expanding the scope beyond “audits of parachains” towards a more holistic approach to Polkadot security. The expertise of the curators should be leveraged to review and - where appropriate - renegotiate security initiatives which would otherwise go directly to OpenGov. At the same time, this proposal tightens the maximum payouts (previously up to 18,000 DOT) and denominates the thresholds in a stable currency (USD).\n\nList of proposed changes including high-level limitations and rationale:\n\n* **Beyond parachains: Open eligibility to coretime consumers (audits)**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum 80% of the costs or up to $100,000 per chain and per 6 months. The criteria will be further specified and published by the curators.\n\n*Rationale*: The original eligibility criteria are confined to the definition of a parachain. This should be adjusted as Polkadot transitions into coretime. At the same time, curators will need to ensure that coretime consumers applying for funding are serious and trustworthy actors. This will be achieved through a combination of objective criteria and subjective judgment.\n\n* **Open eligibility to Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot (audits)**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum 50% of the costs or up to $50,000 per project and per 6 months. The criteria will be further specified and published by the curators.\n\n*Rationale*: The adoption of ink! has been lagging behind, and with the birth of Plaza we expect that the share of Solidity smart contracts in Polkadot will grow. The curators will need to ensure that the smart contracts applying for funding are trustworthy and will be deployed on Polkadot, and not elsewhere.\n\n* **Open eligibility to Polkadot relay chain and system chains (audits)**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum 80% of the costs, up to $100,000 per chain and per 6 months.\nThe criteria will be further specified and published by the curators.\n\n*Rationale*: Covering (a part of) the audits of the Polkadot relay chain and its system chains will increase the transparency and control by the community, allowing us to identify critical parts of the common infrastructure that require (further) auditing.\n\n* **Open eligibility to common-good security tooling**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum $250,000. If the application exceeds $50,000, it must be split into milestones and subsequent payouts will only be done after the previous milestone has been delivered.\n\n*Rationale*: As OpenGov funding requests for security tooling increase (example [here](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/942)), it makes sense to channel such requests through the PAL bounty and leverage the expertise of the curators who are better suited to give a judgment on the added value of the tooling and its costs relative to other security initiatives.\n\n* **Open eligibility to other common-good security initiatives**\n\n*Limitations*: Maximum $25,000 per use-case.\n\n*Rationale*: PAL Curators should have the discretion to spend limited resources towards common-good initiatives that do not fall in one of the categories mentioned above. For example, by making donations towards the reputable [SEAL](https://securityalliance.org/) cross-ecosystem initiative we could have a 911 hotline for victims dedicated to Polkadot, organize War Games (simulate attacks to train security response) or implement the Safe Harbour Agreement which provides guarantees to whitehats.\n\n* **Replace the curator fee (2%) with a monthly curator salary**\n\n*Limitations*: $3000 worth of DOT per curator per month.\n\n*Rationale*: The current fee mechanism has proven too limited to provide sufficient incentives for administering the bounty. For 8 months of work, each curator has received short of 500 DOT so far. To accommodate the current and future scope of work, this proposal converts the fee into a monthly salary ensuring that the curators will be incentivized to book at least one day per week to onboard security experts and thoroughly examine and renegotiate their applications.\n\n* **Add [Vincent Di Giambattista](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdigiambattista/) (Parity) as a PAL curator, replacing Dominik Harz**\n\nWith over 30 years of experience in the security field, Vince is currently the CISO at Parity leading the Security team to adapt the security posture of Parity and support to Polkadot in alignment with the evolution of the cyber threat landscape.\n\n* **Add Kirill Pimenov ([Kampela](https://www.kampe.la/)) as a PAL curator, replacing Hang Yin**\n\nHaving joined Parity in 2017 within a couple of weeks after the infamous “Ooops, I’ve accidentally killed it” hack, Kirill soon took charge of all things security at Parity, being Head of Security/CISO for almost 5 years. Currently Kirill runs his own hardware security startup, Kampela — and advises some other teams in the space on the topics of security and blockchain engineering in general.\n\n\n**Stay safu.**",

Adds an asset rate for DED, after 50 billion DED were sent to the Treasury account. The rate set is 1 DOT = 30,000 DED.\n2. Corrects the asset rates for USDT and USDC. The previous values were [set in 645](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/645) using the wrong encoding of the value. TLDR: My bad.\n3. Removes the asset rates for DOT. This was originally required when introducing multi-asset spends, since the logic needed a rate for everything (including DOT), but this has been fixed and spends in DOT _just work_.",

The idea of having a large crowd of curators reach a super majority to decide on specific projects seems to be ineffective. On the other hand I observe that bounties with a small set of curators that are highly experienced (like for example DeFi Bounty) seem to be extremely effective Hopefully some new leadership will take over this bounty or if not it's better to abandon it completely",

      "content": "This bounty has always been very criticized as ineffective and self-serving. I see no apparent reason why there should be a specific Spanish bounty, then we should also have a Chinese bounty, Indian Bounty, French bounty, etc. Most of the activities covered by this bounty are already covered by other bounties like events bounty, marketing bounty, etc with much better management and oversight. I think it's time to clean up this bounty because of its ineffectiveness and controversy in the ecosystem. We could also consider replacing the curators with more effective ones (I'm not saying that all of them are ineffective, I'm sure that some of them in the current bounty are very effective but they may be slowed down by ineffective ones, similar to old events bounty). I'm happy to have a conversation with the current curators to understand if this bounty can be salvaged or it's better to terminate it since anyway all the actions it is undertaking already exist under more generic bounties Instead of killing the bounty directly I am proposing to remove the curators so this is like a prelude to either replacing the curators or terminating the bounty in a second referendum",

What we learned is that there is a massive interest specifically in extraordinary events funding from all sides of the ecosystem.

This expansion of tasks has become a clear need since Parity’s decentralization, and we are identifying that our responsibility now includes funding event activations and almost all associated expenses that come with them, for the benefit of Polkadot’s long term image and impact at prominent industry events. \n\nAfter recurrent criticism from the community that fundamental issues are not addressed by the current setup of the bounty or response time by main curators, below proposed changes address that criticism in a productive way to move forward.\n\nBeyond requesting a top-up for the bounty and updating the rules, the proponents are requesting [a change of curators](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/758) in order to align with the new direction of the Events Bounty.\n\nAdditionally, the proponents have designed a novel system for removing curators in case they do not adhere to their duties. This is an ecosystem wide issue which makes it difficult to dismiss curators, and we hope that it will assist other bounties in their decision making process and organizational structure. \n\n### Events Bounty V3: Key Changes\n\n- Increase the curator set from 5 to 7 curators.\n- Reduce proposal review times.\n- Assign specific tasks to each curator.\n- Implement a mechanism to dismiss curators if they neglect their duties.\n- Clarify the vision for positioning Polkadot at global events.\n- New specific focuses on BD & speaker placement.\n- Introduction of “Fishermen” and “Advisor” roles.\n- Appoint dedicated  Events Bounty curators. \n\n\nPlease read the full proposal [here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jkS6vQon1JLKQX0yJ5d0-MiJz-_jIIKxPea-t8PkIGc/edit?usp=sharing)",

This proposal requests funding to incorporate the foundation and operate it for one year. |\n\n### Introduction\n\nThe Polkadot Community Foundation (the “Foundation”) is a proposed Foundation Company incorporated in the Cayman Islands whose activities will be directed by DOT holders via Polkadot OpenGov.\n\nMembers of the Polkadot community engaged Actum Node LLC, a consultancy that has been active in the ecosystem and working closely with Parity leadership for the past two years, to design a legal entity that could serve as a real-world extension of the existing on-chain Polkadot governance process. Together with a team of community members, legal and industry advisors, Actum Node explored a range of possible legal, governance, and operational factors to design and propose this Foundation.\n\nThe work has already been done to design the governance, draft the bylaws, recruit the staff and directors, and refine the plans with some active members of the community. Barring any significant feedback, the Foundation can incorporate and begin operations immediately following the vote and enactment period.\n\nApproving this proposal would extend the types of proposals that Polkadot governance is able to enact beyond purely on-chain actions to include “real world” activities that require human actions, legal identity, and/or analog assets to execute.\n\nUnlike many other blockchain foundations, the Polkadot treasury will remain on-chain under the direction of OpenGov, and will not be subsumed by the Foundation. This proposal requests only enough DOT to incorporate the Foundation and operate it with a minimal scope for 12 months. As the community thinks about how it would like to utilize the Foundation, it can vote on future treasury proposals to expand the scope and fund those activities.\n\n### Background\n\nDecentralized protocols and organizations increasingly require a bridge between the analog, centralized world and a more fully digital and decentralized future, while complying with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn the past, there has been a large reliance on the Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies to advance the ecosystem off-chain. While those organizations are philosophically aligned to the health and growth of Polkadot, their corporate governance structures offer no formal role or rights to DOT holders (nor are they in a good position to do so).\n\nAs Polkadot evolves to [further decentralize governance](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-gov2), and as Parity and the Web3 Foundation look to [turn over critical functions to the community](https://x.com/paritytech/status/1711752658430652548?s=20), it will benefit from a legal entity to effectuate Polkadot community governance in the “real world.”\n\nThe Polkadot Community Foundation is designed to explicitly represent and serve DOT holders’ interests off-chain. Its governing documents grant DOT holders permanent, irrevocable rights to guide its activities and oversee significant matters through the existing on-chain Polkadot OpenGov system.\n\n### Activities\n\nThe Foundation will take on activities delegated to it by Polkadot governance. The community will likely discover and evolve its thinking over time about which activities are best delegated to the Foundation, but as a rule of thumb, any activity that is best served with a legal contract, that requires fiat payments or physical presence, or that requires active project management is appropriate for the Foundation to execute on the community’s behalf.\n\nInitially, the Foundation will have a minimal scope to:\n\n-   Create and maintain a compliant off-chain organization capable of acting on directives from the community,\n-   Taking custody of accounts, logins, keys, and assets as a form of community ownership,\n-   Executing contract agreements with partners, vendors, and service providers.\n\nAdditional activities that require additional resources for project management, capital expenditures, business development, technical development, etc., will likely require incremental budget, staff, and/or legal design, which can be provisioned through subsequent line-item OpenGov treasury proposals. This allows the Foundation to adapt and grow to suit the community’s directives as they become concrete.\n\nSome hypothetical future activities that the community may consider delegating to the Foundation can include:\n\n-   Retail marketing activities, e.g. social ad campaigns targeting developers\n-   Educational programs, e.g. Polkadot Blockchain Academy\n-   Complex grants programs, e.g. tranched or actively managed awards tied to milestones\n-   Community events, e.g. contracting with venues and service providers for physical gatherings\n-   Code management, e.g. maintain the polkadot-js GitHub repo\n\nAs the community gains interest in various use cases, it can direct the Foundation to explore them in greater depth and report on how it might be able to execute them.\n\n### Entity Design\n\nThe proposed structure incorporates several features designed to optimize across trust, risk, and efficiency. It balances community representation with professional robustness, minimizes the treasury assets at risk, maximizes ability to adjust and evolve over time, and allows each proposed activity to be evaluated on its merits.\n\n### Corporate Structure\n\nCayman Islands foundation companies offer a unique way to assign important rights to a broader stakeholder pool beyond traditional shareholders, directors, and employees. This proposal uses that feature to give DOT holders significant oversight and important powers to ensure that the Foundation carries out its business appropriately.\n\n**Memberless:** There are no members or shareholders who hold an economic claim over the Foundation. This eliminates a common source of conflict between legal entities and the communities they serve.\n\n**Supervisor:** There is a supervisor role, whose primary purpose is to oversee the Board of Directors and ensure that the Foundation’s governing documents are upheld. The supervisor holds legal standing to act on behalf of the foundation in the event that directors diverge from their commitments or fail in their fiduciary duties. Given that the governing documents specifically instruct the directors to respect tokenholder preferences, provide adequate transparency, and not dilute the rights given to tokenholders, the Supervisor acts as a direct safeguard for tokenholder interests.\n\n**Directors:** The Foundation will have a five member Board of Directors, divided between:\n\n-   A three director majority served by Cayman resident professional governance service providers to ensure the Foundation is sufficiently independent of other entities in the Polkadot ecosystem and to comply with Cayman Islands economic substance requirements.\n-   Two seats reserved for future directors to be appointed by Polkadot governance, to ensure tokenholder interests are fully represented and considered in all matters.\n\n**Staff & Administration:** Day-to-day administration will be outsourced to a Cayman Islands based professional services firm, reporting to the Board of Directors. These needs may fluctuate over time depending on the scope of activities delegated to the Foundation, and the Foundation will maintain flexibility to add to, modify, and redirect the administrative staff as needed. The administrator’s duties include: -\n\n-   Operational support and project management\n-   Engaging and managing corporate service providers including legal and bookkeeping\n-   Actively engaging and collaborating with the community to help craft, review, and execute governance proposals for Foundation activities\n-   Maintaining appropriate documentation and transparency reports, and\n-   Ensuring legal and regulatory compliance under applicable law\n\n**DOT Holder Rights:**. The Foundation’s bylaws ensure special voting rights and protections for DOT tokenholders, including: - Polkadot OpenGov treasury proposals are the Foundation’s funding source, so DOT holders can choose to withhold future funding to cover basic operating expenses if they are unhappy with the Foundation.\n\n-   Delegating specific activities to the Foundation. These activities are to be approved as referenda through on-chain Polkadot governance via OpenGov, using any track with adequate spending permissions. If approved, the Foundation’s Directors will review approved referenda and if they are appropriate and actionable, then the Foundation will execute the requested activities.\n-   The tokenholder-appointed Directors have full access to represent tokenholders’ interests in all matters, and may notify the Supervisor and/or the community of any improprieties.\n-   Tokenholders can vote via Polkadot OpenGov’s General Admin track to remove the Supervisor or Directors who are not serving appropriately.\n-   Tokenholders can vote via Polkadot OpenGov’s General Admin track to amend the Foundation’s bylaws.\n-   A requirement that the Foundation cannot agree to any deliverables, responsibilities, or payments to third parties unless they have been pre-approved by tokenholders.\n-   A requirement that the Foundation make public transparency reports detailing the Foundation’s activities, including but not limited to transactions, proposal status, and ongoing efforts to carry out approved proposals.\n-   Tokenholders can vote via Polkadot OpenGov’s General Admin track to wind up the Foundation or instruct it to transfer some or all of its assets to another charitable object.\n\n### Draft Documents\n\nHere are full drafts of the Foundation’s governance documents, which will be used to incorporate the Polkadot Community Foundation if this proposal passes.\n\n-   [Draft Bylaws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yrq5mAquY2pPW5ZBnl07Xt7Woj-HwGJd/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109408449182956936927&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n-   [Draft Articles of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tvWEuSU4JzrShNE_HR9p0cBiiQSGQ4dJ/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109408449182956936927&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n-   [Draft Memorandum of Association](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rG6crLnwkXsl6hM-BsnmXpaTT9IfefQY/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109408449182956936927&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n### Initial Personnel\n\nActum Node interviewed several candidates for each role, including referrals from the above-mentioned law firms, and members of the Polkadot community, and selected the following to propose as the initial office holders.\n\nPlease note that some of the candidates requested that their names and backgrounds be partially redacted in public internet posts to prevent spam and phishing vectors that could compromise themselves or the Foundation. We extended the same level of privacy to all of the candidates for the same reasons.\n\n**Supervisor:**\n\nJ. Bain is a career fiduciary services professional. He has a regulatory background, having previously worked at the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority, and he has significant experience overseeing DAO foundations, other crypto-related entities, and traditional investment fund entities. Mr. Bain was introduced by our Cayman Islands counsel and recommended by the CEO of a crypto investment firm that he governs.\n\n**Directors:**\n\nG. Kennedy is an experienced governance professional. He has a legal background, having served as General Counsel and outside counsel to several Cayman and European investment funds, and he sits on the board of several blockchain-related companies and foundations. Mr. Kennedy was introduced by our Cayman Islands counsel and strongly recommended by the General Counsel of an L1 development company and the CEO of a decentralized identity protocol where he also serves.\n\nM. Shaw is an experienced governance professional. He is a serial finance entrepreneur, having founded a DeFi protocol, a digital asset management company, and a data analytics company, among others. He has a finance background with a focus on global markets. Mr. Shaw was introduced by the proposed Supervisor J Bain and strongly recommended by the Managing Director of a crypto investment firm where he holds a director seat.\n\nE. Noyons is an experienced governance professional. He has an accounting background from a “big four” firm and is a member of the Cayman Islands Institute of Professional Accountants. Mr. Noyons was introduced by our Cayman Islands counsel and strongly recommended by the COO of an NFT Gaming company where he holds a director seat.\n\nTwo vacant seats, which Polkadot governance and only Polkadot governance can vote to fill at any time.\n\n**Administrator:**\n\n[Autonomous Projects](https://autonomousprojects.co/) is a team of professionals based in the Cayman Islands with a collective 30+ years of web3 industry experience spanning legal, regulatory, finance, operations and investment management. This includes working with clients across the asset management and web3 spectrum including Layer 1’s, Layer 2’s and other scaling solutions, DeFi, infrastructure, gaming and NFTs across multiple different blockchains where we support our clients in the development, implementation, maintenance, support and upgrade of their day-to-day operations layered with a keen understanding of the Cayman Islands legal and regulatory landscape.\n\nAfter a competitive process, Autonomous was selected for their previous experience working with the Polkadot ecosystem, their emphasis on sound financial & back office management, and their flexibility to adapt as the Foundation’s operations evolve.\n\n### Budget\n\nFor the scope outlined above including establishment of the Foundation and one year of base operations, the requested budget is $600,000.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | ---: |\n| **Staff & administrative services** |     |\n| Administration | $196,200 |\n| **Directors & corporate services** |     |\n| Directors (x5) | $175,000 |\n| Supervisor | $7,500 |\n| Corporate Secretary | $3,500 |\n| Registered Office | $2,500 |\n| **General & Administrative** |     |\n| Legal | $120,000 |\n| AML Compliance | $10,000 |\n| Filings & Audits | $2,000 |\n| Insurance | $40,000 |\n| Software & Web Hosting | $5,000 |\n| Miscellaneous | $38,300 |\n| Project-specific expenses | TBD by future treasury proposals |\n| **12 MONTHS BUDGET REQUEST** | **$600,000** |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nAll of the necessary documents have been drafted and the team is in place to incorporate the Foundation immediately following the vote and enactment period.\n\nThe requested funds will be released to a “transition team” multisig. Once established, the Foundation will share relevant documents and information with the community to verify that the foundation was set up appropriately, and the funds will be released from the transition team to the Foundation’s control.\n\n### FAQ\n\n**Why a Cayman Foundation Company and not a Swiss Foundation?**\n\nA Swiss Foundation structure is a valid option for this entity, but the Cayman structure offers greater operational ease and flexibility. Swiss Foundations are subject to income tax by default unless government authorities explicitly grant exceptions, which come with certain requirements. In contrast, Cayman Foundation Companies are tax exempt by default.\n\n**Can this Foundation service Kusama as well?**\n\nAs the Foundation reserves certain rights and powers for tokenholders, it is unclear how the combination of DOT and KSM holders, with differing governance instances, can jointly indicate their preferences.\n\nAfter gathering input from key members of the Polkadot community and legal counsel, we suggest moving forward with a Foundation to serve only DOT holders initially. Later as a separate initiative we can consider creating a similar but separate foundation to serve KSM holders, and perhaps even help facilitate the creation of similar foundations for any parachain or DAO in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Can we reduce the budget?**\n\nWe believe the proposed budget is as close to a bare minimum as possible, while governance and operations are compliant, redundant, and professional-quality. Some other foundations are set up with a single director and no administrator, but we don’t believe that setup would be suitable for this Foundation’s goals.\n\n**How does this foundation shield tokenholders and governance participants from liability?**\n\nIf someone were to make a legal claim that an Polkadot OpenGov action harmed them in some way, everyone who participated in governance may be liable. However, if the action was taken by a legal entity with limited liability, like the Polkadot Community Foundation, then it may be held liable but it absorbs the risk and shields the liability of governance participants and tokenholders. This is an advantage of routing activities through the Foundation.\n\n**How will tokenholders know if the foundation is doing what it’s supposed to?**\n\nTokenholders can appoint 2 of the 5 directors and the supervisor. The idea is that this lets them choose known people who share their values and are committed to Polkadot to gain full access to everything happening inside the foundation, and ability to represent the tokenholders in all decisions.\n\nThe bylaws also require quarterly public transparency reports. Over time that can mature to become robust real-time reporting if a) the foundation team does that proactively, b) if tokenholders provide additional funding and explicit instructions to enable real-time reporting, or c) if tokenholders vote to amend the bylaws to require real-time reporting.\n\n**How do we avoid service providers or directors turning passive or amassing power over time?**\n\nAny service provider, director, or supervisor can be removed by a vote of tokenholders at any time. In the future, the community could decide to implement a seat rotation, term limits, or other measures to reduce the risk of bureaucratic power. These are not provisioned in the current proposal but can be decided via a proposal on the Polkadot OpenGov General Admin track at any time.\n\n**Can a director just spend the foundation’s money however they want?**\n\nNo. This will depend somewhat on the operating policies the foundation team puts into place, like how many people have to approve/sign any expenditures, if small expenditures are pre-authorized, etc. As with any traditional company, it is technically possible for someone to spend money they’re not supposed to. But ultimately, there are several types of recourse if this were to happen.\n\nIf a service provider spends money in a way that wasn’t authorized by the directors, then the service provider is likely in breach of their contract and subject to legal actions. If a director spends money that wasn’t properly authorized by the board, then the other directors or the supervisor can take action. If they don’t, then the tokenholders can replace them with someone who will.\n\nFinally, the design of this Foundation as an option, with funding coming only as-needed, minimizes the funds at risk and ensures the Foundation stays reliant on community trust.\n\n**What if there’s a bad actor?**\n\nWe built redundant checks and balances into the governance system. No one person, and no one layer of governance is immune. In addition, we selected professional governance professionals for each role, whose businesses rely heavily on maintaining a good reputation.Ultimately, all trails end with the tokenholders’ ability to fire people, withhold budget, or dissolve the foundation in case of any extreme events.\n\n**Who can fire a director?**\n\nThe bylaws allow two ways for a director to be fired. By a director vote, or by a tokenholder vote via the OpenGov General Admin track.What if the directors collude?\n\nColluding directors would have to do so in full sight of the tokenholder-appointed directors and the supervisor. If all of those people were colluding, then the tokenholders could remove them all, withhold budget, or dissolve the foundation.\n\n**Who can appoint a Cayman Professional director after one has been removed?**\n\nThe 3 director seats that are not tokenholder-appointed are filled by a director vote, meaning all the seats that are currently filled including both those appointed by tokenholders and those who are not. If for some reason there are ever no active directors then the supervisor can appoint one as a backstop.\n\nTechnically, these seats that are not tokenholder-appointed do not always have to be filled by Cayman professionals, but the advice we received is that having a majority based in the Cayman Islands is an important tax and regulatory consideration.\n\n**Can the tokenholders sue?**\n\nPotentially, but coordination to prove those bringing suit represent “the tokenholders” as a class would likely be difficult, costly, and require doxing themselves.\n\nHowever, the supervisor is a unique role in Cayman Foundation Companies with legal standing to sue directors who violate the Foundation’s governing documents. Those documents instruct the directors to respect tokenholder preferences. If tokenholders ever feel that the supervisor is not acting appropriately, they can remove and replace the supervisor at any time by approving a proposal to do so on Polkadot OpenGov’s General Admin track.",

Shaw is an experienced governance professional. He is a serial finance entrepreneur, having founded a DeFi protocol, a digital asset management company, and a data analytics company, among others. He has a finance background with a focus on global markets. Mr. Shaw was introduced by the proposed Supervisor J Bain and strongly recommended by the Managing Director of a crypto investment firm where he holds a director seat.\n\nE. Noyons is an experienced governance professional. He has an accounting background from a “big four” firm and is a member of the Cayman Islands Institute of Professional Accountants. Mr. Noyons was introduced by our Cayman Islands counsel and strongly recommended by the COO of an NFT Gaming company where he holds a director seat.\n\nTwo vacant seats, which Polkadot governance and only Polkadot governance can vote to fill at any time.\n\n**Administrator:**\n\n[Autonomous Projects](https://autonomousprojects.co/) is a team of professionals based in the Cayman Islands with a collective 30+ years of web3 industry experience spanning legal, regulatory, finance, operations and investment management. This includes working with clients across the asset management and web3 spectrum including Layer 1’s, Layer 2’s and other scaling solutions, DeFi, infrastructure, gaming and NFTs across multiple different blockchains where we support our clients in the development, implementation, maintenance, support and upgrade of their day-to-day operations layered with a keen understanding of the Cayman Islands legal and regulatory landscape.\n\nAfter a competitive process, Autonomous was selected for their previous experience working with the Polkadot ecosystem, their emphasis on sound financial & back office management, and their flexibility to adapt as the Foundation’s operations evolve.\n\n### Budget\n\nFor the scope outlined above including establishment of the Foundation and one year of base operations, the requested budget is $600,000.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | ---: |\n| **Staff & administrative services** |     |\n| Administration | $196,200 |\n| **Directors & corporate services** |     |\n| Directors (x5) | $175,000 |\n| Supervisor | $7,500 |\n| Corporate Secretary | $3,500 |\n| Registered Office | $2,500 |\n| **General & Administrative** |     |\n| Legal | $120,000 |\n| AML Compliance | $10,000 |\n| Filings & Audits | $2,000 |\n| Insurance | $40,000 |\n| Software & Web Hosting | $5,000 |\n| Miscellaneous | $38,300 |\n| Project-specific expenses | TBD by future treasury proposals |\n| **12 MONTHS BUDGET REQUEST** | **$600,000** |\n\n### Next Steps\n\nAll of the necessary documents have been drafted and the team is in place to incorporate the Foundation immediately following the vote and enactment period.\n\nThe requested funds will be released to a “transition team” multisig. Once established, the Foundation will share relevant documents and information with the community to verify that the foundation was set up appropriately, and the funds will be released from the transition team to the Foundation’s control.\n\n### FAQ\n\n**Why a Cayman Foundation Company and not a Swiss Foundation?**\n\nA Swiss Foundation structure is a valid option for this entity, but the Cayman structure offers greater operational ease and flexibility. Swiss Foundations are subject to income tax by default unless government authorities explicitly grant exceptions, which come with certain requirements. In contrast, Cayman Foundation Companies are tax exempt by default.\n\n**Can this Foundation service Kusama as well?**\n\nAs the Foundation reserves certain rights and powers for tokenholders, it is unclear how the combination of DOT and KSM holders, with differing governance instances, can jointly indicate their preferences.\n\nAfter gathering input from key members of the Polkadot community and legal counsel, we suggest moving forward with a Foundation to serve only DOT holders initially. Later as a separate initiative we can consider creating a similar but separate foundation to serve KSM holders, and perhaps even help facilitate the creation of similar foundations for any parachain or DAO in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Can we reduce the budget?**\n\nWe believe the proposed budget is as close to a bare minimum as possible, while governance and operations are compliant, redundant, and professional-quality. Some other foundations are set up with a single director and no administrator, but we don’t believe that setup would be suitable for this Foundation’s goals.\n\n**How does this foundation shield tokenholders and governance participants from liability?**\n\nIf someone were to make a legal claim that an Polkadot OpenGov action harmed them in some way, everyone who participated in governance may be liable. However, if the action was taken by a legal entity with limited liability, like the Polkadot Community Foundation, then it may be held liable but it absorbs the risk and shields the liability of governance participants and tokenholders. This is an advantage of routing activities through the Foundation.\n\n**How will tokenholders know if the foundation is doing what it’s supposed to?**\n\nTokenholders can appoint 2 of the 5 directors and the supervisor. The idea is that this lets them choose known people who share their values and are committed to Polkadot to gain full access to everything happening inside the foundation, and ability to represent the tokenholders in all decisions.\n\nThe bylaws also require quarterly public transparency reports. Over time that can mature to become robust real-time reporting if a) the foundation team does that proactively, b) if tokenholders provide additional funding and explicit instructions to enable real-time reporting, or c) if tokenholders vote to amend the bylaws to require real-time reporting.\n\n**How do we avoid service providers or directors turning passive or amassing power over time?**\n\nAny service provider, director, or supervisor can be removed by a vote of tokenholders at any time. In the future, the community could decide to implement a seat rotation, term limits, or other measures to reduce the risk of bureaucratic power. These are not provisioned in the current proposal but can be decided via a proposal on the Polkadot OpenGov General Admin track at any time.\n\n**Can a director just spend the foundation’s money however they want?**\n\nNo. This will depend somewhat on the operating policies the foundation team puts into place, like how many people have to approve/sign any expenditures, if small expenditures are pre-authorized, etc. As with any traditional company, it is technically possible for someone to spend money they’re not supposed to. But ultimately, there are several types of recourse if this were to happen.\n\nIf a service provider spends money in a way that wasn’t authorized by the directors, then the service provider is likely in breach of their contract and subject to legal actions. If a director spends money that wasn’t properly authorized by the board, then the other directors or the supervisor can take action. If they don’t, then the tokenholders can replace them with someone who will.\n\nFinally, the design of this Foundation as an option, with funding coming only as-needed, minimizes the funds at risk and ensures the Foundation stays reliant on community trust.\n\n**What if there’s a bad actor?**\n\nWe built redundant checks and balances into the governance system. No one person, and no one layer of governance is immune. In addition, we selected professional governance professionals for each role, whose businesses rely heavily on maintaining a good reputation.Ultimately, all trails end with the tokenholders’ ability to fire people, withhold budget, or dissolve the foundation in case of any extreme events.\n\n**Who can fire a director?**\n\nThe bylaws allow two ways for a director to be fired. By a director vote, or by a tokenholder vote via the OpenGov General Admin track.What if the directors collude?\n\nColluding directors would have to do so in full sight of the tokenholder-appointed directors and the supervisor. If all of those people were colluding, then the tokenholders could remove them all, withhold budget, or dissolve the foundation.\n\n**Who can appoint a Cayman Professional director after one has been removed?**\n\nThe 3 director seats that are not tokenholder-appointed are filled by a director vote, meaning all the seats that are currently filled including both those appointed by tokenholders and those who are not. If for some reason there are ever no active directors then the supervisor can appoint one as a backstop.\n\nTechnically, these seats that are not tokenholder-appointed do not always have to be filled by Cayman professionals, but the advice we received is that having a majority based in the Cayman Islands is an important tax and regulatory consideration.\n\n**Can the tokenholders sue?**\n\nPotentially, but coordination to prove those bringing suit represent “the tokenholders” as a class would likely be difficult, costly, and require doxing themselves.\n\nHowever, the supervisor is a unique role in Cayman Foundation Companies with legal standing to sue directors who violate the Foundation’s governing documents. Those documents instruct the directors to respect tokenholder preferences. If tokenholders ever feel that the supervisor is not acting appropriately, they can remove and replace the supervisor at any time by approving a proposal to do so on Polkadot OpenGov’s General Admin track.",

          "content": "With this proposal I propose to terminate events bounty. Events bounty has always been very problematic and I have received so many complaints by so many organizers of events that are completely discouraged. The issue is not that the bounty rejects certain proposals which would be perfectly okay, the issue is that it seems that it takes even 2 weeks just to receive a comment. There have been many promises of changes or improvement but those never happen even by changing the curators. The rationale for terminating the bounty is that some people vote on principle and vote against events arguing that they should go to events bounty. But going to events bounty implies losing a lot of time often just to get rejected which will compromise the event itself. If the events bounty was able to at least reject within one week it would be perfect so one could go to referendum after rejection but they're also slow to reject so basically this could compromise events. We have a specific case where for example DV Halikon voted against a very successful event, the one that just happened in Dubai, just on principle arguing you should go to events bounty. Of course every organizer knows that going to events bounty would have led to just canceling the event. But unfortunately because of his vote the proposal missed the spending period and basically the organizer had to advance the funds out of his own pocket which I personally think is unacceptable and is going to discourage a lot of people from organizing events. So I argue that it is much better for events bounty not to exist to avoid having certain voters voting no to event referendums arguing that they should go to events bounty.",

Spender tracks. It does this using the Asset Rate pallet.\n\nThis proposal creates three asset rates, one for DOT itself and two for USDT and USDC (each). The rate of DOT to DOT is 1, obviously. For USDT and USDC, I propose setting the rate to 10 USD(X). This is represented as `1000` in the proposal. Note that the rate does not affect the amount that gets paid out by a proposal, only the evaluation of the track permissions.\n\nAs an example, a submitter makes a proposal for 100 USDT. This would convert to 10 DOT, and the dispatch mechanism would ensure that the track (e.g. `SmallSpender`) can spend up to 10 DOT.\n\nAlthough this asset rate is set manually now, in the not-too-distant future we will be able to have the Asset Conversion pallet regularly report current ratios and have these rates update autonomously. This proposal is really meant to get us started and unlock USD(X) Treasury proposals.\n\nA note on how to arrive at 1,000:\n\n- 1 DOT = 10,000,000,000 units\n- 1 USDX = 1,000,000 units (i.e. 6 decimals)\n- 10,000,000 USDX units (10 USDX) = 10,000,000,000 DOT units (1 DOT)\n- Drop a lot of zeros...\n- == 1 / 1,000",

There’s an incredible amount of detail that can be found in the docs below. Please review them to find all relevant information regarding this program. Thanks! Note: this referendum configuration is inspired by referendum 323 on Kusama. The way the call is configured allows OpenGov to only vote once on the establishment of the bounty and curator. We must learn from Kusama!",

This referendum is being submitted ahead of the passing of referendum 363 as we would like to have the Curator in place around the end of January to facilitate timely payouts for said period.\n\nThe proposed curators are:\n\n- FrankyWild (frankywild#8573)\n- Tim Jansen (Tim Janssen (Won't DM)#8682)\n- Husni (pastaMan#9738)\n\nThe multi-sig will require 2/3 signatures and is configured as a pure-proxy. These individuals are members of the System Parachain Collator bounty on Kusama.  They have also met the requirements as described within section 5.2 of the [original proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2T1Nx90HkSAYF_CaOPLG-o3LS7h_QAa2WLDdcSJMs0/edit?usp=sharing) have been executing their responsibilities with diligence.\n\nRegards,",

Associated with this are several unlocks of deposits including those associated with Treasury Spend Proposals.  There are already several teams who have requested immediate return of their deposits via tips or spend proposals on OpenGov or tips on Gov 1.0.  \n\nThis referendum seeks to reduce the number of refund requests and prevent double spends by:\n\n- Slashing treasury deposits already returned to proposers \n- Slashing treasury deposits for proposers who have pending OpenGov proposals requesting or incorporating same\n- Slashing Gov 1.0 tips and treasury deposits for applicable proposers. The proposers would have their treasury funding and tip deposit returns to their respective accounts\n- Treasury deposits would be slashed and refunded to all those not matching the criteria to any of the above\n\nThe list of recipients was determined with collaboration with Otar who been keeping track of such refunds.  \n\nRegards,\n \n",
