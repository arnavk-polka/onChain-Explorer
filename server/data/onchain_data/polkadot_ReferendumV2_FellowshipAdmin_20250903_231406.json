      "content": "Hey, I'm Bastian Köcher, a rank 6 Fellowship member. The Fellowship requires that members up to rank 6 apply for retention to stay at their rank; otherwise, they can be downgraded. Normally, these referendums are done within the Fellowship itself. To retain rank X, members of rank X+2 need to vote in favor of you. In my case, there are no members of rank 8+ who could vote for me. So, I need to use the Fellowship track to get approval from all the token holders.\n\nAt rank 6, I need to request retention every 6 months. This retention is for the time frame from March 2025 until September 2025.\n\nMy main focus is still on bringing `500ms` blocks (also known as `BastiBlocks`) to parachains. The feature development is mostly finished, and I’ve already started merging parts of it ([PR6137](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/6137), [PR8172](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/8172), [PR9002](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/9002)) into the `master` branch of the Polkadot SDK. I’m splitting the feature into multiple smaller pull requests to make the review process easier. The MVP development is done, and now it’s mainly about getting the feature ported to `master`. It should land on test networks around the end of the year.\n\nOn May 23, we were informed about a potential security vulnerability in Polkadot. I did the initial investigation, developed a fix, and helped [publish a release](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/releases/tag/v1.5.1) that addressed the issue, all on the same day. It was a critical bug that allowed anyone to stall the relay chain or parachains by sending a simple transaction. For more details, [read the postmortem](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2025-05-23-polkadot-sdk-transaction-depth-limit/13248).\n\nBesides my development work, I also gave a presentation about CorePlay [at Protocol Berg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfihFE2M5hA). CorePlay is an idea for a JAM service that will allow developers to write actor-like programs on-chain.\n\nI'm often involved in discussions with builders/users in various public channels like Element, [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/u/bkchr/summary), or [Stackexchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/users/73/bkchr) to help solve their issues.\n\nBesides the work highlighted above, I'm also very active in maintaining the [Fellowship runtimes repo](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/created_by/bkchr) by providing reviews, helping with releases, and proposing changes of my own. I'm also very active when it comes to on-chain voting in the Fellowship, such as opening retention and promotion proposals for many members. I have taken part in one in-person interview to promote Sebastian Kunert from rank two to rank three (the rank of a member, the first rank in which they get actual voting rights in the Fellowship).\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Hey, I'm Bastian Köcher, a rank 6 Fellowship member. The Fellowship requires that members up to rank 6 apply for retention to stay at their rank; otherwise, they can be downgraded. Normally, these referendums are done within the Fellowship itself. To retain rank X, members of rank X+2 need to vote in favor of you. In my case, there are no members of rank 8+ who could vote for me. So, I need to use the Fellowship track to get approval from all the token holders.\n\nAt rank 6, I need to request retention every 6 months. This retention is for the time frame from October 2024 until March 2025.\n\nRight now, my main focus lies on enabling parachains to build blocks faster than the relay chain block time. When parachains launched, they were able to build blocks every `12s` (i.e., every second relay chain block). With asynchronous backing, the block time of parachains went down to `6s`. With elastic scaling, it will be possible to use multiple cores on Polkadot (each core provides `2s` of execution and `5MiB` of data). Thus, a parachain could use 3 cores on Polkadot to produce blocks every `2s`. The solution I'm working on will make it possible to build blocks every `500ms` by splitting one proof of validation (`PoV`) into multiple smaller pieces. By building blocks every `500ms`, the latency of applications on top of Polkadot will be reduced.\n\nBesides working on faster block times, I have been working on supporting [remote proxies](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/535). Right now, proxies are local (and thus limited) to chains. So, if a user creates a proxy on the relay chain, this proxy cannot be used on a parachain. For normal proxies, this is not such a big problem because they can be replicated manually. However, when a user creates a pure proxy, it cannot be replicated without `root`. We have recently seen this issue popping up. People created proposals on Polkadot to get paid in stables to their pure proxy accounts. The stables are paid out on AssetHub, and if the given pure proxy doesn't exist on AssetHub, the funds are not accessible. I created [a guide](https://blog.kchr.de/polkadot/guides/force-create-a-pure-proxy-account/) on how to replicate these pure proxies between chains, but this is a manual process that requires `root` and is cumbersome. So, I implemented a pallet that will enable users to use their proxies across different chains. I explained how these proxies work in [this blog post](https://blog.kchr.de/ecosystem-proxy/).\n\nBack in October, I wrote [RFC#123](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/123) to fix some longstanding issues around runtime upgrades in the Polkadot ecosystem. The problem only arises in the block that enacts a runtime upgrade. The runtime of a Substrate-based chain is stored in its own chain as a WASM binary. So, when the runtime is upgraded, this entry in the state is overwritten. When trying to read the state of the block that enacted the runtime upgrade, right now we are using the new WASM binary to decode the state entries. As the state layout can change with a runtime upgrade, the decoding may fail, and incorrect data is returned. In September last year, we saw [degraded parachain performance](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2024-09-17-polkadot-finality-lag-slow-parachain-production-immediately-after-runtime-upgrade-post-mortem/10057) after a runtime upgrade on the relay chain because of this issue.\n\nI'm often involved in discussions with builders/users in various public channels like Element, [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/u/bkchr/summary), or [Stackexchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/users/73/bkchr) to help solve their issues.\n\nBesides the work highlighted above, I'm also very active in maintaining the [Fellowship runtimes repo](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/created_by/bkchr) by providing reviews, helping with releases, and proposing changes of my own. I'm also very active when it comes to on-chain voting in the Fellowship, such as opening retention and promotion proposals for many members. I have taken part in three in-person interviews to promote people from rank two to rank three (the rank of a member, the first rank in which they get actual voting rights in the Fellowship).\n\nThank you!",

The community has been broadly supportive of the programme, however, based on the recent events, I believe that the current collective has failed in its duties. A reset is needed\nFurthermore, in reference to 1195, the Fellowship has invested considerable time and effort in getting the current programme up and running, and eliminating it entirely would undermine these efforts. The programme itself has not failed\n",

      "title": "Proposal to Demote Don Diego Sanchez as Head Ambassador",
      "content": "I am writing to address a series of serious incidents that I believe constitute significant violations of our code of conduct. As Head Ambassadors, we are expected to represent the Polkadot brand with the highest level of professionalism and integrity, we must take swift action to put our own house in order before society and law enforcement are compelled to intervene. Unfortunately, Don Diego Sanchez’s recent actions have failed to meet this standard, and his continued presence in this leadership position risks damaging the reputation of the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Incident Overview:**\n\n``1.`` **Inappropriate Behavior on Social Media:** On August 24th, Don Diego Sanchez posted a tweet [link to tweet](https://x.com/SanchezCrypto/status/1827443054296625272) containing derogatory language, inappropriate emojis, and tags to major financial institutions, including Deutsche Bank, BBVA, and Banco Santander, compromising the reputation of the entire Ambassadors team.\nThis unprofessional and public behavior goes against the values we uphold as Head Ambassadors of Polkadot. Not only does it tarnish our credibility, but it also jeopardizes relationships with key players in the financial sector, with potentially long-lasting consequences for the ecosystem.\n\n``2.`` **Misrepresentation and Malicious Intent:** Even more concerning is Don Diego’s deliberate misrepresentation regarding his proposal. He falsely claimed that, if approved, **four companies** would bring significant Business Development (BD) and marketing efforts to the Polkadot ecosystem. One of these companies, **Onyze**, is a firm with which I have a close personal relationship, allowing me to provide irrefutable evidence of falsehood in his claims.\n\nDon Diego represents **Scorechain** in this proposal. After his misleading post, Scorechain personnel contacted the CEO of Onyze via email, requesting support for marketing and BD. The CEO of Onyze **explicitly rejected this request**, and this rejection occurred after the post had already been made. Despite knowing that Onyze had declined to support the proposal, Don Diego and his team have continued to present this false information without any corrections or edits to the post—**even to this day**.\n\nThis act of dishonesty is particularly egregious for someone in a leadership role. Don Diego knowingly lied to push forward his agenda, even after receiving a direct rejection from one of the companies he cited. His ongoing refusal to correct this information demonstrates a malicious intent to deceive both the Polkadot community and stakeholders.\n\n**Violation of Code of Conduct:**\n\nDon Diego’s actions clearly breach several core principles outlined in Polkadot’s code of conduct and the tenets of the Polkadot Fellowship:\n\n``1.`` **Disrespecting Colleagues and the Community:**  His false accusations and offensive language have damaged internal and external relationships, eroding trust within the community.\n``2.`` **Reputational Damage:** Publicly implicating financial institutions and fellow ambassadors in inappropriate ways risks long-term harm to Polkadot’s reputation and its strategic partnerships.\n``3.`` **Deliberate Misrepresentation:**  Intentionally spreading false information to manipulate a proposal's success is a serious breach of ethical standards. This behavior is malicious and directly contradicts the role of a Head Ambassador, whose duty is to act in the best interests of the ecosystem.\n\n**Proposed Actions:**\n\nGiven the gravity of these incidents, I propose the following immediate actions:\n\n``1.`` **Immediate Demotion of Don Diego Sanchez from the Position of Head Ambassador:**  His actions demonstrate a clear lack of integrity, professionalism, and respect for the responsibilities entrusted to him. He should be immediately removed from this leadership position as he can no longer effectively represent Polkadot’s values.\n``2.`` **Permanent Ban from Future Leadership Roles:** Due to the serious nature of his actions, Don Diego should be disqualified from holding any future leadership positions within Polkadot. His malicious intent and disregard for transparency disqualify him from acting as a representative of the ecosystem.\n``3.`` **Public Apology and Reconciliation Efforts:** To mitigate any reputational damage caused, Don Diego should be required to issue a formal apology to the community and the financial institutions he implicated. This step would serve as an acknowledgment of his wrongdoing and an effort to rebuild trust with the community.\n\nAs ambassadors, we are held to the highest standards of integrity, transparency, and professionalism. Don Diego’s actions have violated these standards, and swift action is necessary to protect Polkadot’s reputation and ensure that our leadership reflects the values of the ecosystem.\n\n* if anyone asks for proof can speak with Onyze directly and I will bridge the connection.\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Reduce the Set of Head Ambassadors and Start an Effective Ambassador Program",
      "content": "tl;dr - This proposal aims to make the Ambassador Program effective. We propose to lower the number of Head Ambassadors to 10 and move some of them to Senior roles (if they accept this solution). The proposing 10 Head Ambassadors have agreed on a 100-day plan to kickstart the program.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Polkadot Ambassador Collective is a Web3 first. It is the first time an ecosystem has an on-chain body of elected representatives of the network. The ambassador program has to reflect the values, vision, and ambition of the Polkadot DAO. It is vital that the program becomes a success and an example to be followed.\n\nAfter observing the very slow start of the Ambassador Program for several weeks and after some serious consideration, we have come to the difficult conclusion that the group of Head Ambassadors needs to be downsized to get the program finally started. In addition, we propose a 100-day plan to be executed immediately to start the recruitment of Ambassadors, event organization, BD efforts, and more.\n\nWe think this cut is necessary because of three reasons:\n\n1.  A group of 21 Head Ambassadors is too big to bootstrap the program. Too many cooks in the kitchen significantly slow down the bootstrapping phase. So far, no real initiative has seen the light of the day.\n2.  The primary responsibility of Head Ambassadors is to be leaders. Not everyone in the group has grown to the challenge. Some primarily focus on certain areas only, such as BD. This qualifies one as Senior Ambassador, but not Head Ambassador.\n3.  The cost structure of the Ambassador program should be lean. Voters need to trust that the Ambassador program can achieve results at a cost-efficient rate. As long as the program is not fully operational, costs should be minimized.\n\n## Removal of Head Ambassadors\n\nWe understand that it will not be easy for affected former Head Ambassadors to accept this change. We want to make it clear that we value what all of you bring to the table. Each of you has qualities that we want to see in the Ambassador program. We have agreed to fast-track applications for Senior Ambassadors for you to give the ones who want to stay in the program and contribute a chance.\n\nGiven those considerations, we propose to remove the following Head Ambassadors from the group and **accept some of them to Senior Ambassador roles later** (if they choose to apply).\n\n-   EzioRed\n-   Georgi\n-   CrisNguyen\n-   Mario Schraepen\n-   Mexican Collective\n-   Max\\_HIC\n-   Albert - I Love Cripto\n-   Mario\n-   Irina Karagyaur\n-   William\n\nThis is not an easy step and we understand that it will create a lot of discussion. We see this change as necessary to get the program off the ground. We want to create a program that works effectively and it is just not possible with 21 Head Ambassadors. Working effectively and making quick decisions is necessary in this first phase.

      "title": "Fellowship: Retain bkchr at rank 6",
      "content": "Hey, I'm Bastian Köcher (bkchr) a rank 6 Fellowship member. The Fellowship requires that members up to rank 6 apply for retention to stay at their rank. Otherwise they can get down ranked. Normally these referendums are done within the Fellowship itself. To retain rank X, members of rank X + 2 need to vote in favor of you. In my case, there doesn't exist any member of rank 8+ that could vote for me. So, I need to use the Fellowship track to get approval from all the token holders.\n\nAt rank 6 I need to request retention every 6 months. This retention is for the time frame from March 2024 until September 2024. \n\nMy main contribution during this time was around the **Merkleized Metadata** feature, better known as \"generic support for offline signers\", as described in [RFC78](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/RFCs/approved/0078-merkleized-metadata.html). I helped write the RFC, was responsible for its implementation in the Polkadot SDK, and also I contributed to rolling this essential feature out in the ecosystem. With this new feature, offline signers like Ledger are now able to support any FRAME-based parachain. \nBefore this essential feature was implemented, the developers of the Ledger application had to hardcode the calls of each parachain/relay chain runtime; and each Ledger application update required a separate audit. This process was quite slow and didn't really fit in with the model of forkless runtime upgrade provided by Polkadot SDK.\n\nThe upgrade that enabled the generic offline signers support wasn't as smooth as I had wished. I knew beforehand that it would break the transaction format, requiring wallets and platform builders to be prepared for this breaking change. \nI helped to initiate a new process for ecosystem-wide notifications to get this critical information out and make sure that it reaches all ecosystem teams. But some builders still fell through the cracks and experienced difficulties with adapting to the new feature. \nTo ensure that this never happens again, I proposed [RFC 99](https://polkadot-fellows.github.io/RFCs/approved/0099-transaction-extension-version.html) to introduce a new version in the transaction format. Thanks to this version, the runtime is now able to decode transactions made in the old format, and thus continue to support non-upgraded wallets.\n\nMy other important area of contribution was in supporting core developers, ecosystem builders, and blockchain engineers. \nFor the launch of Coretime on Kusama, my work has mainly been about providing insights on the internals of Coretime to improve developers and users understanding, reviewing pull requests, and fixing small issues as they came up. The runtime upgrade on Kusama that should migrate the parachains from leases to Coretime did not work as expected. Some of the XCM messages for setting up the state on the Coretime chain failed. So, I debugged these XCM issues to ensure that ecosystem builders have a smooth transition to Coretime without any major issues.\n\nI'm often involved in discussions with builders/users in various public channels like Element, [Polkadot Forum](https://forum.polkadot.network/u/bkchr/summary), or [Stackexchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/users/73/bkchr) to help solve their issues.\n\nBesides the work highlighted above, I'm also very active in maintaining the [Fellowship runtimes repo](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/issues/created_by/bkchr) by providing reviews, helping with releases, and proposing changes of my own. \nI'm also very active when it comes to on-chain voting in the Fellowship, such as opening retention and promotion proposals for many members. I have taken part in an in-person interview to promote one\nmember to Architect (rank 4) and I have submitted Whitelisting referendums to fast track network upgrades and RFC related referendums. \nSince March, I have spent a lot of time reflecting on how to improve the Fellowship collective and coordination between members. I set up the [Fellowship Secretary](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/help-center/issues/8) as a new role to help with internal Fellowship processes and also to work as a bridge with ecosystem teams.\n\nFor the past 6 years, I have dedicated myself to Polkadot to help the network become successful from the technical side of things and grow even more. I hope that my work and contributions listed above will convince you to vote in favor of my retention as a Grand Architect of the Polkadot Technical Fellowship.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "As explained in the [comment in #994](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/994#RZBo0wGy9sYccnh0kRq7), I would like to remove myself from the Fellowship collective.\n\nNote that a referendum in Fellowship Admin track is necessary for this, as fellowship collective itself is [limited](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/main/system-parachains/collectives/collectives-polkadot/src/fellowship/mod.rs#L128) in its power of demotion and removal.\n\nI have explained my reasons a bit in the comments in #994. In short, I think this is the best option for me and for the community. For my Polkadot community engagement, I do value greatly on my freedom in choosing what I would prefer to work on and during which time. As someone who occasionally suffers from burn-outs, this is especially important for me in maintaining my productivity and creativity. The plain-old treasury proposal process will be a lot more suitable for me, as I can set my own timelines (rather than Fellowship fixed 6 months). I think this will also be better for the community, as you will have more direct chances to review and audit my work.\n\nI therefore hope that the community can respect my request and vote Aye to remove myself from the Fellowship collective.\n\nI'll of course continue to engage in the Polkadot community and I look forward to you, all community members, reviewing my treasury proposals in the future.",

Additionally, it was suggested while at a WebZero meet-up that an additional way I can support onboarding to Polkadot would be to work and judge Hackathons by working with Developers prior, to better define their product, and after the Hackathon to help them further develop on Polkadot and become part of our eco. As a dedicated HA I would support all initiatives that strengthen the ECO from QA to go to Market. \n\nTo me the Head Ambassadors are not just faces, but speakers, strategists, facilitators of sales initiatives, internal processes and servicing the community. We lead, support and bring forth positive changes based on the best interests of Polkadot, Jam and its community. \n\n•\tHere is a bit of the contribution I have made to Polkadot thus far; https://forum.polkadot.network/t/decoded-2024-sponsorship-for-active-community-members/7654/30?u=hopeclary \n•\tI understand I will be an ambassador to Polkadot’s best interests. I currently see this, but not limited to: Gaming, AI, Governess, CoreTime, Bridging Partnerships, facilitating trust within WEB3 and sharing benefits in normal relatable services of current WEB2 to facilitate transitions into WEB3.  \n•\tI am technical, experienced with legal negotiations & contracts in addition to translating to normie speak. Past work roles for a Network Switching Company: Corporate Technical Trainer, QA, Product Delivery, Product Manager, Product Strategy, Product Analyst. \no\tI will represent Polkadot HA on LinkedIn www.linkedin.com/in/hope-goodman-49217730 Having worked for a fortune 100 US company for over 20+ years. I was Product Delivery for Apple Pay in the US for this Network Switching Services company, they’re the WEB2 layer 0 equivalent of Polkadot for financial transactions. Meaning, we routed transactions from point-of-sale devices through Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and banking network funnels for approval and denial of a consumers purchases. When meeting people, if asked what I do for a living, I would share my past job experience & lead into my current role as a Polkadot HA. I will be describing what Polkadot is to businesses and the functions we provide through WEB3…. Connecting Polkadot to real world adoption, awareness & usage.\no\tI can do presentations, write/collaborate on working legal agreements, and go after leads that would benefit Polkadot. I am actively going for additional collaboration initiatives for Polkadot that would help put us in the spotlight.\n•\tI would like to mirror a BD team like Brazil in the US, or work with this high performing team on US initiatives, as they’re part of the America’s. I understand big deals are never done alone! In addition, it has been my experience that specific skills are needed for these teams to be successful. \n•\t My goal as HA, for our HA team is to facilitate & support these initiatives. When working with global companies having representatives in multiple areas of the globe 🌐 will be beneficial. \no\tSuccess for global adoption of CoreTime and other products on-chain, we can introduce to businesses big and small, create strategies to execute upon! Example: reach out to local municipalities to see how various charity DAO’s within Polkadot may be of service in local communities. \no\tBeyond just charities, I see ways as a HA Team we can work to get positive media attention and connect with specific groups in our areas to help drive Polkadot forward for a WEB3 revolution! \n•\tI would represent Polkadot to my Politicians, locals & in Washington DC. Living in the Miami Florida Metro area. We’re Bitcoin adaptive here (Bitcoin Bull in Financial District), I will work to drive more Polkadot adoption. Very large enterprises are moving to this area including Asset Management companies and other Fortune 500 companies in addition to TV & Movie Studio’s. As a HA Team we would collaborate on appropriate BD initiatives. \no\tI would welcome working closely and collaborating with legal counsel to facilitate deals & lobbying where appropriate.\n•\t At times I will connect proposals or ideas to products within the ecosystem. I will make product recommendations & work with other talented people to make them a reality. New Product Ideas, Testing, Feedback, making introductions & pitches. Whatever is in the best interest of Polkadot and Jam!\n•\tWith access to footage, I would make appropriate presentations and commercials.\n•\t Attending and creating events locally in addition to Crypto Conferences and Conferences of industries we’re looking to break into, or expand in. \n•\t Create In person and online engagements to connect with other Crypto communities to facilitate collaboration & trust.\n•\t Continued Participation in video meetings for Polkadot and Jam initiatives, Polkadot Forum, Telegram & helping people navigate all things Polkadot and Jam.\n•\t Continued work on Bounties or where needed for DAO funding support. \n•\t As HA I would always be open to connecting and creating collaborations with other Crypto Ecosystems, Participants and Products because Polkadot is the WEB3 Layer 0!\n",

Our proposal highlights our track record in building business relationships and public outreach. Our planned activities include business development, event participation, outreach, and community support. With extensive experience in the Polkadot ecosystem, significant followings, and notable contributions to key projects, we aim to leverage our skills and networks to advance Polkadot's values and presence.\n\n# Full Proposal #\n\nThis application proposes Dustin Lee and Josiah Kotzur for a dual Head Ambassador position. This decision comes after much discussion about our company's internal workload, Metarock Ltd trading as DeStore.

Our profiles demonstrate our long-standing advocacy for the Polkadot ecosystem on social media and at real-life events. Given our geographical locations, this proposal seeks for us to cover the areas we live in.

I’m applying for the HA, covering the region of Australasia. Australasia covers Australia, New Zealand, and neighboring island nations in the South Pacific Ocean. I co-organize Blockchain Byron monthly meetups with 400+ local and active members. I have strong relationships with Australia's most trusted exchange, Swyftx, Binance, Independent Reserve, and Animoca Brands. I supported the negotiations to get $ASTR listed in Australia on Swyftx. As a direct result, Australians can now buy $ASTR and be exposed to Astar Network educational courses. In 2024, I was a finalist for the Australia Blockies Awards for “Start-up Scale-up of the Year.”\n\n**Journey in the Polkadot Ecosystem:**  \nI founded Metarock, the parent company of DeStore, with a vision to sell opals from my opal mine in the metaverse caught Discovery Channel's attention and was filmed in the series Outback Opal Hunters. DeStore beta was built on Kusama using a fork of RMRK 1.0 in 2022/23. In Q3 2023, DeStore was part of the Sony Astar incubator, which took my team and me to Japan, where we plan to connect brands that sell RWAs to Web 3.0, maintaining an active relationship with eLogIT, Japan's largest fulfillment company.\n\n## Supporting Articles and Videos:\n- **[ABC Article](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/101428632)**\n- **[Discovery Channel Metaverse sale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HufA9OM9HQw)**\n- **[Gavin Wood GBM auction Proof of Ownership](https://x.com/GBMauction/status/1790705967119859737)**\n- **[Darwinia Developer Grant](https://medium.com/darwinianetwork/grants-program-metarock-receives-darwinia-grant-bringing-nft-trading-and-minting-market-on-crab-eff08089c22a)**\n- **[Sony Incubator Demo Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AT27hlARc-Y)**\n- **[Polkadot Relayer Incubator Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqiEyuORLXI)**\n- **[Australia Blockies Award Finalist](https://x.com/DECAustralia/status/1713736518873878733)**\n\n\n**Motivations & Vision:**  \nDriven by my passion for Polkadot, I aim to channel my inspiration, connections, and social outreach to promote its values of decentralization and self-sovereignty.

      "content": "Head Ambassador Candidate: Luca Poggi  \nTwitter: https://x.com/LucaPoggi7  \nTelegram: https://t.me/LucaPoggi  \nDiscord: lucapoggi\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/Qmrq5Fc/12522-Iceberg-Nodes-1721053430476.jpg)\n\nDear Polkadot community,\n\nMy name is Luca Poggi and I am excited to present my candidacy for the role of Head Ambassador in the Polkadot Ambassadors Program.\n\nHA role demands dedication and a passion for promoting Polkadot, and together with my team, we are feeling ready to leverage our skills to enhance and strengthen Polkadot's presence in the blockchain world.\n\nThe team I have selected is composed of individuals who share my principles. They will be actively supporting and executing a range of activities (see list below). As Head Ambassador, my role will not only be active in performing proposed activities, but also in representing and managing the activities, as well as being responsible for the entire group’s performance.\n\n## Proposed Activities\n\n### Business Development:\n\n- Promoting partnerships with companies (B2B), universities, institutions and governative entities (B2G) to incorporate Polkadot into their activities, expanding use cases, showcase the ability to implement essential services in a sustainable and secure way, while increasing the adoption of Polkadot and its entire ecosystem.\n- Providing technical assistance and advice to subjects interested in adopting Polkadot technology and/or deploying their project in the ecosystem.\n- Participation in sector events and trade fairs to stay up to date with market needs and be able to offer a product that best suits demand, as well as getting to know new companies, subjects and possible users.\n- Provide feedback on the services and products provided by Polkadot, based on the experience of use by companies and users, directly to the technical fellowship and to the entire community of Polkadot developers.\n\n### Events and Initiatives\n\n- Participate as official representatives of Polkadot in blockchain-related events on Italian territory.\n- Planning and organizing hackathons and workshops throughout Italy to promote Polkadot to the community developers and supporting the creation and management of study groups and hands-on workshops for advanced technical training.\n- Managing media relations to ensure positive and consistent coverage of Polkadot.\n- Creating promotional and informational content for various communication channels.\n\n### Education and Evangelism:\n\n- Creating and managing technical content (posts, threads and tutorials) on social media (Twitter, Telegram and Medium) in order to explain complex concepts in a simple and accessible way.\n- Organize periodic live video calls and AMAs to discuss and keep the Polkadot community updated on the latest news.\n- Carry out classroom lessons at universities, schools and company courses about Polkadot technology.\n\n### Community Building:\n\n- Management of the Polkadot Italian community on Telegram, creating a welcoming and informative environment for members.\n- Managing dedicated social channels (on X and YouTube) to facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas.\n- Organizing local and national meetups to promote networking among Polkadot enthusiasts.\n- Engaging influencers and key figures in the blockchain world to amplify Polkadot's visibility.\n\n…and obviously…\n\n### Ambassador typical activities:\n\n- Participate in Polkadot events around the world\n- Attend HA meetings and participate in discussions in public groups\n- Provide help and collaborate in shaping the new ambassadors program\n- Collaborate with other HAs on projects where cooperation can lead to a more effective, competitive, and streamlined process\n\n## Compensation Breakdown\n\nThe HA, together with the team members, ensures a minimum monthly engagement in the proposed activities equivalent to full-time capacity, in accordance with [referenda 487](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/487). This is the minimum guaranteed condition, to be considered as the sum of the hours of activities carried out during the month by the team members. In reality, I expect that the hours dedicated to such activities, by proposing ourselves as a team, will generally exceed the minimum threshold by a consistent amount.\n\nThe monthly amount received by the HA:\n\n- A small part (if needed), about 0-20%, will be allocated to an internal treasury, managed by the HA, which will cover possible reimbursements for HA travel expenses, costs related to work tools, and other minor expenses;\n- 80-100% will be allocated to pay for the hours worked on the proposed activities, by HA and team members.\n\nFor any other expenses not falling into the categories mentioned above, a reimbursement request will be made to the ambassadors program treasury or specific on-chain bounties. In both cases, no administration or own fees will ever be counted; the expenses we will allocate in requests to the ambassador's treasury or bounties will only be out-of-pocket expenses such as the cost of sponsorship at an event.\n\nA non-profit association will be established to manage all expenses in compliance with Italian regulations.\n\n## Activities Track Records\n\nIn accordance with the motto “Don’t trust, verify” widely used in the Web3 world, we will provide a tool, in particular a public page of our internal Notion database (unfortunately, we do not have an equally practical Web3 tool), where all activities carried out will be detailed along with the hours dedicated to each of them. This page will be periodically updated and can be publicly viewed by anyone. This will also simplify the reporting process as a requirement of the ambassador's program.\n\n## My background in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nSome of you may already know me, while for others this might be the first time. In other cases, the reputation of Iceberg Nodes probably precedes me. Here is my story.\n\nI've been in the crypto space since summer 2014 and active in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem since 2019. I’m an early investor in DOT, and this gave me the opportunity to focus my energies and dedicate a lot of time in studying the technology, understanding the principles and seeing all the improvements since before the launch of Kusama (yeah there were already some Substrate projects around), until nowadays. Starting from mid 2022, I left my previous job in the welding manufacturing and certification field (I hold a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, a master’s degree in mechatronics engineering and a post master’s degree as International Welding Engineer), to become a full time crypto boy.\n\nI’m the founder of Iceberg Nodes which provides secure non-custodial staking services in a total of more than 40 different networks, 95% of them as validators on relaychains, validators on standalone Substrate based chains and collators on parachains (also in 5 system parachains), so highly focused in the Polkadot ecosystem. My involvement in the ecosystem has also increased in having “skin in the game” as seed and private investor in some of the new Polkadot ecosystem projects, having invested in such sales almost $1.5M during the last one year period.\n\n## …but wait…let me explain about my Polkadot Vision!\n\nBut before continuing with the story of my journey within Polkadot, I would like to take a moment to share my thoughts on Polkadot. I believe that, for a Head Ambassador, it is crucial to fully understand the true technology of Polkadot, its role, and, most importantly, to be able to effectively communicate this to the audience.\n\nWhat do I think about Polkadot? I am a strong supporter of modular scalability, and consequently, scalability based on sharding. I firmly believe that the scalability offered by Polkadot is the only one capable of achieving true scalability in the blockchain world.\n\nTo fully understand Polkadot, one must first understand what a parachain (or if you want “appchain”) is at the end. A parachain is a chain with specific functionalities, specialized in a particular use case. This is where the magic of Polkadot lies. Developing on Polkadot means inheriting the main network's security and accessing an entire ecosystem, including liquidity and functionalities provided by other parachains via pallets or smart contracts. When developing a product on Polkadot, whether a dApp or an entire parachain, it is crucial to form partnerships and collaborations with other parachains to leverage their functionalities for a complete final product. Within the Polkadot ecosystem, there must be a balance between cooperation and competition among parachains. Cooperation enhances Polkadot's overall product value through the use of XCM and the composability of different parachains. Healthy competition among similar projects stimulates continuous improvement and attracts new teams to the ecosystem, fostering innovation.\n\nTo elevate the product offered by Polkadot, it is necessary to educate developers not only from a technical standpoint (Rust & Polkadot SDK) but also culturally, conveying the vision and the way of developing on Polkadot, highlighting the advantages and challenges of this method. Often, I notice that developers, probably because they are used to Ethereum, design dApps with a too narrow mindset, as if they only had the possibility to create dApps based on smart contracts operating on layer 2 that rarely communicate with each other (during execution). On Polkadot, however, the product being developed has the ability to interface with other products within the ecosystem, opening the door to a new (and certainly more complex) way of developing a Web3 product. I believe that on Polkadot we should focus on developing products that cannot be developed in other ecosystems, thus strongly based on the unique functionalities that Polkadot offers. In my opinion, those who develop on Polkadot with a focus on these concepts, as well as managing to create an abstraction that allows various users to interact with the project itself without necessarily knowing the technical details, or even knowing which network they are interacting with or what operations are being performed \"under the hood,\" will be projects that, in my view, have excellent chances of success.\n\nIn addition to what has been mentioned, I am a supporter of fee-less chains and account abstraction, which I believe are crucial for the future adoption of blockchain technology. It is important to note that \"fee-less\" does not mean the chain is easily susceptible to spam; rather, it means the feeless system is managed in a specific way, based on the product offered and certain conditions.\n\nIn addition, I believe it is necessary to avoid creating new tokens unless they are strictly necessary for the project. Currently, there are too many tokens in circulation; a quick look at CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko reveals this. In most cases, tokens are created merely to finance projects or, worse, for fraudulent purposes. Aside from PoW systems, the primary role of a token in PoS systems is to secure the network. Polkadot’s shared security technology makes it unnecessary to have a separate token for securing its parachains (aka staking). If a native token is necessary, the DOT token could serve this purpose, providing additional benefits to DOT holders. For instance, the selection of collators could be managed through other methods, such as the PoL (Proof of Liquidity) model, which I find particularly interesting. Moreover, with a well-funded treasury willing to support valid projects, development can proceed without issuing new tokens. The team’s profits should come from the volume and revenue generated by the product itself rather than from token sales. This economic model, based on revenue proportional to the product’s success, is most suitable for treasury funding. The project team's profits would align with achieving specific usage volumes, matching the interests of the Polkadot community and treasury in supporting such products. Private investors can still play a role by providing liquidity or other services, being rewarded based on the project's success. It is also worth mentioning a new funding mechanism soon to be available on Polkadot, devised by [lolmcshizz](https://x.com/lolmcshizz/status/1808832287758237861), called \"Optimistic Project Funding\". This mechanism allows users to nominate whitelisted projects with their DOT. It will be funded with a constant stream of DOT taken directly from inflation and distributed to projects based on the proportion of DOT that has nominated them.\n\nObviously, these guidelines should not be seen as mandatory for all projects developing on Polkadot but rather as a guide for those projects that choose to fund most of their development through the treasury. Of course, there will always be the option to issue own token by accessing private funding methods, as has been the case in 99% of instances to date.\n\nI am collaborating with a group of developers to create a project based on these principles using Polkadot SDK. Although I cannot provide specific details, I can say that it involves an existing Web2 application where blockchain can significantly enhance and improve an already widely-used type of products. This is a crucial point: many projects approach blockchain because it attracts attention, money, and investors, but often blockchain becomes an obstacle during product development, especially if the same product can function effectively without blockchain (even without compromises), or if adopted without considering the necessary requirements for it to function appropriately (decentralization, security, etc.).\n\nI firmly believe in the principles outlined above, and I bring them with me when speaking at conferences, both on stage and at booths, with developers interested in creating their projects on Polkadot.\n\n## My contributions in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nThat said, let's return to my biography, specifically my involvement in the Polkadot community. Currently, I serve as a curator in three bounties: Marketing Bounty (technical curator), BD Bounty (technical curator), and Meetups Bounty. In the past, with Iceberg Nodes, I was a member (now former member) of the Dot Validator Alliance and Polkadot.Pro. Currently, I am a member of United Block (an alliance of validators and collators in the Polkadot ecosystem providing RPC services to various projects) and a member of Polkadot's 1KV program. Additionally, I am a friend of ChaosDAO members, participate in their public conversations, and Iceberg Nodes is on their trusted validators list.\n\nMy commitment to the Italian Polkadot community began in 2019 when the need arose to establish the Italian Polkadot group. Since then, I have been a co-founder of Polkadot Italia, which now has around 2000 members. I have also founded or become an admin in other Italian groups specific to various parachains.

This title will have significant value when interacting with companies, universities, government entities, and public administrations, giving us a different level of authority compared to presenting ourselves as simple community members. Additionally, the funds allocated for the HA salary will be used to support these activities, covering the necessary work hours by team members. This will allow us to plan and carry out activities in a structured and organized manner.\n\nI am pleased to have submitted this candidacy, regardless of the outcome, because behind me there is a team of people who, like me, strongly believe in Polkadot's success. My candidacy also represents a way to recognize their contributions within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nI apologize if I have taken the time to describe my vision and way of thinking within this candidacy text, but I believe it is an important element in evaluating a candidacy for the role of HA.\n\nRegardless of the on-chain outcome of the proposal, I am pleased to have had the opportunity to share our reality. If you appreciate what you have read and believe that my candidacy has merit, I invite you to vote in favor. Conversely, feel free to vote against if you do not agree.\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to post them. I will make it a priority to respond as soon as possible. You can also contact me via DM if you prefer.\n\nEnjoy your time within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nThank you all for taking the time to read this proposal!\n\nNOTE: 13VMfHtAP8LgsK6CHSP6b6f31zuK837CBrFFdDa582HWXESJ ([@LucaPoggi](/user/LucaPoggi)) is the address object of the call of this referenda, as soon as the identities migration from Polkadot Relaychain to Polkadot People Sys Parachain is finished, sub-identity as \"Luca Poggi\" under super-identity \"Iceberg Nodes\" (14icei1ZMoG9QtKBFDk4y1eMR756q2TREuRAi2BanJ9MJVPL) will be set.",

They will be actively supporting and executing a range of activities (see list below). As Head Ambassador, my role will not only be active in performing proposed activities, but also in representing and managing the activities, as well as being responsible for the entire group’s performance.\n\n## Proposed Activities\n\n### Business Development:\n\n- Promoting partnerships with companies (B2B), universities, institutions and governative entities (B2G) to incorporate Polkadot into their activities, expanding use cases, showcase the ability to implement essential services in a sustainable and secure way, while increasing the adoption of Polkadot and its entire ecosystem.\n- Providing technical assistance and advice to subjects interested in adopting Polkadot technology and/or deploying their project in the ecosystem.\n- Participation in sector events and trade fairs to stay up to date with market needs and be able to offer a product that best suits demand, as well as getting to know new companies, subjects and possible users.\n- Provide feedback on the services and products provided by Polkadot, based on the experience of use by companies and users, directly to the technical fellowship and to the entire community of Polkadot developers.\n\n### Events and Initiatives\n\n- Participate as official representatives of Polkadot in blockchain-related events on Italian territory.\n- Planning and organizing hackathons and workshops throughout Italy to promote Polkadot to the community developers and supporting the creation and management of study groups and hands-on workshops for advanced technical training.\n- Managing media relations to ensure positive and consistent coverage of Polkadot.\n- Creating promotional and informational content for various communication channels.\n\n### Education and Evangelism:\n\n- Creating and managing technical content (posts, threads and tutorials) on social media (Twitter, Telegram and Medium) in order to explain complex concepts in a simple and accessible way.\n- Organize periodic live video calls and AMAs to discuss and keep the Polkadot community updated on the latest news.\n- Carry out classroom lessons at universities, schools and company courses about Polkadot technology.\n\n### Community Building:\n\n- Management of the Polkadot Italian community on Telegram, creating a welcoming and informative environment for members.\n- Managing dedicated social channels (on X and YouTube) to facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas.\n- Organizing local and national meetups to promote networking among Polkadot enthusiasts.\n- Engaging influencers and key figures in the blockchain world to amplify Polkadot's visibility.\n\n…and obviously…\n\n### Ambassador typical activities:\n\n- Participate in Polkadot events around the world\n- Attend HA meetings and participate in discussions in public groups\n- Provide help and collaborate in shaping the new ambassadors program\n- Collaborate with other HAs on projects where cooperation can lead to a more effective, competitive, and streamlined process\n\n## Compensation Breakdown\n\nThe HA, together with the team members, ensures a minimum monthly engagement in the proposed activities equivalent to full-time capacity, in accordance with [referenda 487](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/487). This is the minimum guaranteed condition, to be considered as the sum of the hours of activities carried out during the month by the team members. In reality, I expect that the hours dedicated to such activities, by proposing ourselves as a team, will generally exceed the minimum threshold by a consistent amount.\n\nThe monthly amount received by the HA:\n\n- A small part (if needed), about 0-20%, will be allocated to an internal treasury, managed by the HA, which will cover possible reimbursements for HA travel expenses, costs related to work tools, and other minor expenses;\n- 80-100% will be allocated to pay for the hours worked on the proposed activities, by HA and team members.\n\nFor any other expenses not falling into the categories mentioned above, a reimbursement request will be made to the ambassadors program treasury or specific on-chain bounties. In both cases, no administration or own fees will ever be counted; the expenses we will allocate in requests to the ambassador's treasury or bounties will only be out-of-pocket expenses such as the cost of sponsorship at an event.\n\nA non-profit association will be established to manage all expenses in compliance with Italian regulations.\n\n## Activities Track Records\n\nIn accordance with the motto “Don’t trust, verify” widely used in the Web3 world, we will provide a tool, in particular a public page of our internal Notion database (unfortunately, we do not have an equally practical Web3 tool), where all activities carried out will be detailed along with the hours dedicated to each of them. This page will be periodically updated and can be publicly viewed by anyone. This will also simplify the reporting process as a requirement of the ambassador's program.\n\n## My background in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nSome of you may already know me, while for others this might be the first time. In other cases, the reputation of Iceberg Nodes probably precedes me. Here is my story.\n\nI've been in the crypto space since summer 2014 and active in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem since 2019. I’m an early investor in DOT, and this gave me the opportunity to focus my energies and dedicate a lot of time in studying the technology, understanding the principles and seeing all the improvements since before the launch of Kusama (yeah there were already some Substrate projects around), until nowadays. Starting from mid 2022, I left my previous job in the welding manufacturing and certification field (I hold a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, a master’s degree in mechatronics engineering and a post master’s degree as International Welding Engineer), to become a full time crypto boy.\n\nI’m the founder of Iceberg Nodes which provides secure non-custodial staking services in a total of more than 40 different networks, 95% of them as validators on relaychains, validators on standalone Substrate based chains and collators on parachains (also in 5 system parachains), so highly focused in the Polkadot ecosystem. My involvement in the ecosystem has also increased in having “skin in the game” as seed and private investor in some of the new Polkadot ecosystem projects, having invested in such sales almost $1.5M during the last one year period.\n\n## …but wait…let me explain about my Polkadot Vision!\n\nBut before continuing with the story of my journey within Polkadot, I would like to take a moment to share my thoughts on Polkadot. I believe that, for a Head Ambassador, it is crucial to fully understand the true technology of Polkadot, its role, and, most importantly, to be able to effectively communicate this to the audience.\n\nWhat do I think about Polkadot? I am a strong supporter of modular scalability, and consequently, scalability based on sharding. I firmly believe that the scalability offered by Polkadot is the only one capable of achieving true scalability in the blockchain world.\n\nTo fully understand Polkadot, one must first understand what a parachain (or if you want “appchain”) is at the end. A parachain is a chain with specific functionalities, specialized in a particular use case. This is where the magic of Polkadot lies. Developing on Polkadot means inheriting the main network's security and accessing an entire ecosystem, including liquidity and functionalities provided by other parachains via pallets or smart contracts. When developing a product on Polkadot, whether a dApp or an entire parachain, it is crucial to form partnerships and collaborations with other parachains to leverage their functionalities for a complete final product. Within the Polkadot ecosystem, there must be a balance between cooperation and competition among parachains. Cooperation enhances Polkadot's overall product value through the use of XCM and the composability of different parachains. Healthy competition among similar projects stimulates continuous improvement and attracts new teams to the ecosystem, fostering innovation.\n\nTo elevate the product offered by Polkadot, it is necessary to educate developers not only from a technical standpoint (Rust & Polkadot SDK) but also culturally, conveying the vision and the way of developing on Polkadot, highlighting the advantages and challenges of this method. Often, I notice that developers, probably because they are used to Ethereum, design dApps with a too narrow mindset, as if they only had the possibility to create dApps based on smart contracts operating on layer 2 that rarely communicate with each other (during execution). On Polkadot, however, the product being developed has the ability to interface with other products within the ecosystem, opening the door to a new (and certainly more complex) way of developing a Web3 product. I believe that on Polkadot we should focus on developing products that cannot be developed in other ecosystems, thus strongly based on the unique functionalities that Polkadot offers. In my opinion, those who develop on Polkadot with a focus on these concepts, as well as managing to create an abstraction that allows various users to interact with the project itself without necessarily knowing the technical details, or even knowing which network they are interacting with or what operations are being performed \"under the hood,\" will be projects that, in my view, have excellent chances of success.\n\nIn addition to what has been mentioned, I am a supporter of fee-less chains and account abstraction, which I believe are crucial for the future adoption of blockchain technology. It is important to note that \"fee-less\" does not mean the chain is easily susceptible to spam; rather, it means the feeless system is managed in a specific way, based on the product offered and certain conditions.\n\nIn addition, I believe it is necessary to avoid creating new tokens unless they are strictly necessary for the project. Currently, there are too many tokens in circulation; a quick look at CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko reveals this. In most cases, tokens are created merely to finance projects or, worse, for fraudulent purposes. Aside from PoW systems, the primary role of a token in PoS systems is to secure the network. Polkadot’s shared security technology makes it unnecessary to have a separate token for securing its parachains (aka staking). If a native token is necessary, the DOT token could serve this purpose, providing additional benefits to DOT holders. For instance, the selection of collators could be managed through other methods, such as the PoL (Proof of Liquidity) model, which I find particularly interesting. Moreover, with a well-funded treasury willing to support valid projects, development can proceed without issuing new tokens. The team’s profits should come from the volume and revenue generated by the product itself rather than from token sales. This economic model, based on revenue proportional to the product’s success, is most suitable for treasury funding. The project team's profits would align with achieving specific usage volumes, matching the interests of the Polkadot community and treasury in supporting such products. Private investors can still play a role by providing liquidity or other services, being rewarded based on the project's success. It is also worth mentioning a new funding mechanism soon to be available on Polkadot, devised by [lolmcshizz](https://x.com/lolmcshizz/status/1808832287758237861), called \"Optimistic Project Funding\". This mechanism allows users to nominate whitelisted projects with their DOT. It will be funded with a constant stream of DOT taken directly from inflation and distributed to projects based on the proportion of DOT that has nominated them.\n\nObviously, these guidelines should not be seen as mandatory for all projects developing on Polkadot but rather as a guide for those projects that choose to fund most of their development through the treasury. Of course, there will always be the option to issue own token by accessing private funding methods, as has been the case in 99% of instances to date.\n\nI am collaborating with a group of developers to create a project based on these principles using Polkadot SDK. Although I cannot provide specific details, I can say that it involves an existing Web2 application where blockchain can significantly enhance and improve an already widely-used type of products. This is a crucial point: many projects approach blockchain because it attracts attention, money, and investors, but often blockchain becomes an obstacle during product development, especially if the same product can function effectively without blockchain (even without compromises), or if adopted without considering the necessary requirements for it to function appropriately (decentralization, security, etc.).\n\nI firmly believe in the principles outlined above, and I bring them with me when speaking at conferences, both on stage and at booths, with developers interested in creating their projects on Polkadot.\n\n## My contributions in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nThat said, let's return to my biography, specifically my involvement in the Polkadot community. Currently, I serve as a curator in three bounties: Marketing Bounty (technical curator), BD Bounty (technical curator), and Meetups Bounty. In the past, with Iceberg Nodes, I was a member (now former member) of the Dot Validator Alliance and Polkadot.Pro. Currently, I am a member of United Block (an alliance of validators and collators in the Polkadot ecosystem providing RPC services to various projects) and a member of Polkadot's 1KV program. Additionally, I am a friend of ChaosDAO members, participate in their public conversations, and Iceberg Nodes is on their trusted validators list.\n\nMy commitment to the Italian Polkadot community began in 2019 when the need arose to establish the Italian Polkadot group. Since then, I have been a co-founder of Polkadot Italia, which now has around 2000 members. I have also founded or become an admin in other Italian groups specific to various parachains.

They will be actively supporting and executing a range of activities (see list below). As Head Ambassador, my role will not only be active in performing proposed activities, but also in representing and managing the activities, as well as being responsible for the entire group’s performance.\n\n## Proposed Activities\n\n### Business Development:\n\n- Promoting partnerships with companies (B2B), universities, institutions and governative entities (B2G) to incorporate Polkadot into their activities, expanding use cases, showcase the ability to implement essential services in a sustainable and secure way, while increasing the adoption of Polkadot and its entire ecosystem.\n\n- Providing technical assistance and advice to subjects interested in adopting Polkadot technology and/or deploying their project in the ecosystem.\n\n- Participation in sector events and trade fairs to stay up to date with market needs and be able to offer a product that best suits demand, as well as getting to know new companies, subjects and possible users.\n\n- Provide feedback on the services and products provided by Polkadot, based on the experience of use by companies and users, directly to the technical fellowship and to the entire community of Polkadot developers.\n\n### Events and Initiatives\n\n- Participate as official representatives of Polkadot in blockchain-related events on Italian territory.\n\n- Planning and organizing hackathons and workshops throughout Italy to promote Polkadot to the community developers and supporting the creation and management of study groups and hands-on workshops for advanced technical training.\n\n- Managing media relations to ensure positive and consistent coverage of Polkadot.\n\n- Creating promotional and informational content for various communication channels.\n\n### Education and Evangelism:\n\n- Creating and managing technical content (posts, threads and tutorials) on social media (Twitter, Telegram and Medium) in order to explain complex concepts in a simple and accessible way.\n\n- Organize periodic live video calls and AMAs to discuss and keep the Polkadot community updated on the latest news.\n\n- Carry out classroom lessons at universities, schools and company courses about Polkadot technology.\n\n### Community Building:\n\n- Management of the Polkadot Italian community on Telegram, creating a welcoming and informative environment for members.\n\n- Managing dedicated social channels (on X and YouTube) to facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas.\n\n- Organizing local and national meetups to promote networking among Polkadot enthusiasts.\n\n- Engaging influencers and key figures in the blockchain world to amplify Polkadot's visibility.\n\n…and obviously…\n\n### Ambassador typical activities:\n\n- Participate in Polkadot events around the world\n\n- Attend HA meetings and participate in discussions in public groups\n\n- Provide help and collaborate in shaping the new ambassadors program\n\n- Collaborate with other HAs on projects where cooperation can lead to a more effective, competitive, and streamlined process\n\n## Compensation Breakdown\n\nThe HA, together with the team members, ensures a minimum monthly engagement in the proposed activities equivalent to full-time capacity, in accordance with [referenda 487](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/487). This is the minimum guaranteed condition, to be considered as the sum of the hours of activities carried out during the month by the team members. In reality, I expect that the hours dedicated to such activities, by proposing ourselves as a team, will generally exceed the minimum threshold by a consistent amount.\n\nThe monthly amount received by the HA:\n\n- A small part (if needed), about 0-20%, will be allocated to an internal treasury, managed by the HA, which will cover possible reimbursements for HA travel expenses, costs related to work tools, and other minor expenses;\n\n- 80-100% will be allocated to pay for the hours worked on the proposed activities, by HA and team members.\n\nFor any other expenses not falling into the categories mentioned above, a reimbursement request will be made to the ambassadors program treasury or specific on-chain bounties. In both cases, no administration or own fees will ever be counted; the expenses we will allocate in requests to the ambassador's treasury or bounties will only be out-of-pocket expenses such as the cost of sponsorship at an event.\n\nA non-profit association will be established to manage all expenses in compliance with Italian regulations.\n\n## Activities Track Records\n\nIn accordance with the motto “Don’t trust, verify” widely used in the Web3 world, we will provide a tool, in particular a public page of our internal Notion database (unfortunately, we do not have an equally practical Web3 tool), where all activities carried out will be detailed along with the hours dedicated to each of them. This page will be periodically updated and can be publicly viewed by anyone. This will also simplify the reporting process as a requirement of the ambassador's program.\n\n## My background in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nSome of you may already know me, while for others this might be the first time. In other cases, the reputation of Iceberg Nodes probably precedes me. Here is my story.\n\nI've been in the crypto space since summer 2014 and active in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem since 2019. I’m an early investor in DOT, and this gave me the opportunity to focus my energies and dedicate a lot of time in studying the technology, understanding the principles and seeing all the improvements since before the launch of Kusama (yeah there were already some Substrate projects around), until nowadays. Starting from mid 2022, I left my previous job in the welding manufacturing and certification field (I hold a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, a master’s degree in mechatronics engineering and a post master’s degree as International Welding Engineer), to become a full time crypto boy.\n\nI’m the founder of Iceberg Nodes which provides secure non-custodial staking services in a total of more than 40 different networks, 95% of them as validators on relaychains, validators on standalone Substrate based chains and collators on parachains (also in 5 system parachains), so highly focused in the Polkadot ecosystem. My involvement in the ecosystem has also increased in having “skin in the game” as seed and private investor in some of the new Polkadot ecosystem projects, having invested in such sales almost $1.5M during the last one year period.\n\n## …but wait…let me explain about my Polkadot Vision!\n\nBut before continuing with the story of my journey within Polkadot, I would like to take a moment to share my thoughts on Polkadot. I believe that, for a Head Ambassador, it is crucial to fully understand the true technology of Polkadot, its role, and, most importantly, to be able to effectively communicate this to the audience.\n\nWhat do I think about Polkadot? I am a strong supporter of modular scalability, and consequently, scalability based on sharding. I firmly believe that the scalability offered by Polkadot is the only one capable of achieving true scalability in the blockchain world.\n\nTo fully understand Polkadot, one must first understand what a parachain (or if you want “appchain”) is at the end. A parachain is a chain with specific functionalities, specialized in a particular use case. This is where the magic of Polkadot lies. Developing on Polkadot means inheriting the main network's security and accessing an entire ecosystem, including liquidity and functionalities provided by other parachains via pallets or smart contracts. When developing a product on Polkadot, whether a dApp or an entire parachain, it is crucial to form partnerships and collaborations with other parachains to leverage their functionalities for a complete final product. Within the Polkadot ecosystem, there must be a balance between cooperation and competition among parachains. Cooperation enhances Polkadot's overall product value through the use of XCM and the composability of different parachains. Healthy competition among similar projects stimulates continuous improvement and attracts new teams to the ecosystem, fostering innovation.\n\nTo elevate the product offered by Polkadot, it is necessary to educate developers not only from a technical standpoint (Rust & Polkadot SDK) but also culturally, conveying the vision and the way of developing on Polkadot, highlighting the advantages and challenges of this method. Often, I notice that developers, probably because they are used to Ethereum, design dApps with a too narrow mindset, as if they only had the possibility to create dApps based on smart contracts operating on layer 2 that rarely communicate with each other (during execution). On Polkadot, however, the product being developed has the ability to interface with other products within the ecosystem, opening the door to a new (and certainly more complex) way of developing a Web3 product. I believe that on Polkadot we should focus on developing products that cannot be developed in other ecosystems, thus strongly based on the unique functionalities that Polkadot offers. In my opinion, those who develop on Polkadot with a focus on these concepts, as well as managing to create an abstraction that allows various users to interact with the project itself without necessarily knowing the technical details, or even knowing which network they are interacting with or what operations are being performed \"under the hood,\" will be projects that, in my view, have excellent chances of success.\n\nIn addition to what has been mentioned, I am a supporter of fee-less chains and account abstraction, which I believe are crucial for the future adoption of blockchain technology. It is important to note that \"fee-less\" does not mean the chain is easily susceptible to spam; rather, it means the feeless system is managed in a specific way, based on the product offered and certain conditions.\n\nIn addition, I believe it is necessary to avoid creating new tokens unless they are strictly necessary for the project. Currently, there are too many tokens in circulation; a quick look at CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko reveals this. In most cases, tokens are created merely to finance projects or, worse, for fraudulent purposes. Aside from PoW systems, the primary role of a token in PoS systems is to secure the network. Polkadot’s shared security technology makes it unnecessary to have a separate token for securing its parachains (aka staking). If a native token is necessary, the DOT token could serve this purpose, providing additional benefits to DOT holders. For instance, the selection of collators could be managed through other methods, such as the PoL (Proof of Liquidity) model, which I find particularly interesting. Moreover, with a well-funded treasury willing to support valid projects, development can proceed without issuing new tokens. The team’s profits should come from the volume and revenue generated by the product itself rather than from token sales. This economic model, based on revenue proportional to the product’s success, is most suitable for treasury funding. The project team's profits would align with achieving specific usage volumes, matching the interests of the Polkadot community and treasury in supporting such products. Private investors can still play a role by providing liquidity or other services, being rewarded based on the project's success. It is also worth mentioning a new funding mechanism soon to be available on Polkadot, devised by [lolmcshizz](https://x.com/lolmcshizz/status/1808832287758237861), called \"Optimistic Project Funding\". This mechanism allows users to nominate whitelisted projects with their DOT. It will be funded with a constant stream of DOT taken directly from inflation and distributed to projects based on the proportion of DOT that has nominated them.\n\nObviously, these guidelines should not be seen as mandatory for all projects developing on Polkadot but rather as a guide for those projects that choose to fund most of their development through the treasury. Of course, there will always be the option to issue own token by accessing private funding methods, as has been the case in 99% of instances to date.\n\nI am collaborating with a group of developers to create a project based on these principles using Polkadot SDK. Although I cannot provide specific details, I can say that it involves an existing Web2 application where blockchain can significantly enhance and improve an already widely-used type of products. This is a crucial point: many projects approach blockchain because it attracts attention, money, and investors, but often blockchain becomes an obstacle during product development, especially if the same product can function effectively without blockchain (even without compromises), or if adopted without considering the necessary requirements for it to function appropriately (decentralization, security, etc.).\n\nI firmly believe in the principles outlined above, and I bring them with me when speaking at conferences, both on stage and at booths, with developers interested in creating their projects on Polkadot.\n\n## My contributions in the Polkadot ecosystem\n\nThat said, let's return to my biography, specifically my involvement in the Polkadot community. Currently, I serve as a curator in three bounties: Marketing Bounty (technical curator), BD Bounty (technical curator), and Meetups Bounty. In the past, with Iceberg Nodes, I was a member (now former member) of the Dot Validator Alliance and Polkadot.Pro. Currently, I am a member of United Block (an alliance of validators and collators in the Polkadot ecosystem providing RPC services to various projects) and a member of Polkadot's 1KV program. Additionally, I am a friend of ChaosDAO members, participate in their public conversations, and Iceberg Nodes is on their trusted validators list.\n\nMy commitment to the Italian Polkadot community began in 2019 when the need arose to establish the Italian Polkadot group. Since then, I have been a co-founder of Polkadot Italia, which now has around 2000 members. I have also founded or become an admin in other Italian groups specific to various parachains. Below, you can find a list (some are very active, others less so, but overall they serve as a point of reference for the Italian community on Telegram regarding Polkadot):\n\n- [Polkadot Network Italia](https://t.me/polkadotnetworkitalia) (now with topics activated)\n- [Kusama Italia](https://t.me/kusama_italia) (read only as archive now —> added to Polkadot Italia group as topic)\n- [Astar Network Italia 🇮🇹](https://t.me/AstarNetwork_IT)\n- [Moonbeam in Italian](https://t.me/moonbeam_it)\n- [BIFROST ITALIA](https://t.me/bifrostitalia)\n- [Acurast Italia](https://t.me/acurast_italia) (NEW)\n- [Manta & Calamari Network Italia](https://t.me/MantaCalamariNetworkItalia)\n- [Substrate’s NFT & RMRK Italia](https://t.me/KANARIAsingularRMRKItalia)\n- [ChainX & SherpaX Italia](https://t.me/Chainx_Italia)\n- [Acala & Karura Italia](https://t.me/acalaitalia)\n- [Polimec 🇮🇹 Italia (Unofficial)](https://t.me/PolimecItalia)\n- [MNET Italia | NUUM & NEER (Previously Bit.Country Italia)](https://t.me/BitCountryItalianCommunity)\n- [KILT Protocol Italia (Unofficial)](https://t.me/KILTProtocolItalia)\n- [Zeitgeist PM Italia](https://t.me/ZeitgeistPMItalia)\n- [Totem.Live Italy 🇮🇹](https://t.me/TotemLiveItalia)\n- [OAK Network in Italiano](https://t.me/OAKitaliano)\n- [Aventus Italia](https://t.me/AventusItalia)\n- [Pendulum & Amplitude Italia](https://t.me/PendulumAmplitudeItalia)\n- [Composable Finance & Picasso Italia](https://t.me/ComposableItalia)\n- [Interlay | Kintsugi IT](https://t.me/Interlay_IT_Community)\n\nIn these groups, it is common to come across my voice messages, which can last several minutes, covering various topics related to the Polkadot world. These include comments on individual referendums, viewpoints on various articles, updates on new announcements made at Polkadot events, and more. I also regularly organize live sessions for in-depth discussions or updates on specific Polkadot-related topics.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/J77r20R/12522-Iceberg-Nodes-1721054345286.jpg)\n> Probably, my voice messages about Polkadot even reached the ears of my girlfriend, who gifted me an handmade hoodie with the Polkadot logo.\n\nBeing not a developer, my “operative” contributions have been very limited, specifically:\n\n- For the Polkadot.pro community: I developed a Telegram bot, which can be considered a precursor to the current [DozeNodes tool](https://www.dozenodes.com/polkadot). This bot showed the list of validator elections for Polkadot and Kusama, based on Phragmén's method.\n\n- For the Kanaria (RMRK) community, a very pioneering NFT project based on the on-chain “graffiti” tech, which is very original though somewhat limited. I created a bot that allowed users to trade emoticons on their eggs without knowing each other, interacting asynchronously through a Telegram bot. This bot is no longer active, as it was specific to a certain phase of the project (the \"emote\" phase of the eggs), but it is still accessible and will respond with a greeting message: https://t.me/KanariaEmoteSwapsBot\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/xXjsTVp/12522-Iceberg-Nodes-1721058286311.jpg)\n\nBecause I have held this role as a point of reference for the Italian Polkadot community over the years, and because I often manage various groups related to Polkadot and its parachains, I have been invited several times by Italian YouTubers (or so-called KOLs) to talk about Polkadot during their live sessions or recordings. Below, you can find a list of these interventions:\n\n- [POLKADOT E KUSAMA: TUTTO quello che DEVI SAPERE ed è IN ARRIVO NEL 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdfOpi47iWw)\n- [🔥 POLKADOT LIVE: QUALE FUTURO CI ATTENDE? 🔥 DOMANDE E RISPOSTE con LUCA POGGI - Polkadot Italia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWA8zxpb_JQ)\n- [Il Salottino Crypto - I SEGRETI di POLKADOT - con Luca Poggi [S02E10]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA4db_beEfc)\n- [POLKADOT RESUSCITA ?

If my candidacy is successful, I will further commit to attending more Polkadot events worldwide.\n\nIn Italy, together with the team I am running with, we have organized several events where I have represented Polkadot both on stage and by answering questions from investors, developers, and users at our stand. So far, we have successfully participated as official Polkadot representatives (with an official stand and sponsorship) at three events: Blockchain Week Rome 2023 (BWR23), Crypto Expo Milan 2023 (CEM23), and the latest edition of Blockchain Week Rome 2024 (BWR24). We have two more events planned for this year, with possibly more if the candidacy is successful.

This is my application as Polkadot Head Ambassador.\n\n## Background\n\nIn Polkadot, I co-founded [ChaosDAO](https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) and [OpenGov.Watch](http://OpenGov.Watch). I am a Web3 strategist specializing in ecosystem development, governance, analytics, and crypto-economics. I previously held CIO and CMO roles and have a systems architecture and political communications background. I hold an MSc in Knowledge Management and IT Security. My master’s thesis explored agile software development and governance practices in open-source communities.\n\n## My previous work for Polkadot\n\n**Some highlights:**\n\n- Curating a decentralized [Polkadot 2.0 Strategy](https://www.notion.so/Polkadot-2-0-Strategy-264b338f38184248acbf630879f8386f?pvs=21) to ensure that all essential functions for growing the ecosystem are covered and we develop a shared direction\n- Representation at conferences/events such as Polkadot Decoded, Sub0, Parachain Summit, DOTBrno, DOTPrague, and local meetups\n- Lecturing at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy on the topics of OpenGov and Tokenomics\n- Moderating the monthly Technical Fellowship OpenDev call\n- Co-Founded ChaosDAO\n\nI am curating a dedicated page with more info about my portfolio. Check it out here:\n\n[Portfolio Tommi](https://www.notion.so/Portfolio-Tommi-822c27eb404941a3a7959a35b805d81d?pvs=21) \n\n## How I see the Head Ambassador Role\n\nThings I expect from Head Ambassadors:\n\n- Role model: Authentically represent the values and virtues of Polkadot and Web3\n- Evangelist: Be in the field (online and offline) and campaign for Polkadot\n- Mentor: Personally help ambassadors and community members better understand Polkadot and empower them to represent it to others.\n- Magician: Understand that your actions are the cause for new things to happen. A single conversation can spark a new project create a lead for a new deal or inspire someone to achieve great things. Actively use your powers to make good things happen.\n\nAs such, these are also the things I strive to do.\n\n## My Offer as Head Ambassador\n\n- **Shape the Ambassador program:** Old and new ambassadors are coming together to create something great. I want to help shape the program and set it up to become a successful organization. Head Ambassadors have to work as a team, so we need to establish the proper culture from the start. Different Head Ambassadors have different strengths, so I will offer mine and look for the strengths of others.\n- **Teach Web3 values:** I am a fundamentals guy. The tech is changing the world, no matter how much degens cry about prices and the latest hot shit, etc... I educate about why we build Web3 and connect the dots to the bigger themes. This is not only important for newbies, but especially for everyone deciding to “grow up” and take Web3 seriously. Mentoring people on this journey takes time and we need to commit to giving ambassadors the time and attention they deserve on their path.\n- **Ambass:** At the moment, I represent Polkadot mostly via Social Media (Twitter, a bit of LinkedIn) and through irregular video production.\n    - **Video Production:** If elected Head Ambassador, my main focus for evangelization would be through content production. I would ramp up my video production again to regularly produce videos on fundamental questions and educational topics in the Polkadot space. The themes would be the current big discussions of Polkadot since I believe that agenda-setting and influencing the narrative is a core responsibility for ambassadors.\n    - **Conferences/Events:** I also represent Polkadot on stage at conferences as opportunities open up. My main topics are introductions to Polkadot, Polkadot Strategy, and OpenGov.\n    - **Business Development:** I have 2 years of Web3 BD experience, but wouldn’t make it an emphasis of my term. I believe quite a few other HA candidates are better able to serve the time required to do proper BD. My focus here would be to capture leads when they present themselves and then relay them to the relevant parties. One way I proactively approach in small but hopefully effective ways is that I throw out ideas that I think OpenGov would fund if someone bites help them move along (for example here baiting with a [Cardano-Polkadot](https://x.com/alice_und_bob/status/1786145294536643038) bridge and then supporting the project once it starts [here](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/cardano-polkadot-bridge/8543))\n\n## Modalities\n\n### Compensation\n\nAt the moment, I have a contract with the Web3 Foundation as part of Decentralized Futures and I do not require additional pay. Under the current situation, I would not use the compensation as salary. I would only use it to pay for operational costs like content production & traveling to events where I represent Polkadot. The primary focus would be to hire a video producer to ramp up production.\n\n### Available Time\n\nI work exclusively for Polkadot. I consider my main line of work at the moment as ecosystem development, which consists of solving problems, analyzing things, and sharing knowledge.\n\nI spend significant time preparing and presenting presentations for conferences as well as agenda-setting and narrative development on Twitter, so imo there is a strong synergy to the role. I believe that the Ambassador program is very important for the community development of Polkadot and will provide the time that the role requires to help it come to fruition.\n\nIf it turns out that my other responsibilities are not compatible time-wise or a larger part of the community is not happy with my performance, I will offer the place to someone else.\n\nI am in the process of proposing a new Ecosystem Development Collective which I hope to co-lead. Should that situation become a reality and be incompatible with the HA role, I will also give the HA spot to the next candidate.",

      "content": "Dear Polkadot community,\n \nI am Siyu Liu, and this is my application for the position of Polkadot Head Ambassador.\n \n![](https://i.ibb.co/9TzvxMs/Wechat-IMG48.jpg)\n \nI hold a master degree of finance from Peking University and I’m also a graduate of Polkadot Blockchain Academy in Hong Kong. I entered the web3 industry in 2017 and have been engaged in investment and incubation in the web3 industry. I founded an incubator called Web3Link, which is committed to helping blockchain projects in providing one-stop solutions such as fund-raising, marketing, community-operating, and listing.\n \nOur recent incubated projects include:\n \nNebula Revelation (web3 space-themed open world game, X:@NBLGAME, www.nebularevelation.com),\n \nVoiceStreet (music-based gamefi metaverse game, X:@VS_ArkOfPanda, www.arkofpanda.vsnft.org),\n \nTrendx (web3 investment information platform, X:Trendx_offical, www.app.trendx.tech), etc.\n \nEvery year, more than 100 projects apply to join the web3link incubator, which has become the vantage for my applying for Polkadot Head Ambassador -- bringing more projects to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n \n**Why choose me?**\n \n**1**. Chinese people have always been important participants in the Polkadot ecosystem. In Polkadot ecosystem, there have been a large number of Chinese founders and developers, as well as many believers and holders from China. However, the market popularity of Polkadot in China has declined since the Polkadot Parachain Auction.\n \nAs an early holder of dot, I have never sold my dot and have actively participated in staking on Acala, Bifrost and Parallel (12uMmwxjpbntEkvfHDgb9Kdpeo98LNsj7KRLKMMqq4BdG5Qz). As most dot holders, I believe that Polkadot will definitely gain higher market popularity and project participation than before the Parachain Auction.\n \nSuch expectancy is closely related to the prosperity of the Chinese market. I have the ability to assist Polkadot to business-develop more Chinese founders through incubators and recruit them into the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n**2**. Web3link and I have established an investment alliance consisting of dozens of investment institutions including Binance Labs, OKX Ventures, Hashkey Capital, etc., which will provide financing docking for the projects in Polkadot ecosystem and the projects that are about to enter the ecosystem. Obtaining funds is extremely important for every project founder, but it is our advantage. We can effectively help project founders obtain funds quickly.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/mzW4R3h/Wechat-IMG55.jpg)\n \n**3**. We can provide a series of technical courses for the founders selected for the incubator, can invite founders from Polkadot ecosystem and Oneblock+ developer community members to give lectures, to explain Polkadot's technical route, and to guide them to use Polkadot SDK for their projects. We can also provide these project founders with courses in financing, marketing and legal compliance, to make Web3link a Chinese version of Polkadot Blockchain Academy.\n \n**4**. I have established a community containing hundreds of Chinese KOLs, and [here is a list of KOLs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ajjLsfTk8k_d1FT4yhNGVdWtimvWPzcz5A-zJ90y24/edit). This community can effectively help Polkadot increase exposure and publicity.\n \n**5**.I am also an entrepreneur in the field of Fintech. In 2017, I was selected into the Forbes 30 Under 30 China List. I founded the Angelstreet in 2014, which was one of the earliest equity crowdfunding platforms in China. It helped more than 50 projects to obtain equity crowdfunding financing.\n \n![](https://i.ibb.co/tYVCF00/Wechat-IMG53.jpg)\n \nIn 2015, I founded Credit Wallet, which was based on Finance + AI. It used tens of thousands of risk factors and risk control models to quickly evaluate users' credit, helping most Chinese people without credit records to obtain financial services. It helped more than 5 million users. The entrepreneurial experience in the field of Fintech has made me better understand how to help a project from 0 to 1. I also hope to bring my successful experience in web2 to web3 to achieve mass adoption of the Polkadot.\n \n**In addition**, I also want to deploy a project I founded, \"Postman Protocol\", in the Polkadot ecosystem. Postman Protocol is a new email service protocol that combines blockchain technology and traditional SMTP protocol, aiming to improve the security, privacy protection and user experience of email transmission. Through innovations such as decentralized account management, peer-to-peer encryption and blockchain stamps, the protocol solves the challenge of security vulnerabilities and efficiency issues in current email services, and promotes the development of the ecosystem through token incentives. [Here is the white paper of \"Postman Protocol\"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fVlpemb4wkmfMrnLGjbJZQZUs8tfp-xOf_ArD1Mluw/edit), and I hope to get your suggestions.\n \n**Work Agenda Summary**\n \n• Represent Polkadot to participate in activities in China and ASEAN.\n \n• Hold Polkadot technology meetings every month to guide more developers and entrepreneurs to join the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n• Establish Polkadot China Incubator to provide systematic blockchain courses for project founders who join the incubator, and help them raise funds, build teams, and enter the secondary market.\n \n• Business-develop more mature blockchain projects into the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n• Business-develop more Chinese KOLs to participate in discussions on the Polkadot ecosystem, to bring more media and community exposure, and to develop more Dot holders from China.\n \n• Connect Polkadot with the Hong Kong government.\n \n**Conclusion**\n \nMy purpose of becoming the Polkadot Head Ambassador is very clear, which is to develop the chinese market for Polkadot. I will not only help One Block+ attract more developers, but also help them use Polkadot SDK to start projects, build teams, obtain financing, and enter the secondary market. Meanwhile, I will also hold Polkadot technical meetings in China every month to increase the exposure of Polkadot in China and to create a more prosperous Polkadot supporter community.\n \nI am a dot holder, and now I need the support of holders. I can be contacted at any time on Tg: @yuge18 or X: @yuge188.\n \nWarm regards, Siyu Liu",

I founded an incubator called Web3Link, which is committed to helping blockchain projects in providing one-stop solutions such as fund-raising, marketing, community-operating, and listing.\n \nOur recent incubated projects include:\n \nNebula Revelation (web3 space-themed open world game, X:@NBLGAME, www.nebularevelation.com),\n \nVoiceStreet (music-based gamefi metaverse game, X:@VS_ArkOfPanda, www.arkofpanda.vsnft.org),\n \nTrendx (web3 investment information platform, X:Trendx_offical, www.app.trendx.tech), etc.\n \nEvery year, more than 100 projects apply to join the web3link incubator, which has become the vantage for my applying for Polkadot Head Ambassador -- bringing more projects to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n \n**Why choose me?**\n \n**1**. Chinese people have always been important participants in the Polkadot ecosystem. In Polkadot ecosystem, there have been a large number of Chinese founders and developers, as well as many believers and holders from China. However, the market popularity of Polkadot in China has declined since the Polkadot Parachain Auction.\n \nAs an early holder of dot, I have never sold my dot and have actively participated in staking on Acala, Bifrost and Parallel (12uMmwxjpbntEkvfHDgb9Kdpeo98LNsj7KRLKMMqq4BdG5Qz). As most dot holders, I believe that Polkadot will definitely gain higher market popularity and project participation than before the Parachain Auction.\n \nSuch expectancy is closely related to the prosperity of the Chinese market. I have the ability to assist Polkadot to business-develop more Chinese founders through incubators and recruit them into the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n**2**. Web3link and I have established an investment alliance consisting of dozens of investment institutions including Binance Labs, OKX Ventures, Hashkey Capital, etc., which will provide financing docking for the projects in Polkadot ecosystem and the projects that are about to enter the ecosystem. Obtaining funds is extremely important for every project founder, but it is our advantage. We can effectively help project founders obtain funds quickly.\n \n**3**. We can provide a series of technical courses for the founders selected for the incubator, can invite founders from Polkadot ecosystem and Oneblock+ developer community members to give lectures, to explain Polkadot's technical route, and to guide them to use Polkadot SDK for their projects. We can also provide these project founders with courses in financing, marketing and legal compliance, to make Web3link a Chinese version of Polkadot Blockchain Academy.\n \n**4**. I have established a community containing hundreds of Chinese KOLs, and [here is a list of KOLs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10ajjLsfTk8k_d1FT4yhNGVdWtimvWPzcz5A-zJ90y24/edit). This community can effectively help Polkadot increase exposure and publicity.\n \n**5**.I am also an entrepreneur in the field of Fintech. In 2017, I was selected into the Forbes 30 Under 30 China List. I founded the Angelstreet in 2014, which was one of the earliest equity crowdfunding platforms in China. It helped more than 50 projects to obtain equity crowdfunding financing.\n \n![](https://ibb.co/QCYmWX4)\n \nIn 2015, I founded Credit Wallet, which was based on Finance + AI. It used tens of thousands of risk factors and risk control models to quickly evaluate users' credit, helping most Chinese people without credit records to obtain financial services. It helped more than 5 million users. The entrepreneurial experience in the field of Fintech has made me better understand how to help a project from 0 to 1. I also hope to bring my successful experience in web2 to web3 to achieve mass adoption of the Polkadot.\n \n**In addition**, I also want to deploy a project I founded, \"Postman Protocol\", in the Polkadot ecosystem. Postman Protocol is a new email service protocol that combines blockchain technology and traditional SMTP protocol, aiming to improve the security, privacy protection and user experience of email transmission. Through innovations such as decentralized account management, peer-to-peer encryption and blockchain stamps, the protocol solves the challenge of security vulnerabilities and efficiency issues in current email services, and promotes the development of the ecosystem through token incentives. [Here is the white paper of \"Postman Protocol\"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fVlpemb4wkmfMrnLGjbJZQZUs8tfp-xOf_ArD1Mluw/edit), and I hope to get your suggestions.\n \n**Work Agenda Summary**\n \n• Represent Polkadot to participate in activities in China and ASEAN.\n \n• Hold Polkadot technology meetings every month to guide more developers and entrepreneurs to join the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n• Establish Polkadot China Incubator to provide systematic blockchain courses for project founders who join the incubator, and help them raise funds, build teams, and enter the secondary market.\n \n• Business-develop more mature blockchain projects into the Polkadot ecosystem.\n \n• Business-develop more Chinese KOLs to participate in discussions on the Polkadot ecosystem, to bring more media and community exposure, and to develop more Dot holders from China.\n \n• Connect Polkadot with the Hong Kong government.\n \n**Conclusion**\n \nMy purpose of becoming the Polkadot Head Ambassador is very clear, which is to develop the chinese market for Polkadot. I will not only help One Block+ attract more developers, but also help them use Polkadot SDK to start projects, build teams, obtain financing, and enter the secondary market. Meanwhile, I will also hold Polkadot technical meetings in China every month to increase the exposure of Polkadot in China and to create a more prosperous Polkadot supporter community.\n \nI am a dot holder, and now I need the support of holders. I can be contacted at any time on Tg: @yuge18 or X: @yuge188.\n \nWarm regards, Siyu Liu",

      "content": "                                                  ![image.png](https://i.ibb.co/H4XDnNK/image.png)  \n  \n  \nHi Polkadot,\n\nMy name is Andréa Vistoli, also known in the community as DonDiegoSanchez.\n\nWe, the DAO, are accomplishing something no other ecosystem nor organization has performed this far, and we’re innovating even more. What we're building has no precedent, no model, and we're following our own path. We're decentralization pioneers, building the future backend of a global economy.\n\nOur ambassadors should fit this reality; they need to be bold, connected, able to innovate, disrupt and try again. This new program is an excellent opportunity for our ecosystem to mature as OpenGov has left a lot of blind spots. It's up to the new team to identify, analyze and try to address them and, if not lead, at least guide our ecosystem.\n\nI'm 40 years old, father of two, pre-redenomination holder, ecosystem agent, serial business founder, former Emmy’s nominee film producer, decentralization cultist, cofounder of a French regulated CASP and I’m facing government bodies, lobbies, medias, listed company and SMEs on a regular basis for the last two years.\n\nI will make an excellent Head Ambassador, I have the vision, the skills, the shoulders to do it and my nonce speaks for me.\n\nI'm a leader, a creator, a process-maker, a true decentralization zealot, and I want to help to build what I hope will become an example for web3, but also for the rest of the world.\n\nI have a wide range of skills and experiences in business, organization, management, regulation, networking, distributed systems and decentralization logic that will be essential to the success of the new program. I'm at the forefront of user adoption, both retail and institutional, through companies I've built. I'm also right in the trenches when it comes to regulation, compliance and lobbying in the wider European zone. My role as co-founder of ChaosDao has also given me acquaintance with a very large sample of the various personalities responsible for making what Polkadot is today, making me quite aware of the struggles and barriers faced by those building it or on it.\n\nI intend to represent Polkadot where it matters most, in the true sense of an ambassador, to the many institutions and actors of the European market. My unique mix of qualities and experiences make me suitable and credible to represent Polkadot in front of listed companies, financial players, lobbies and governments, both to defend it and to help people understand and adopt it.\n\nI also intend to help my fellow Head Ambassadors improve the program. We can build something completely new, transparent and efficient like the technology we will represent. Fueled by the highest expectations of our fellow token holders and built on the same ethos and foundations as Polkadot. Bold, hydrated and decentralized to actually help drive adoption, improve the community sentiment but also be the showcase of what a decentralized organization can achieve.\n\nFinally, I intend to look after my domestic community and market from a business development and user success perspective. I will continue the work that we have already started with some other members of the French-speaking community. We are creating a welcoming and transparent online space supported by the Polkadot Paris Hub, a physical space acting as a real life outpost for the community and the HeadQuarters for our BD activities.\n\nI’ll be attending the EthCC and Decoded for those that will want to meet with me. I’m always available on Discord and Tg : @dondiegosanchez or on X : @SanchezCrypto\n\nYou can find my full application here :  [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sRN0uOS1xLFIjfK51BolNsqZjh7M-OUg5XX79OqkKHs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sRN0uOS1xLFIjfK51BolNsqZjh7M-OUg5XX79OqkKHs/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Proposal - Lucy Coulden",
      "content": "**Head Ambassador Proposal - Lucy Coulden**\n\n**X:** @lucycoulden\n\n**[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-coulden-a64b462a/?originalSubdomain=uk)**\n\n**Discord:** lucycoulden57130\n\n**TG:** @lulu\\_clden\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/xhw7SfQ/Screenshot-2024-07-08-at-20-01-52.png)\n\nHey, Lucy here, taking the plunge and putting myself forward with the ambition of becoming a significant contributor towards this exciting new rollout of the Head Ambassador program. I started thinking about writing this proposal when I left my role at Parity in March 2024. Four months, five countries, many conferences, events and support later, it is time for me to pin my face to the OpenGov wall and take my shot!\n\n**Intro & Professional Background**\n\nMany of you will already know me (hopefully!), but here's a brief introduction & background to myself: I live in London and worked at Parity from March 2022 to March 2024, initially as an Executive Assistant to Bjorn Wagner (CEO, co-founder of Parity Technology & WEB 3 advisor), and later as Director of Executive Operations. Prior to this, I worked at Improbable (a Gaming turned Metaverse-focused company), supporting the C-suite team and at Atomico (a VC firm) supporting CEO Niklas Zennström. Befor tech, I also have spent 5 years in the Private Equity world, supporting both IR and Deal teams and earlier, in recruitment & BD. There have been some calls to share CVs so [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vzDF76y_bwAcEvDkYjYkVEP6eGhIygtd/view?usp=drive_link) is the unabridged version of my along with my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucy-coulden-a64b462a/?originalSubdomain=uk).\n\nA constant thread throughout my career has been my gravitation towards forging and nurturing relationships, without prejudice. Regardless of role, seniority, internal or external, I am passionate about people and really getting under the skin of every business that I have chosen to become a part of. With Polkadot, that driver has been stronger than ever, which has led, in particular, to me spending the past few months submerged in the organized chaos that is this beautiful community, working together with a number of teams on event production and delivery, DF funding proposals and navigating the system, solidifying and growing my network so that when the time is right, I can utilize every tool that I have in my kit to bring new teams, cash and passionate people into our ecosystem.\n\nWhilst at Parity, I worked closely with senior management on a daily basis. My role very much evolved over time as as I outgrew the remits of an Executive Assistant and pushed to become increasingly more involved with key relationship management, centered on nurturing existing relationships with major Polkadot stakeholders and subsequently curating events specifically focused on engaging investors with the ecosystem, the momentum of which I continue to build upon.\n\nAs part of the ongoing changes, it was foreseeable the my role at Parity was destined to be ‘decentralized along with many others and with this in mind, I began to formulate ideas about how I could strengthen my position with the community and expand on my work at Parity to be able to contribute most thoughtfully and successfully to Polkadot as a whole. After leaving Parity in March, on excellent terms with the concrete backing of management to remain - and hopefully flourish! - in the ecosystem, I was locked in!\n\nWhilst being fairly entrenched in the space for two years, I have not been active in OpenGov for anywhere near as long as some of you, however, as part of my now new independent role, I am extremely eager to get stuck in, looking to delve into, engage & contribute to new facets of the ecosystem. Which brings us to today and what I hope is the serendipitous timing of this exciting, forward-looking vision of the Ambassador program.\n\n**What can I offer and how would I look to deliver the most from the role?**\n\nAs touched on, I left Parity with strong networks but also a lot of continued support from key figures and I believe that I am particularly well-positioned to leverage this and to hit the ground running on the BD and VC side of the business. As well as having unique and direct communication lines with notable figures within Parity and the Web3 Foundation through my central role there, I have already fostered valuable, ongoing relationships with HNW and influential people both deeply embedded within the Polkadot universe and those circling it.\n\nAs part of the HA role, I am very confident that I have the networks and skills needed to individually foster and bring in the right types of new partnerships and business opportunities that will bring continued success. Alongside this, I am determined to build upon the previously mentioned **investor events blueprint** that I had started running with Parity. My aim is to deliver impeccably curated investor events as well as networking opportunities for founders and builders, running both more intimate VIP-style mixers as well as more relaxed events running alongside the main Polkadot and other Blockchain Festivals, of which I already have connections and past experience attending / organizing for.\n\nThe first of this series kicked off at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA) at Berkeley University, USA in August 2023. I led the event from conception through to delivery and post event follow-up and analysis. Here, we brought three distinctive groups of people together: Polkadot Founders (current and those on the Founders Track programme at PBA), Polkadot senior leadership and external investors (largely CEO / C-Suite representatives from Silicon Valley based companies). Attendees included Dr. Gavin Wood, Rob Habermeier, Bjorn Wagner, parachain leadership, including Unit Network, Nodle, KILT, Oak Capital, InvArch, and C-Suite members from Dragonfly, Goldman Sachs, Polychain, Kraken and others (25 institutions in total). There was a cocktail mixer, followed by a private dinner with a smaller group of people.\n\nWith this vision in mind, I had preliminary conversations with some of the main teams currently behind organizing and running Polkadot events and our presence at global events. I have been met with sincere encouragement and excitement for my vision of working synergistically with them. To that end, I am hosting the Venture Hub lounge and stage at Decoded by Decentered Studios this coming week, where I look forward to seeing many of you, and assisting the Polkabiz and PolkaPort East teams with their Decoded side events.\n\nLeaning into my network going forward, going forward I would look to bring in a notable management presence from within the ecosystem to these events in order to bolster credibility and give the investors/prospective projects we are attracting opportunities for direct engagement with core legacy architects and visionaries of the space.\n\nI aim to create spaces where founders and builders are offered valuable networking experiences with investors, but also a stage and opportunity for our existing ecosystem MVPs to support and offer feedback to other newer prospective businesses that are being introduced to and encouraged to interact with Polkadot. There is a wealth of experience within the Polkadot ecosystem but also a huge space in which new businesses and individuals can prosper - ensuring that these two factions have access to and support each other will have boundless benefits to the community overall.\n\nI also envisage these spaces becoming flagship mixers for other Ambassadors to come together and to also ‘show off’ the community, building excitement with valuable individuals & projects that they are already working on bringing into the space. As well as helping us all in converting warm relationships into future growth, these events would organically attract the attention of exciting new opportunities which we can collectively then start to nurture. Curating and representing these functions from the role as a Head Ambassador would certainly bring them even more credibility and in turn I believe they would provide a lot of benefit and value back to the program and polkadot as a whole.\n\n_An environment known for exciting people and visions will attract the continued attention of serious investors. A space with serious investors will attract exciting visionaries._\n\n**Relevant experience/achievements over the last 2 years, including work post-Parity**\n\n-   2022 Decoded NYC, Speaker Management\n-   Assisted in delivering Polkadot’s event presence at:\n    -   Davos 2022\n    -   Coinbase Consensus 2023\n    -   Proof of Talk Paris 2023\n    -   Web Summit Lisbon 2023\n-   Polkadot Evenings: Investor x Founder (dinners, mixers) - a concept that I created\n    -   2023 PBA Berkeley. Investor x Founder mixer with key Silicon Valley investors including DragonFly, Goldman Sachs, Kraken, Electric Capital, Polychain\n    -   2023 Silicon Valley VIP Investor Dinner. Lead, organized and hosted the event which targeted increased engagement with external Investor pools (with attendance of Dr. Gavin Wood).\n    -   2023 Web3 Summit VIP Investor Dinner. Lead, organized and hosted event with high profile attendees, including Ed Hesse, Bjorn Wagner, Fabian Gompf, Mark Cachia and a number of key target investor groups.\n    -   2024 PBA Hong Kong - Investor x Founder mixer\n-   Pro-actively sought out to re-engage with Parity's Investor Relations professionals of the past to market-map a (to that point undocumented) list of previous and current investors / leads in order to reinvigorate that internal aspect of BD and then begin pinpointing future opportunities.\n-   Opened new and increased lines of engagement between notable larger DOT holders & Parity, documenting current support and access to technical updates, events, and OpenGov and looking engaging with them on how services can be improved/tailored specifically to increase both the value offered and the value they, in turn, could then provide back to the ecosystem.\n-   Organised and hosted a number of intimate leadership retreats & gatherings for key players across Parity and Web3.\n-   **Member of the Investor Relations Society**. Recently completed a number of courses and attended their Annual Summit in London, June 2024.\n-   **Member of the Black Swan Community**\n\nSince leaving Parity in March 2024, I have worked with a number of different projects and attended a number of community and external events with the aim of immersing myself within the wider community, deepening my understanding of the technology and hoping to build upon some of the initiatives I had started.\n\n-   Sub0 Asia, March - speaker management & agenda support\n-   Token2049 Dubai, April - attendee\n-   Decentralised Lugano (Scytale), May - attendee\n-   Polkadot: Dawn of RWAs hosted by Xcavate in London, July - assisted with invitations, attendee coordination, event execution and data gathering post-event 2024\n-   Decoded, July - working with Decentered Studios on delivering Decoded. Managing the Venture Hub and lounge across the two days.\n-   2024 Polkabiz Investor x Founder evening, July - supporting Polkabiz in delivering their first key event since receiving funding\n-   2024 PolkaPort East private investor dinner, July - leveraging my network to assist the team with their event\n\n**Wrapping things up**\n\nBefore starting to write a proposal, it was important to me that I took the time to read over the past wins, difficulties faced and community feedback with the previous Ambassador program to recognize its hard-fought achievements and hope to retain a lot of the value it brought as well as to understanding how the community thought the new program should next evolve and blossom into its new form. More recently, I considered it important to see who else was applying for the new programme in order to ascertain how my skill set would be a welcome and complementary addition.Having done so, I hope to be positioned to provide real value back to the community and genuinely deliver on the vision this new version of the program promises.\n\nI am vehement about continuing a journey within the space to the point where I have self-funded travel and been happy to work for free on all the bits and pieces that I have been involved with since leaving Parity. Whilst I am not yet as known in the ecosystem / governance realm as some other candidates I hope you can see that I am very much ‘on the ground’ and involved in promoting Polkadot however possible. I hope my unique insight and connections will bring a slightly different skill set that is needed and one which can help enhance and complement the work of the other great ambassadors already in place.\n\nI wholeheartedly believe in this program and how much I would be able to contribute to it; whether it's fostering and converting relationships; creating innovative, unifying spaces for the advent of new partnerships and evolution of old or providing whatever necessary support and organizational structure that will be required in order to robustly grow and build out the program past its inception.\n\nIf selected to join the ‘dream team’, I would remain agile and responsive to evolving market dynamics in order to maintain my tenure. I honestly cannot imagine a next chapter I would rather commit my focus to than continuing to work in this arena - hence taking the plunge and putting myself in the firing line (finally!).\n\nIt would be a privilege for the opportunity to give my all in continuing to push Polkadot to the forefront of people's minds and elevating it towards its extraordinary and wonderful potential! I'm here and keen to engage, so please feel free to ask any questions you have, and I will do my very best to answer.\n\nSee y’all at Decoded in Brussels this week!\n\nLucy",

      "content": "![Gavin and I at the acdemy](https://i.ibb.co/DV6KjdQ/16427-Bekka-1720206750780.jpg)\n\nDear Polkadot community,\n\nI'm [Ayomide Bajo(Bekka)(X)](https://x.com/ayomide_bajo) and this is my application for the Polkadot Head Ambassador position.\n\n### About me\n\nAs a developer, I started my journey into the Polkadot ecosystem by applying to the Polkadot Blockchain Academy and becoming a successful graduate in 2023. In the middle of 2023, I became an ambassador and ever since I’ve been contributing to the growth of Polkadot in Africa, writing articles on [my blog](https://dev.to/ayomide_bajo) about Polkadot and representing wherever i attend web3 events, like the one at [devconnect Istanbul](https://x.com/ayomide_bajo/status/1722272797450457500). I’m also a key contributor to Rust Nigeria, one of Africa's strongest Rust communities. Polkadot is built using substrate and substrate is built using Rust.\n\nWith the support of the African community, I created the [official Twitter account for Polkadot Africa](https://twitter.com/AfricaPolkadot) and I’m currently its manager.

In the middle of 2023, I became an ambassador and ever since I’ve been contributing to the growth of Polkadot in Africa, writing articles on [my blog](https://dev.to/ayomide_bajo) about Polkadot and representing wherever i attend web3 events, like the one at [devconnect Istanbul](https://x.com/ayomide_bajo/status/1722272797450457500). I’m also a key contributor to Rust Nigeria, one of Africa's strongest Rust communities. Polkadot is built using substrate and substrate is built using Rust. \n\nWith the support of the African community, I created the [official Twitter account for Polkadot Africa](https://twitter.com/AfricaPolkadot) and I’m currently its manager. I have hosted a few Twitter(X) spaces since then which has brought warmth and growth to the community. I and other African ambassadors have been building Polkadot Africa. \n\nCurrently, I’m working as a technical writer at Polytope Labs. I’m a member of Chaos Dao and also part of H.E.R DAO’s executive team in Nigeria.\n\n### Personal achievements in the web3 space\n- Graduated from the Polkadot Blockchain Academy in 2023 in the Buenos Aires cohort.\n- Onboarded 250+ developers into the [Rust Nigeria online community](https://www.meetup.com/rust-meetup-group/) in less than a year.\n- I started the [Polkadot Africa Twitter](https://twitter.com/AfricaPolkadot) monthly spaces and we have had over 4 meetup events in different parts of Africa since I started building the community.\n- Got elected to be a steward lead in H.E.R DAO Nigeria.\n- Hosted the[ first meetup event in Lagos](https://x.com/ayomide_bajo/status/1799525508381614548) after almost 2 years.\n\n### Experience\n- Previously worked as frontend developer in tech and wrote frontend code for 3 years professionally\n- Picked up technical writing and became a technical writer at Draft.dev\n- Joined the [Rust Nigeria ecosystem](https://x.com/RustNigeria) and grew to become one of its executives.\n- H.E.R DAO Nigeria Lead.\n- Ambassador at Polkadot and Technical ambassador at Phala network\n- Technical writer at Polytope Labs\n\n### Ecosystem achievements\nI created the [Polkadot Africa Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AfricaPolkadot) and since then we’ve had the following growth since i started headlining the community for the past 8 months.\n\n- [Community partnership with Rust Nigeria](https://x.com/africapolkadot/status/1762805631331795406?s=46) for the Twitter space.\n- Monthly Twitter(X) space hosting great minds and curious audiences.\n- The discord server now has some warmth and activity compared to before including the African channel in the global server.\n- The [first meetup in Africa](https://x.com/dr_sirjey/status/1785267053349208319?s=46). Northern, Nigeria.\n- The [second meetup was in Africa](https://x.com/africapolkadot/status/1795041833262747932?s=46). Kampala, Uganda.\n- The [third meetup](https://x.com/africapolkadot/status/1801207939463594365?s=46). Lagos, Nigeria\n- [Northern Nigeria meetup](https://x.com/dr_sirjey/status/1799514827481596185?s=46) for the second time. \n- [Northern Nigeria meetup](https://x.com/web3naija/status/1807808719842836583?s=46) but this time in another location.\n\nThis is just the beginning and we achieved these results with little resources and passionate teammates. I believe with more support from the global community, we will experience bigger growth!\n\n\n### Visions and goals\nTo keep this proposal brief, I created a document highlighting my visions, goals and the [next steps for the African community](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V4FxKbjLtT3riwLIEKMq5PjwrffiHpxv6nyX9wEepvs/edit#heading=h.fztrpba70nqo)\n\n### Conclusion\nWe know Polkadot has the tech. Polkadot powers Depin, AI, Bridges, and Oracles. It is also cheap, fast and great for developers who also want to experiment with advanced ideas on the blockchain.\nWith the help of the community, we can push this out there to Africans and the global community and achieve a community of innovators, community builders, developers, advocates and other different types of contributors.\n\nThank you for reading this far ✨\n\nWarm regards,\nAyomide Bajo(Bekka)\n\n\nP.S. to clarify the rumours about me.

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Application - Mario Schraepen",
      "content": "gm Polkadot friends,\n\nI’m Mario Schraepen, a serial entrepreneur with 11.000 followers on Linkedin, and the CEO of LinkedCar and founder of PolkaBiz. I am a graduate of the PBA in Hong Kong (with distinction!), have a background in IT, and hold an MBA. As a speaker at various (startup) events, including Decoded Brussels, I bring a wealth of experience and a passion for innovation to the table.\n\n![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/1985bf_acabb5a186514f89bbe8bfc860d4b120~mv2.png)\n\nAs the founder of PolkaBiz, Christian Casini and I have successfully launched a program in just 3 months that helps Polkadot starters refine their pitches to attract investors. We collaborate closely with the Polkadot Blockchain Academy, even travelling to Singapore to offer one-on-one assistance to 26 students. At Decoded, PolkaBiz organises a side-investor night with 60 founders and 40 (!!)  investors, followed by a sold-out Groove Night for 300 people.\nI am an active member of various European organisations such as INATBA, MyData Global, EBSI, 2Tokens, the European Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox, Crypto Valley Association and DSSC. I closely follow European regulations like the EU Data Act and eIDAS2, focusing primarily on Europe but remaining open to global opportunities.\nI'm excited to bring my experience and vision to the role of Polkadot Head Ambassador. By consistently prioritising Polkadot, I have earned the community's trust. My collaborative spirit and PBA expertise empower me to effectively communicate Polkadot's strengths and unite diverse individuals toward common goals.\n\n### My Involvement\nI firmly believe that a Head Ambassador (HA) should be a connector, building bridges both internally and externally to attract more people to Polkadot. I have already demonstrated what I can achieve in the short term within Polkadot, and now I want to extend that impact over the long term. One of my ultimate goals is to bring Polkadot believers together. A decentralised community like ours thrives on listening to different perspectives and understanding what drives each person. I am passionate about creating an environment where everyone feels heard and valued, as unity enables us to achieve remarkable things together.\nI also believe that an HA should, when necessary, speak openly and provide critical opinions on OpenGov, always grounded in facts.\n \n### Collaborative Working Groups\nWhile the Head Ambassador is the “face”, the role is far from a one-person job. It involves a collective effort. These selected “senior ambassadors” and “ambassadors” will be divided into various working groups. These meetings will be invitation-only and compensated in DOTs, supporting the ecosystem and recognizing the ambassadors' contributions. This amount will come from the monthly fee I receive as HA.\n\nWorking Groups I propose :\n1. Old Ambassador (Temporary):\nWe shouldn't lose the knowledge and expertise of former head ambassadors. I want to set up meetings to learn from their experiences and challenges. (and eventually pick up where they left)\n2. Investor Relations:\nBy inviting 40 investors to the Decoded event, I am well-positioned to maintain these relationships. Within this working group we want to reduce the pressure on the treasury and connect our Polkadot startups with investors quickly.\n3. Business Development & Marketing:\nOur goal is to promote Polkadot to the outside world, including at external events where I can speak (or other senior ambassadors / ambassadors), and to market our ecosystem effectively. Our marketing message must be consistent; promoting Polkadot as mere \"software\" can be improved. Currently, every treasury request seems to start from scratch. We can definitely optimise this.\n4. Accountability & Reputation Management:\nI strongly advocate for reputation management. Those who positively contribute to the community should be rewarded, while scammers should be removed. I believe in facts and figures, follow-up, and milestone-based payouts to improve our ecosystem.\n5. Ecosystem Support:\nThere are many parachains and applications that are often left alone. We need community assistance to ensure they thrive. Startups need to be visible during webinars or events. In this working group we will discuss how we can achieve more visibility for selected startups/parachains/apps at a fraction of the cost..\n6. Technical Support:\nWhile my technical contribution may be minimal, given my PBA background, I acknowledge its importance and will support it with a working group.  \n \n \nAll findings from the 6 working groups will be discussed centrally with all HAs, allowing us to make better-informed decisions for the community's benefit.\nThank you for considering my application. I am confident that, together with the right senior ambassadors and ambassadors, I can make a positive impact on the ecosystem. I have already demonstrated this over the past few months.\n\n**Please read the full manifesto : **\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sxJLBFqN1cdA4pcq756NN5RCP7GoWVF36rMEeLkWdUM/edit?usp=sharing\n \nWarm regards,\nMario Schraepen\n\n",

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Application - Jimmy Tudeski",
      "content": "**Dear Polkadot Community,**\n\nMy name is Jimmy Tudeski, known as Stakenode (https://x.com/stakenode_dev). With a deep passion for blockchain and a steadfast commitment to the Polkadot ecosystem, I am eager to bring my experience and vision to the role of Polkadot Head Ambassador. I find myself as a Polkadot resident, all my stakes and heart are here, in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nI have consistently prioritized the growth of the Polkadot ecosystem over personal interests. My dedication and passion as an ambassador and my role as a Polkadot and Kusama validator reflect my unwavering commitment. I have earned the trust of the community by always putting Polkadot first. My collaborative spirit and technical expertise enable me to effectively communicate Polkadot's selling points and align diverse individuals toward shared goals.\n\n**My Journey with Polkadot**\n\nI embarked on my journey within the Polkadot ecosystem in May 2020 as an enthusiastic content creator and community supporter. Over the years, I have expanded my roles to parachain and Polkadot ambassador (Senior in the old program), parachains council member, community builder, Polkadot and Kusama validator, and honored representative of Polkadot Decentralized Voices program 1st cohort. My contributions have been diverse, from writing detailed guides, creating educational content, and representing Polkadot at ecosystem events to providing technical support, building the local Polkadot community in Poland, and actively participating in governance.\n\nI believe in the potential of Polkadot technology and the power of the Polkadot community. Through my experience, I know the strength and dedication of this community. I am committed to continuing to build a thriving ecosystem by onboarding competent and passionate Senior Ambassadors and Ambassadors. My mission is to make this program successful and our ecosystem the default choice for builders, larger enterprises, and governments. I aim to make Polkadot an example of the practical benefits that Web3 brings to the world.\n\n**My Head Ambassador Vision and Mission**\n\nThe role of the Head Ambassador is pivotal in shaping the future of the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nNavigating the world of decentralized decision-making can be a bit chaotic, but honestly, I thrive in that environment. Polkadot has been my playground for years, and I've learned a ton about how to make sense of the chaos and turn it into something amazing. One of my ultimate goals is to bring Polkadot people together. A decentralized community like ours is about listening to different perspectives, understanding what drives each person, and finding common ground. I love creating a space where everyone feels heard and valued because we can achieve incredible things when we're united.\n\nI see myself more as a guide and leader. One of my goals is to empower the Polkadot community, giving it the tools and support it needs to shine. Whether mentoring new ambassadors, helping you navigate governance, or just answering questions, I’m here to ensure everyone can contribute their best. The blockchain world is always changing, and I’m all about staying ahead of the curve.\n\nI’m committed to learning and adapting to help guide our community through whatever comes next.\n\nStaying proactive means we can turn potential challenges into new opportunities. By building a strong, united community and embracing the strengths of decentralized decision-making, I believe we can make Polkadot a shining example of what’s possible.\n\n**Education and Technical Translation**\n\nI’m passionate about education and sharing knowledge, especially regarding the amazing stuff happening in the Polkadot ecosystem. Here’s what I’ve got planned to help us all get on the same page and make the most out of Polkadot’s potential:\n\nI’m about to host regular workshops and spaces to explore Polkadot’s architecture, governance, and all the cool things parachains can do. These events will be a great place to learn, ask questions, and get hands-on with the tech.\n\nNavigating the Polkadot ecosystem can be tricky, so I've put together some super practical guides. These will cover everything from using different applications to understanding how Polkadot works. Whether you're a newbie or a seasoned pro, these guides will help you get the most out of the platform.\n\nI love talking about Polkadot and am committed to representing our community at global conferences and events. It’s about spreading the word and raising awareness and understanding of what Polkadot can do. I’ll be there, sharing our story and the amazing potential of our ecosystem.\n\n**Onboarding and Empowerment**\n\nMy biggest goals are to bring in new ambassadors at all levels—seasoned pros or just starting—and get them pumped about driving Polkadot’s growth. Here’s how I plan to make that happen:\n\nOnboarding New Ambassadors - I’m about welcoming new faces into our community. I want to ensure that new ambassadors, whether senior, ambassador-level, or candidates, feel right at home and ready to dive in. I’ll guide them through the onboarding process, answering questions and providing the support they need to hit the ground running. I also want to go back to discussing some initiatives I see opportunities for Polkadot Ambassadors program growth - like the rejected proposal by StakePlus - https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/601 - I feel there is a lot of potential in this proposal when adjusted to Ambassador Program development needs.\n\nEmpowering the Community - Empowerment is key. I believe in giving everyone the tools and resources they need to succeed. By supporting our ambassadors, we can create a ripple effect and positive impact throughout the ecosystem. When each ambassador is equipped and confident, they can do incredible things for Polkadot.\n\nCreating a Strong Network - No single Head Ambassador can do it all, but we can achieve amazing things together. I want to ensure that our group of Ambassadors and Senior Ambassadors has everything they need to be effective and impactful. This means providing training, resources, and a strong support network so we can all learn from each other and grow together.\n\n**Governance and Community Building**\n\nI’ve been deeply involved in Polkadot governance and have a pretty good grasp of how things work around here. Governance is a crucial part of our ecosystem, and I’m super excited to share how I plan to build on this and further strengthen our community. First, having been knee-deep in Polkadot governance and being a representative for the 1st Decentralized Voices cohort, I know the ins and outs of the system. I've seen everything from proposals and referenda to different tracks and OpenGov drama. This experience has given me a solid foundation to help guide others and ensure our governance processes are smooth and effective.\n\nGovernance can be complex, especially for newcomers. We can provide personalized guidance and support by pairing experienced members with new ambassadors. This will help newcomers understand the governance system and become active, informed participants. Inclusivity is key. I’m committed to ensuring everyone, regardless of background or experience level, feels welcome and valued in our community. This means actively reaching out to underrepresented groups and ensuring our governance processes are transparent and accessible to all.\n\nGovernance only works if people participate. I’ll work hard to encourage more community members to participate in governance. This could be through educational initiatives, regular updates on governance matters, and creating easy-to-understand guides on participating in votes and proposals. Governance isn’t just about voting; it’s also about contributing to the ecosystem meaningfully. I’ll lead initiatives encouraging community members to use the OpenGov model to enable collectives and fellowships. I’m committed to continuously seeking feedback from the community and proposing improvements based on that feedback. By staying responsive and adaptive, we can ensure that our governance processes evolve to meet the needs of our growing ecosystem.\n\n**Business Development Focus Areas**\n\nAs a dedicated and passionate advocate for Polkadot, my business development strategy is centered on fostering collaboration and supporting ecosystem agents to drive significant growth and adoption. By working closely with these talented individuals and groups, we can elevate Polkadot as a premier blockchain technology and a leader in the Web3 space. Here’s how I envision how to achieve this together:\n\nSupport agents in highlighting real-world use cases and success stories to showcase Polkadot's decentralized and resilient blockchain solution capabilities and assist in forming alliances with key industry players and governmental bodies globally to promote collaborative projects and initiatives.\n\nBy aligning with principles such as those recently outlined by the Danish FSA - https://www.dfsa.dk/news/2024/jun/crypto-assets_250624, Polkadot can ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks, fostering trust and legitimacy not only within the EU but on a global scale. This proactive approach will position Polkadot at the forefront of the blockchain industry, recognized by governments, enterprises, NGOs, and institutions as a leading decentralized and resilient blockchain platform.\n\n**Positioning Polkadot in the European Blockchain Sandbox**\n\nI aim to position Polkadot in the forthcoming cohorts of the European Blockchain Sandbox, a regulatory sandbox that aims to establish a pan-European framework for regulatory dialogue. This initiative, led by the European Commission, brings together national and EU regulators with providers of innovative blockchain applications to identify possible issues and solutions from a legal and regulatory perspective in a safe and confidential environment. By participating in the European Blockchain Sandbox, Polkadot can Showcase Regulatory Compliance: Highlight Polkadot’s alignment with GDPR, Cyber Security, AML, and MiCAR compliance, demonstrating how it supports efficient and effective compliance and oversight. Promote Innovative Use Cases: Participate in dialogues covering applications like Battery Passports, Cultural Asset Passports, and EU ETS / MRV regulatory areas, showcasing Polkadot’s versatility and applicability across various sectors. Set New Standards: Collaborate with regulators and industry leaders to refine best practices and set new standards for the blockchain industry, particularly in defining and operating compliant DAOs. Polkadot is the world's biggest and most advanced DAO.\n\nThe trajectory of DAOs is set to redefine the future of organizational management and asset control. According to the World Economic Forum, DAOs are the future way of doing business and are transforming corporate formation. The potential for DAO treasuries to grow to USD 10 trillion in the next decade underscores the need for robust, scalable, and secure blockchain solutions like Polkadot. Polkadot’s vision of interoperability, security, scalability, and democratic governance aligns perfectly with the future direction of digital and decentralized organizational structures. As DAOs continue to rise in prominence and asset control, Polkadot is set to be the backbone of this transformative movement, leading the way toward a decentralized, efficient, and secure future. By focusing on these areas and empowering ecosystem agents with innovative initiatives, ideas, and precise proposals, we can drive significant growth and recognition for Polkadot. This strategy will establish Polkadot as a leading blockchain technology, ensuring it remains at the forefront of the Web3 revolution, benefiting developers, businesses, governments, and the global community.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBecoming a Polkadot Head Ambassador is an opportunity to contribute significantly to a project I am deeply passionate about. My dedication to driving the Polkadot ecosystem forward is evident through my full-time commitment and even more than full-time work. I live and breathe Polkadot, dedicating my time and energy to ensure its success and growth. This unwavering dedication allows me to stay proactive, turn challenges into opportunities, and continuously innovate to keep our community ahead of the curve. In addition to my time commitment, I am also committed to financially supporting the growth of our community. I pledge to distribute 30% of my salary to the Polkadot Poland team. This financial contribution aims to build a thriving local community in Poland, fostering collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity. By supporting local initiatives, we can create a strong foundation that benefits the Polish community and contributes to the global Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nThat's it, Folks! Thank you for considering my application.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, I will continue to champion the growth and development of Polkadot in every way I can. My passion for this ecosystem drives me to push forward, even if it means navigating through more challenges and taking longer to achieve our goals. As a dedicated Polkadot Resident and ecosystem agent, I believe in leading by example and inspiring others to join this mission. Your support can turn this vision into reality. Onward and upward,\n\nJimmy Tudeski (Stakenode)",

I have been in the Polkadot ecosystem since 2019, when I was hired by Web3 Foundation as Lead Advisor on the three-year regulatory process with the SEC, which concluded with a statement that Polkadot was no longer a security - it is simply software. This was a true team effort that continues today as we strive to maintain such status. I am submitting my application for the Head Ambassador for Gaming in conjunction with our Dot Play bounty proposal. Any funds received from the treasury for the position of Head Ambassador of gaming would be used to fund a selection of streamers and influencers in gaming, after we educate them on Polkadot!\n\nHere is a link to my proposal: \n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/12et\\_7fsdesB4K0l0DMzfOTvqxbpoQ11uBTTfWYrFP74/edit",

If you believe this should be actionable and have enough DOT to place the DD, I would greatly appreciate it. Otherwise this will be totally inconsequential.\n\n## Summary\n### Objective\nTo be a servant to DOT holders and the Polkadot brand by providing online general & technical support for users, creating content about Polkadot governance & tech, and establishing a strong presence for Polkadot in the United States of America.\n### Offerings\n- Weekday [**office hours**](https://calendar.app.google/q6bZpXG8mkB9vzoWA)\n- [**DOT Take livestream**](https://www.youtube.com/@hotdottake) twice per week (governance coverage)\n- Once per month travel mission within the USA\n- Lead the organization and coordination a DOT conference in the USA 2025\n- Key X Spaces appearances\n- Free bounty curator work\n- Ambassador Program admin & facilitation (Google Drive, meetings, document organization, reports, communications, etc.)\n### Compensation Breakdown\nFirst month: $10,000 to purchase better equipment and relieve financial stress\n\nEvery subsequent month: $80 per hour [**logged**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EDKwipXk_JdnYCsal7yxL7_tepUlzl48Sujm0vwi6F8/edit?usp=sharing) up to $5,000 with the other $5,000 going toward travel expenses and discretionary spending to proliferate the Polkadot brand or hire necessary talent.\n\n14 days PTO per year ($166.66 per day). Unused PTO does not roll over.\n\nUnused discretionary spending funds will be used to buy DOT which will be staked to support a strategic fund.\n### My Story\nMy career has its roots in service, sales, and management. As I gained more experience in these fields, I expanded my career into professional networking, business development, and entrepreneurship/leadership. After graduating from college, I tried my hand in an analytics role within the pharmaceutical industry which gave me a strong foundation in technical writing analysis and finance/accounting in regard to insurance coverage in clinical trials.\n\nWhen my children grew out of infancy, I decided to hang up my professional career and serve tables so that my wife and I wouldn’t have to pay for daycare. This flexibility ultimately led to my entry in the crypto space, though I had some experience in 2016 flipping Bitcoin for cash in downtown St. Paul. I bought some LINK in the fall of 2020 which I sold for KSM in April of 2021 to get a decent self-stake on my validator. I self-taught myself Linux system admin and node management throughout my tenure as a validator and served a long time in the Thousand Validator Program. In the fall of 2021, I decided to quit my job serving tables to focus completely on the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.\n\nIn my time in the ecosystem I’ve been a part of, and founded, many projects. I’ve worked with dozens of professionals including developers, artists, project managers, creative leads, and other founders. Polkadot and Kusama have served as my sandbox where all of my experience and education has come together to coordinate teams, devise programs, build my social media presence, provide well-informed commentary, and disseminate highly technical information to the layman. Additionally, my bold, free-speaking approach has also provided the community with a refreshing perspective on many occasions.\n\nI have a very solid grasp on the happenings of the ecosystem and the sentiments of the community. Patient and persistent participation over the last 3 years has given me a confident insight to what Polkadot needs and how I can help its growth and presence. The culmination of the Ambassador Program and my robust experience in business management, along with the fact that I reside in the USA where Polkadot so desperately needs representation, opens the door to an opportunity where I can fervently serve Polkadot.\n\nMy allegiance is to you, DOT holder.\n\nAdam Clay Steeber",

          "content": "Greetings,\n\nAfter [**polling the community on X**](https://x.com/AdamSteeber1/status/1801295724917010682), I have decided to throw my hat in the ring for Head Ambassador.\n\n[**Full proposal**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TKgDVFaVkhNDl9DlbmFUwtMlyykFI8gOGYaZKgLEDNw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[**Ambassador Program Document**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kBUg8Ahrm5UQJf-zBxvFKmqlVAjDeEz/view)\n\n[**Main DOT Account**](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/15FsX8EdUftorgXBjtgbdD1NesqVPwfJPL79V5JDvk2CCc9x)\n\n[**Proxied Pure to be Promoted**](https://collectives-polkadot.subscan.io/account/127C5Cdq4CnqMP2n2noxoFwHCcoSyMh6Jysk9yJGKRdxdqAe)\n\n## Summary\n### Objective\nTo be a servant to DOT holders and the Polkadot brand by providing online general & technical support for users, creating content about Polkadot governance & tech, and establishing a strong presence for Polkadot in the United States of America.\n### Offerings\n- Weekday [**office hours**](https://calendar.app.google/q6bZpXG8mkB9vzoWA)\n- [**DOT Take livestream**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEVyH-jX-9B3hqC483I-fRw) twice per week (governance coverage)\n- Once per month travel mission within the USA\n- Lead the organization and coordination a DOT conference in the USA 2025\n- Key X Spaces appearances\n- Free bounty curator work\n- Ambassador Program admin & facilitation (Google Drive, meetings, document organization, reports, communications, etc.)\n### Compensation Breakdown\nFirst month: $10,000 to purchase better equipment and relieve financial stress\n\nEvery subsequent month: $80 per hour [logged**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EDKwipXk_JdnYCsal7yxL7_tepUlzl48Sujm0vwi6F8/edit?usp=sharing) up to $5,000 with the other $5,000 going toward travel expenses and discretionary spending to proliferate the Polkadot brand or hire necessary talent.\n\n21-days PTO per year ($166.66 per day)\n\nUnused discretionary spending funds will be used to buy DOT which will be staked to support a strategic fund.\n### My Story\nMy career has its roots in service, sales, and management. As I gained more experience in these fields, I expanded my career into professional networking, business development, and entrepreneurship/leadership. After graduating from college, I tried my hand in an analytics role within the pharmaceutical industry which gave me a strong foundation in technical writing analysis and finance/accounting in regard to insurance coverage in clinical trials.\n\nWhen my children grew out of infancy, I decided to hang up my professional career and serve tables so that my wife and I wouldn’t have to pay for daycare. This flexibility ultimately led to my entry in the crypto space, though I had some experience in 2016 flipping Bitcoin for cash in downtown St. Paul. I bought some LINK in the fall of 2020 which I sold for KSM in April of 2021 to get a decent self-stake on my validator. I self-taught myself Linux system admin and node management throughout my tenure as a validator and served a long time in the Thousand Validator Program. In the fall of 2021, I decided to quit my job serving tables to focus completely on the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.\n\nIn my time in the ecosystem I’ve been a part of, and founded, many projects. I’ve worked with dozens of professionals including developers, artists, project managers, creative leads, and other founders. Polkadot and Kusama have served as my sandbox where all of my experience and education has come together to coordinate teams, devise programs, build my social media presence, provide well-informed commentary, and disseminate highly technical information to the layman. Additionally, my bold, free-speaking approach has also provided the community with a refreshing perspective on many occasions.\n\nI have a very solid grasp on the happenings of the ecosystem and the sentiments of the community. Patient and persistent participation over the last 3 years has given me a confident insight to what Polkadot needs and how I can help its growth and presence. The culmination of the Ambassador Program and my robust experience in business management, along with the fact that I reside in the USA where Polkadot so desperately needs representation, opens the door to an opportunity where I can fervently serve Polkadot.\n\nMy allegiance is to you, DOT holder.\n\nAdam Clay Steeber",

      "content": "Hello, We are core team members at OpenGuild are happy to apply for the Head Ambassador role in the new Ambassador Program in charge of the **Southeast Asia market** fostering the focus of building relationships with Web3.0 builders, organizations, and influencers in the SEA market to elevate the Polkadot ecosystem and Polkadot techstack.\n\n## **CONTEXT - WHAT IS OPENGUILD?**\n\nOpenGuild - An open community driven by Web 3.0 builders elevating Polkadot in Southeast Asia. We find & connect talents in the region and help them become a part of Polkadot to create new value.\n\nOpenGuild Community is run by the OG Core Team, a team of dedicated long-term contributors focusing on exploring market entries and enhancing organization collaboration for Polkadot in Southeast Asia ([**Cris Nguyen](https://x.com/crisnguyen99), [Tin Chung](https://x.com/chungquantin), [Patricia Arro](https://x.com/polka_pat)**).\n\n## **CORE TEAM MEMBERS**\n\nWe have 3 core team members with 4 more executive members in charge of BD, Marketing, Events, and Developer Relations living in SEA countries.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/r71FQBg/4429-Cris-Nguyen-1719135755257.png)\n\n### **Cris Nguyen**\n\nCris has worked in the Polkadot ecosystem for 3 years, where he led the Polkadot Insider team to become the biggest research and educational media platform in the Polkadot community (handed over to the [co-founder](https://x.com/ducky_insider) in January 2024). His focus had been on business development and partnerships, working with multiple para chains and applications by addressing their marketing and community needs and helping them with community campaigns and promotions. Cris is also a prolific connector of the Polkadot ecosystem in Southeast Asia with a focus on partners including VCs, media organizations and communities, and Web3 projects. Cris has successfully organized multiple events on behalf of Polkadot in Southeast Asia with 100+ attendees. He has also been a speaker at various events, bringing Polkadot closer to local crypto communities and becoming the most active ambassador in the region. Cris had a chance to work at Moonbeam Network as a Business Development professional based in Vietnam, focused on building partnerships with builders and facilitating growth for the broader Polkadot ecosystem for 6 months.\n\nAt the current stage, Cris’s focus is Strategy Lead and Operation Manager at OpenGuild to deliver regular workshops, events, hackathons, and technical community calls, becoming the important representative of the Polkadot network in Southeast Asia market and nearly becoming a middle point of contact for Polkadot/Parachain team to any potential vendors in the market.\n\n### **Tin Chung**\n\nTin has participated in a few blockchain hackathons, such as the Chainlink Spring Hackathon 2021, where my team was awarded as the Top Project Winner, and the International Blockchain Olympiad with the Category Award Winner.\n\nRegarding Tin’s professional experience, he has experience working as a software engineer in multiple L1 blockchains, from Ethereum and Solana to Lightning Network L2 solutions on the Bitcoin blockchain, Tin is a former [Coin98 Wallet](https://x.com/coin98_wallet) engineer - one of the biggest wallet in SEA market with 10M+ users and ex-lead engineer at [Snowflake](https://x.com/snowflake_sol) - a multi-sig wallet with total 50M+ TVL at peak on Solana.\n\nIn his past startup working as a software engineer, he developed and maintained open-source SDKs and client libraries in Rust and TypeScript that help developers work with underlying protocols. On the other hand, Tin has spent a lot of time building and contributing to open-source software, especially the Polkadot SDK and Substrate framework for blockchain builders.\n\nAt the current stage, he is a PBA graduate at Singapore Cohort (Wave 5) and Dev Rel Lead at OpenGuild / Polkadot SEA with a focus on preparing technical workshop content, hosting a monthly Hackathon at OpenGuild, in charge of all the technical development. Tin was also a Rust Mentor at [Vietnam Biggest Hackathon](https://x.com/ZKPLabs/status/1792577402943701118) organized by ZKP Labs and GM Vietnam on behalf of Polkadot.\n\n### **Patricia Arro**\n\nPatricia has been in the blockchain space doing community marketing management for over 6 years and has worked for blockchain startups in different industries like agritech, fintech, defi, and top exchanges like Bybit and Crypto.com. Her experience started working for a crypto agency where Patricia was the blockchain educator and trainer of community moderators. This led to acquiring more experience in strategic community management that allowed her to work with Product Managers, Engineers, Dev Rels, Marketing, and Sales.\n\nFast forward to early 2023. Patricia worked at Parity as Polkadot’s APAC Community Manager, managing and growing APAC Ambassadors, activating local communities, and curating events/meetups. During this time, she fostered relationships with local web3 leaders, which now helps boost her current initiatives.\n\nCurrently, Patricia is part of OpenGuild which is mainly focused on growing, educating, and activating Polkadot’s developer communities in Southeast Asia. With this, she’s also representing Polkadot in the region by being invited to speak to multiple blockchain and crypto events like AIBC, Southeast Asia Blockchain Week, Thailand Blockchain Week, Sub0 Asia (as host), and multiple local/Philippine initiatives.\n\n### **WHY DO WE PROPOSE THE HEAD AMBASSADOR ROLE AND HOW WE WILL BE ONE OF THE TOP OPTIONS?**\n\nThe OG Core Team believes that we are one of the most suitable candidates for the Head Ambassador role in Southeast Asia through our **ready-made resources, connections, partners, and diversified skills** within our team. The OG Core Team already has a large number of partners from the Polkadot ecosystem and local partners, with each member having dedicated over 3 years of full-time commitment to contributing to the ecosystem through various initiatives, building relationships, creating mutual values, and partners are always ready to activate most activities related to Polkadot. The team gathers all the necessary skills to perform well in the focused region, including leadership, operation management, strategy, partnership development, marketing and event management, content creation, community management, public speaking, technical knowledge, developer relations, programming, and most importantly, ecosystem skin-in-the-game.\n\nWe have performed the tasks we propose for HA very well in the region as a spirit of Polkadot SEA, but with the Head Ambassador role officially and appropriate resources allocated by collaborating with All Ambassadors in the program, we are confident that we can elevate our work to the next level as our official job build up a strong Polkadot presence and create outcome in SEA.\n\nACCESS OUR [**FULL PROPOSAL**](https://openguild.notion.site/POLKADOT-HEAD-AMBASSADOR-APPLICATION-Cris-Patricia-Tin-Southeast-Asia-focus-b25348871dc04832ab3ac8b99ea4642d) TO SEE THE AMBASSADOR STRATEGY, EXECUTION PLAN, AND HOW WE UTILIZE RESOURCES AND HELP POLKADOT ECOSYSTEM PENETRATE THE MARKET.\n\n*Note: Proposed deliverables on behalf of Ambassadors are not in **ref#409**, but we are convinced OpenGuild core team members have been the important point of contact for anyone to Polkadot in the local market in different areas and still doing it as a spirit of Polkadot SEA contributors. We will utilize OpenGuild’s resources and Ambassador Program’s human resources to help us operate appropriately.*\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/SsZD20C/4429-Cris-Nguyen-1719135785357.png)",

With this, she’s also representing Polkadot in the region by being invited to speak to multiple blockchain and crypto events like AIBC, Southeast Asia Blockchain Week, Thailand Blockchain Week, Sub0 Asia (as host), and multiple local/Philippine initiatives.\n\n### **WHY DO WE PROPOSE THE HEAD AMBASSADOR ROLE AND HOW WE WILL BE ONE OF THE TOP OPTIONS?**\n\nThe OG Core Team believes that we are one of the most suitable candidates for the Head Ambassador role in Southeast Asia through our **ready-made resources, connections, partners, and diversified skills** within our team. The OG Core Team already has a large number of partners from the Polkadot ecosystem and local partners, with each member having dedicated over 3 years of full-time commitment to contributing to the ecosystem through various initiatives, building relationships, creating mutual values, and partners are always ready to activate most activities related to Polkadot. The team gathers all the necessary skills to perform well in the focused region, including leadership, operation management, strategy, partnership development, marketing and event management, content creation, community management, public speaking, technical knowledge, developer relations, programming, and most importantly, ecosystem skin-in-the-game.\n\nWe have performed the tasks we propose for HA very well in the region as a spirit of Polkadot SEA, but with the Head Ambassador role officially and appropriate resources allocated by collaborating with All Ambassadors in the program, we are confident that we can elevate our work to the next level as our official job build up a strong Polkadot presence and create outcome in SEA.\n\nACCESS OUR [**FULL PROPOSAL**](https://openguild.notion.site/POLKADOT-HEAD-AMBASSADOR-APPLICATION-Cris-Patricia-Tin-Southeast-Asia-focus-b25348871dc04832ab3ac8b99ea4642d) TO SEE THE AMBASSADOR STRATEGY, EXECUTION PLAN, AND HOW WE UTILIZE RESOURCES AND HELP POLKADOT ECOSYSTEM PENETRATE THE MARKET.\n\n*Note: Proposed deliverables on behalf of Ambassadors are not in **ref#409**, but we are convinced OpenGuild core team members have been the important point of contact for anyone to Polkadot in the local market in different areas and still doing it as a spirit of Polkadot SEA contributors. We will utilize OpenGuild’s resources and Ambassador Program’s human resources to help us operate appropriately.*\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/SsZD20C/4429-Cris-Nguyen-1719135785357.png)",

      "content": "If I am elected a Head Ambassador (HA) for Polkadot, I will be 100% Dedicated to the Role. Knowing that I am no longer just representing myself, but a brand, which is Polkadot & Jam technology! I am an extremely passionate representative of Polkadot who resides in North America, US. \nTo me the Head Ambassadors are not just faces, but speakers, strategists, facilitators of sales initiatives, internal processes and servicing the community. We lead, support and bring forth positive changes based on the best interests of Polkadot, Jam and its community.\n•\tHere is a bit of the contribution I have made to Polkadot thus far; https://forum.polkadot.network/t/decoded-2024-sponsorship-for-active-community-members/7654/30?u=hopeclary \n•\tI understand I will be an ambassador to Polkadot’s best interests. I currently see this, but not limited to: Gaming, AI, Governess, CoreTime, Bridging Partnerships, facilitating trust within WEB3 and sharing benefits in normal relatable services of current WEB2 to facilitate transitions into WEB3.  \n•\tI am technical, experienced with legal negotiations & contracts in addition to translating to normie speak. Past work roles for a Network Switching Company: Corparate Technical Trainer, QA, Product Delivery, Product Manager, Product Strategy, Product Analyst. \no\tI will represent Polkadot HA on www.linkedin.com/in/hope-goodman-49217730 LinkedIn. Having worked for a fortune 100 US company for over 20+ years. I was Product Delivery for Apple Pay in the US for this Network Switching Services company, they’re the WEB2 layer 0 equivalent of Polkadot for financial transactions. Meaning, we routed transactions from point-of-sale devices through Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover and banking network funnels for approval and denial of a consumers purchases. When meeting people, if asked what I do for a living, I would share my past job experience & lead into my current role as a Polkadot HA. I will be describing what Polkadot is to businesses and the functions we provide through WEB3…. Connecting Polkadot to real world adoption, awareness & usage.\no\tI can do presentations, write/collaborate on working legal agreements, and go after leads that would benefit Polkadot. I am actively going for additional collaboration initiatives for Polkadot that would help put us in the spotlight.\n•\tI would like to mirror a BD team like Brazil in the US, or work with this high performing team on US initiatives, as they’re part of the America’s. I understand big deals are never done alone! In addition, it has been my experience that specific skills are needed for these teams to be successful. \n•\t My goal as HA, for our HA team is to facilitate & support these initiatives. When working with global companies having representatives in multiple areas of the globe 🌐 will be beneficial. \no\tSuccess for global adoption of CoreTime and other products on-chain, we can introduce to businesses big and small, create strategies to execute upon! Example: reach out to local municipalities to see how various charity DAO’s within Polkadot may be of service in local communities. \no\tBeyond just charities, I see ways as a HA Team we can work to get positive media attention and connect with specific groups in our areas to help drive Polkadot forward for a WEB3 revolution! \n•\tI would represent Polkadot to my Politicians, locals & in Washington DC. Living in the Miami Florida Metro area. We’re Bitcoin adaptive here (Bitcoin Bull in Financial District), I will work to drive more Polkadot adoption. Very large enterprises are moving to this area including Asset Management companies and other Fortune 500 companies in addition to TV & Movie Studio’s. As a HA Team we would collaborate on appropriate BD initiatives. \no\tI would welcome working closely and collaborating with legal counsel to facilitate deals & lobbying where appropriate.\n•\t At times I will connect proposals or ideas to products within the ecosystem. I will make product recommendations & work with other talented people to make them a reality. New Product Ideas, Testing, Feedback, making introductions & pitches. Whatever is in the best interest of Polkadot and Jam!\n•\tWith access to footage, I would make appropriate presentations and commercials.\n•\t Attending and creating events locally in addition to Crypto Conferences and Conferences of industries we’re looking to break into, or expand in. \n•\t Create In person and online engagements to connect with other Crypto communities to facilitate collaboration & trust.\n•\t Continued Participation in video meetings for Polkadot and Jam initiatives, Polkadot Forum, Telegram & helping people navigate all things Polkadot and Jam.\n•\t Continued work on Bounties. \n•\t As HA I would always be open to connecting and creating collaborations with other Crypto Ecosystems, Participants and Products because Polkadot is the WEB3 Layer 0!\n",

          "content": "**Polkadot Head Ambassador of East Asia: Team SubStake (Rhee & Raf)**\n\nGreetings Polkadot!\n\n**- Who is Rhee? -**\nMy name is \"Rhee\" (ex-Parity EcoDev), also an old-time Polkadot Head Ambassador of East Asia. And here I am re-applying for the Head Ambassador representing East Asia, AGAIN, as I’ve always been.\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYjmeTRcPFAeiEq9Y3H2FZjfFKaqnuZT1uxxzEMWXR7D5)\n\nI joined the Polkadot ecosystem in 2019 as an Ambassador Candidate, climbed the ladder to become a Head Ambassador East Asia from 2021 until now, and I'd like to keep contributing through this role, since at least everyone is still recognizing me as the Head Ambassador from different local enterprises and ecosystem players around APAC region.\n\n![Screenshot 2024-06-22 at 12.16.29 AM.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmecQ1QadJcrTWE1KnaN9QqBBzzTLbjkumqN4FkHFJfNWk)\n\nI have been building both Polkadot & Parachain Community ecosystem globally for 4+ years, and serving the ecosystem as the Head Ambassador of East Asia for 3 years. I worked for Parity for 1 year as Ecosystem Community Builder at EcoDev department, focusing on supporting parachain teams and helping them to collaborate with each other (for instance, via the Polkadot Forum as a Forum Admin). I am based in South Korea (which is one of the [biggest crypto-market with global reach & notably high trading volumes](https://reports.tiger-research.com/p/korean-crypto-market-eng)), and supported Astar Network as the Head of EcoDev & Korea Growth Lead, focused on developing and onboarding projects from the ecosystem-wise and from the Korean market at the same time. I have always been representing Polkadot and Astar and given keynote speeches at various conferences and meetups with Gavin Wood, also hosted the [first-ever hackathon in Korea](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KT2EaGNAhdKvD1dv7AtlYFkN3wcvN7oSsshPROptvf8/edit) through ex-Event Bounty along with Raf. \n\n**- Then who is Raf? -**\nRaf is a Polkadot Ambassador since 2022 based in South Korea, works as a Substrate engineer at Blockchain Labs, an entity that has been actively using Substrate as the main tech-stack to build cool products. Raf is also the 2nd PBA alumni from Polkadot Blockchain Academy Buenos Aires Edition to learn blockchain and Substrate and contribute to Polkadot ecosystem. Raf, as a DevRel (under my guidance), coordinated and executed all the developer side of the Polkadot promotional program(a hackathon, called HackaDOT2023, [proofs](https://photos.app.goo.gl/xL5utar9gdAGSStA6)) before [Buidl Asia](https://www.buidl.asia/) week of 2023 as an essential part of the Substrate promotion and adoption initiatives in Korea, Japan and other countries from Asia(including SEA), to promote Substrate as an open-source framework for local developers and convert the Rust learners among local dev-community to Substrate builders and to promote Polkadot Blockchain Academy. \n\n![telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5833291081414980261-x.jpg](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYFW6vnNwfnAYGr8Uj6ZKDwpJiw1HJC3Vd58C3m4mud3S)\n\nSubStake Team we both have broad connections with key players in the East Asia market, considering my EcoDev position at both Parity and Astar, we had to work closely with numerous stakeholders across Web2 to Web3 space.\n\n**- Current activity -**\nRecently supported [Gavin's JAM Tour at Seoul National University](https://lu.ma/1x6q3bo5) with a first-ever [Interview Article of Gav from South Korea](https://biz.chosun.com/stock/finance/2024/06/17/URTGGLVLF5APZKV7RPPXMEBPXI/). I am working on onboarding large entities to the Polkadot ecosystem such as traditional media press, validator groups and enterprise companies, and once onboarded as HA will focus on Developer Community as well with Raf as a DevRel. We are not only actively participating in Polkadot BD meetings/events, but also been actively hosting those Polkadot-centric events so that we can deliver actual value/message to those who want to enter the ecosystem.\n\n![KakaoTalk_Photo_2024-06-22-00-26-02-min.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYSTRTrhGnxudr8Y4HjKjbTbMS8HV76nb5gt7Fo1UfVSM)\n\nYou will be finding us speaking at upcoming events such as Decoded satellite event, HackaDOT, KBW2024, HackSeoul, WebX and others.\n\nWe are taking responsibility of those we brought to the ecosystem, including Senior Ambassadors, Ambassadors and others being part of Eastern Asia region and Polkadot Korea, collaborating with SubWallet, OpenGuild, Polkadot HK, ex-Parity APAC members, W3F core-members.\n\nWe would like to engage more actively back into participating on OpenGov and Polkadot Forum as a Head Ambassador of East Asia, we are usually contributing to the ecosystem through various event-basis. (We normally act/execute more than we speak/write.)\n\n**- Why vote Aye for Team SubStake!? -**\nAs of 2022, South Korea and Japan had a huge crypto market with around 14 million crypto users, equivalent to approximately 22% of the population of South Korea and Japan. Additionally, these markets are significant players in the global cryptocurrency industry, with high levels of crypto adoption in Korea and a growing interest in Japan. East Asia, specifically Korea and Japan, has a total of 1.3 million developers with 81,000 newly graduated developers annually, and over 800 blockchain companies established as of 2021. \n\n![Screenshot 2024-06-22 at 12.30.04 AM.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdGC4nBUmHFVeA3HDqq7R2GKtoXPHw7Rr8VUH151vAeNQ)\n\nDespite its rapid growth and huge expansion potential, the Polkadot ecosystem's presence in East Asia STILL remains limited in comparison to other blockchains such as Ethereum and its L2 chains (Optimism, zkSync, zkEVM), with Polkadot struggling to attract both end-users and builders.\n\nThere is therefore an urgent need for marketing and DevRel campaigns around Polkadot, as well as growth and BD efforts in East Asia. Hence, here we come - Team SubStake. \n\nFor more achievements as before and if you need Kimchi-power at Polkadot, vote - \"Aye!\".",

Image below shows how Mexico and Brazil have been the countries with the greatest [economy growth in America](https://www.proyectosmexico.gob.mx/en/why_mexican_infrastructure/solid-and-open-economy/economic-growth/).\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPS77Bhvi681NbHU7qjes3Vj89W6GbQMduHQKrMqe9s2J)\n\nBeing a Head Ambassador will allow to the Mexican Collective to lead the adoption of Polkadot across the country and mainly to have the authority to represent Polkadot and in a near future present a Business Development proposal tailored to Mexico needs, thus, we will be able to onboard devs and users and at the same time incorporate companies to Polkadot.\n\nTo accomplish the above we are open to collaborate with other collectives such as the Brazilian team, thereby we can take advantage of different strengths and expertise, giving Polkadot a greater chance to succeed on its mission.\n\n**Work agenda summary**\n\n- Represent Polkadot at events throughout Mexico.\n- Link Polkadot to the Mexican government.\n- Onboard new users and devs to Polkadot.\n- Establish links between Polkadot and the business sector within Mexico.\n- Present a business development bounty proposal tailored to Mexico needs.\n- Collaborate with other teams within Polkadot to share business development skills and expertise to drive Polkadot forward.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nThe salary will be used as compensation for the time and effort contributed by the 7 members of the collective and to pay for operational costs like traveling to events to represent Polkadot.\n\n**Collective members background:**\n\n●\tArmando, I hold a law degree. I've been part of the Polkadot ecosystem since 2020, and I was thrilled when I participated in the parachains on both Kusama and Polkadot. In 2022, I applied to become a Polkadot ambassador, and since then, I haven’t stopped participating with the Polkadot Mexico community in organizing events, workshops, presentations, and conferences, all with the goal of continuing to educate the Mexican community. At the moment, I am the Head Ambassador at Polimec and the Community Manager of Tododecripto, the number one community in Mexico for education in Web3, memes, etc. I’m eagerly awaiting the release of Polkadot 2.0 and everything it will bring us in the future with the new implementations.\n[Contributions made for the ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18G7b24QMkFaBE1hir5BQTsLRGfAekAygSLxCnfwyvwI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n●\tCesar holds a bachelor’s degree in administration with specialization in finance, he has been in the crypto ecosystem since the beginning of 2020 and that same year he got to know the Polkadot ecosystem, but it wasn’t until 2021 that he began contributing as an ambassador for some other projects in the ecosystem (Moonbeam and SubQuery). As he became more active in the ecosystem, he started to become more interested in the workings of Polkadot itself. That is why, in 2022, he and a group of friends who are also Polkadot ambassadors officially created the Polkadot community in Mexico, organizing events for the Polkadot community in Mexico.

Its token split movement caught my attention, and I wanted to get more involved. Not knowing many people in Mexico, I decided to seek community, and that’s when I found some very pleasant individuals who had formed the Polkadot Mexico group. I was invited to join the Polkadot Ambassador program and the Polkadot Mexico group. Since then, I’ve been involved with my colleagues in various meetups to raise awareness about the ecosystem and its various parachains and updates. We’ve always been attentive to people who have doubts about Polkadot technology. Additionally, the Polkadot Mexico YouTube channel was created to upload videos on various topics about Polkadot and practical cases so that people could understand actions to be taken more clearly. It’s been an incredible process, and we’re aiming for the Mexican community to be a reference both within and outside the country for teaching about the Polkadot ecosystem.\n[Contributions Made for the Ecosystem](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tuW1VMXECt6V4STn2RbK5fl4ME1WC6KqNYnKjw7NaUM/edit)\n\nThank you very much for your support!\n\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYu8ZcYh5vxJycHihNUDGY79K325fbA989LGPA3ss8H6E)",

      "content": "![FINAL.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVA9M4gFmFzKF4xpFipHLUzeVPbPSuofiEs6khg9n9VQA)\n\n\n**Greetings Polkadot!**\n\nMy name is Angelina, I’m based in Dubai, UAE where I’ve had the great opportunity to represent Polkadot & Kusama within the Crypto community. I joined the Polkadot ecosystem in 2022 and since then, I've dedicated myself to driving growth and engagement within Dubai’s vibrant crypto community. My contributions have focused on event management, community building, and representing Polkadot at various high-profile crypto events in Dubai.\n\n**Background and Expertise**\n\nAs the regional Ambassador for Polkadot in the Middle East, I leveraged my experience in growth marketing, project management, and social media to grow the community and increase awareness in the Middle East. By connecting with other Web3 communities, fostering educational initiatives, and hosting events including mini-hackathons, I’ve been an enthusiastic ambassador sharing my passion for Web3 innovations. \n\n**Current Activity**\n\nCurrently, I’ve been focused on expanding Polkadot's presence in the UAE and the broader MENA region. Here are some of my key activities:\n\n- **Event Management**: I have successfully organised and hosted numerous Polkadot events in Dubai, starting with the [first event in 2022](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/polkadot-and-kusama-dubai/events/289622171/). These events have ranged from ‘Polkadot - Dubai Ecosystem Meetup’ to ‘Dubai Polkadot Fireside Chat - Working in Web3’ on X spaces (link [here](https://x.com/PolkadotDubai/status/1631506102339739648)) and [a Mini-hackathon](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/polkadot-and-kusama-dubai/events/296926925/) to name a few.\n- **Community Building**: I’ve supported ambassadors from other regions in planning events, and set the agenda that is tailored to the audience in Dubai. With 328 members signing up to our meetup page attendance for real life (IRL) has grown significantly over the past few years. I’ve created and designed marketing materials myself and posted these on our Dubai Telegram group. Telegram has been a great channel for the community to stay up to date on future events. As the admin & moderator of this group, I’ve been continuously updating and communicating with the community.\n- **Representation at Crypto Events**: I have represented Polkadot at various high-profile crypto events in Dubai, including Dubai Blockchain Week, World Blockchain Summit, and Future Blockchain Summit. I’ve attended Women in Crypto events sponsored by Binance event where I spoke to leading women about the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem. See [link](https://x.com/binance/status/1618187247328673792) to that specific event.\n- **Involvement in Other Ecosystems**: I've helped grow the Polimec community as a regional ambassador for Dubai, UAE. As an attendee, I have met with other leading chains with a huge presence in Dubai (e.g. Cosmos/ATOM Dubai and Solana etc). These social events have allowed me to increase my network of venues and seek more growth opportunities (e.g. co-hosting and future collaboration).\n\n**Future Plans and Vision**\n\nAs the Head Ambassador, I would like to:\n\n- **Increase Community Engagement**: Organize more frequent events with financial support, ensuring consistent engagement and growth of the Polkadot community. These events will include workshops, hackathons, and collaborative sessions designed to educate and inspire community members. I’d also be keen to present Polkadot at major conferences in Dubai.\n- **Strengthen Partnerships**: Build stronger relationships with local and international blockchain organizations, and enterprises to boost awareness and engagement with the Polkadot ecosystem. More specifically:\n- **Governments**: We’ve already signed an MOU with the [Dubai Blockchain Association](https://blockchaincenter.ae/event/polkadot-dubai-hackathon-event/) - this was a great milestone, but the partnership has been put on hold due to financial commitment from Polkadot. Future events will be advertised on a larger scale, so catering to these people needs to be well-planned and executed. This requires time and resources. Additionally, we have ambassador candidates across the Middle East and in the capital city Abu Dhabi. Dubai government hosts events about the future of technology e.g. Dubai AI & [Web3 Festival.](https://dubaiaiweb3festival.com/), where given the opportunity I'd present about Polkadot as interoperability and the decentralised web is a big topic on the agenda. \n- **Other Ecosystems**: Enabling cross-chain collaboration and mutual growth, promoting interoperability and shared learning is a priority. (e.g., Cosmoverse, Superteam UAE, ETHDubai, etc.)\n- **Software Engineering Groups**: As part of my network, I’ve spoken to local engineering communities who have not explored Web3 or attended the mini-hackathon we ran due to the timing. I’d like to increase awareness and access to a local talent pool by hosting engaging events and workshops in collaboration with engineering groups ([Dubai Software Engineering Managers](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/dubai-software-engineering-management-group/)).\n- **Educational and Advocacy Initiatives**: I will launch comprehensive educational programs and resources to empower our community, advocate for decentralization at major crypto events, and leverage my Web3 gaming experience to create innovative opportunities within the Polkadot ecosystem. My efforts will ensure that Polkadot remains at the forefront of blockchain technology and community growth.\n\n**Why vote Aye!?**\n\nBy voting \"Aye,\" you're supporting a leader who has significantly boosted the Polkadot community's growth across the UAE, represented the network at numerous high-profile events, and is committed to expanding our reach even further. Based full-time in Dubai, I will also support other local ambassadors who have helped run events, co-hosting with the Budapest, India, and Arts DAO communities to continue the great foundations we’ve achieved.\n\nOther reasons to vote AYE:\n\n- Grew the Polkadot community by +50% across the UAE.\n- Represented Polkadot at over 25 key events in the UAE and the Middle East.\n- Organized and hosted 10+ successful Polkadot meetups and hackathons.\n- Formed strategic partnerships with major blockchain organizations.\n- Managed community social channels (i.e., Telegram, Twitter - [PolkadotDubai](https://x.com/PolkadotDubai), and Discord [Middle East](https://discord.com/channels/722223075629727774/759078683012628512)).\n\n\"Together we can achieve more.\"\n\nThank you for your support!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Application: Mario Altenburger",
      "content": "Dear Polkadot community,\n\nMy name is Mario Altenburger and I am applying to represent Polkadot as a Head Ambassador, primarily as a **business development accelerator** and **fundraiser** for the ecosystem.\n\nHaving worked in the Polkadot ecosystem for nearly 3 years now, I have had the opportunity to meet many of you in person and I have to say the professionalism and commitment of the teams building on and/or for Polkadot is far beyond what I have seen in any other ecosystem. \n\nPolkadot is the reason why I decided to move from traditional finance into crypto. While the technology and builders are far ahead of others, I believe we still lack widespread adoption. \n\nIt will take joint efforts from various angles to help convince projects to build on Polkadot and importantly also to migrate to our ecosystem. Below I will share more on my background and how I plan to drive to push for adoption. \n\nIn addition, I would represent Polkadot at traditional investment conferences to help raise new funds for the ecosystem, by finding direct investments for projects, large new DOT buyers as well as investors into fund dedicated to deploy in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n\n**Background**\n\nBorn and raised in Austria, I worked most of my career in the finance sector in Hong Kong. After completing a MA in Economics in Innsbruck and a MA in Mathematics of Finance at Columbia University, I spent 14 years at Bank of China International in Hong Kong.\n\nAs Head of EMEA Origination and Debt Syndicate, I focused on **fundraising** for Chinese and international corporates, raising a total of USD500 billion of debt, equity-linked and structured financings in over 1,000 transactions. I spearheaded the bank's **international expansion** leading landmark transactions such as the first German Renminbi bond from Volkswagen, the first high yield bond from Korea by Korean Air, the first Chinese Euro bond by CNOOC, the first global sukuk offering from Saudi Aramco and the largest convertible bond from Hong Kong by Cathay Pacific.\n \nI worked with hundreds of **major multinational corporations** (MNCs, mostly Fortune 500), **governments** as well as **institutional investors** and **family offices**, and have developed a **close working relationship at senior level**.\n\n\n**Harbour Industrial Capital**\n\nIn 2021, Max Rebol and I co-founded Harbour Industrial Capital (HIC). We are registered in the Cayman Islands and headquartered in HK. As of Q1 2024 our fund has an AUM of over US$10 million. We have raised this capital from private investors such as Family Offices, and subsequently invested it in over 20 Polkadot-based projects. The primary method of deploying capital were parachain auctions, as part of which we locked up DOT in exchange for a fixed amount of parachain tokens. More recently we have also made direct investment in Polkadot-based projects. Fund 1 held its final closing on 31 December 2023, and we are planning to raise a second fund later this year.\n\nI was speaker at various conferences, instructor of a course on Parachain Auction at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy, Panel Moderator at Polkadot Day in HK; Judge of the HK Web3Hack; Winner of the TADS Award for Ecosystem Excellence in DeFi.\n\nOverall, in the past 3 years, we have been constantly on the road educating folks about Polkadot and convincing that Polkadot is the preferred destination for their capital, applications or projects.\n\n\n**Connecting the DOTs for Polkadot**\n\nMy plan is to fully leverage on my **network** built throughout my career to (continue to) approach these MNCs and governments to convince them to utilize Polkadot technology for both existing processes and to upgrade their systems to the latest cutting-edge technology.\n\nImagine a major car manufacturer moving the supply and production lines onto Polkadot or one of its parachains. Airline ticketing, fuel consumption tracking and carbon credits offsetting all done in the same application.\n\nWe have been working actively already on **bringing major projects to Polkadot** and we may have some good news for the community in the coming weeks. These are projects with the potential to migrate millions of wallets and transactions to Polkadot.\n\nIn addition, Max and I are preparing our second fund, a **Polkadot Ecosystem fund**. We will be at numerous **traditional investment conferences** and **family office summits** promoting Polkadot. We plan to **invite project teams** to join us for conferences and/or the side events and investor dinners that we will organize.\n\nTo highlight again here also that for any treasury proposals that we submit to fund sponsorship for Polkadot at conferences we would NOT include any salary for ourselves.\n\nAs a Head Ambassador of Polkadot, it would certainly make my efforts easier with an official endorsement from the community.\n\nI would look forward to working closely with the 20 other Head Ambassadors, many of whom I have worked with already. It is important to have a diverse set of Head Ambassadors covering various angles of the community, both inwards and outwards.\n\nMore importantly I am very much excited to engage even closer with the overall community, builders and projects so that we can together unleash Polkadot’s full potential. Thanks for your time and support!\n\nFor reference:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8ATl5WWcPs\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xN-HeJoGI4\n\n",

This initiative aims to enhance technical and non technical education and integration of new projects into the ecosystem. Additionally, it serves as a bridge to the decentralized resources available within the ecosystem.\n\n**Context**\n\nThe Polkadot Ambassador Program was an initiative of Web3 Foundation that concluded in January 2024. Now the program was restructured and approved through an on-chain community vote. \n\nThe Polkadot community has decided to maintain the ambassador program, with global representatives responsible for advancing the development, promotion, education, and communication of the ecosystem. This transition underscores the community's recognition of the vital role these ambassadors and teams play in the ecosystem's growth and evolution.\nIt is now the responsibility of the Head Ambassadors to assemble a team with different profiles that work together and collaborate with the global community to implement a strategic plan that further advances the Polkadot ecosystem and its technology.\n\n**Problem and challenges to be addressed**\n\n**Network changes:** Polkadot is undergoing a profound transformation, highlighting the crucial need for comprehensive technical and non-technical communication, education and training to foster the expansion of the ecosystem.\n**Brand Recognition Deficit**: The Polkadot brand currently suffers from a notable lack of visibility, hindering its ability to attract attention and maintain the network effect within the industry.\n**Integration Complexities**: The process for projects to join the Polkadot ecosystem is marred by complexities, several projects face challenges in effectively joining the Polkadot ecosystem, resulting in missed opportunities for ecosystem integration and growth. \n\n**Plan and value proposition**\n\nIn order to address the problem, we propose to work on verticals with development objectives defined below: \n\n**2 Verticals**\n\n**Ecosystem Integration and Business Development\nEducation**\n\nQuotes from Gavin Wood at ETH Prague:\n\n\"The relevance of this technology comes from resilience. In the developing world, systems such as the social structure are not resilient, they are corrupt. That's where Polkadot's technology becomes relevant.\"\n\n“This is a technical and financial product that is trying to be marketed to people who have neither the need nor the necessary background”.\n\nThe industry should continue to enhance tech, reduce user barriers, and find more long-tail use cases.\nImplementation\n\nThe team will implement these verticals through a quarterly plan, collaborating with selected community members. Tasks will be assigned based on expertise and networks, ensuring efficient execution.\nFunding will be requested through on-chain referenda to ensure community approval and access treasury funds.\nA detailed agenda outlining the four-month plan for each defined vertical will be presented to the community.\n\n**Team**\n\nLorena, also known as blockya. Polkadot Head Ambassador since 2021 for Latin America. Speaker. Polkadot Hub Co-founder. Polkadot hackathon in Latin America in 2022. Spanish Bounty Curator. DV Cohort 2 for Kusama.\n \nErnih. Polkadot Senior Ambassador since 2021. Speaker. Polkadot Hub Co-Founder. Polkadot hackathon in Latin America in 2022. Spanish Bounty Curator. \n\nLengo, developer. Spanish Bounty Curator. Polkadot Ambassador. Web3 Builder Founder. Polkadot Hub member. \n\nNachito, Dotcast Co-Founder. Spanish Bounty Curator. Polkadot Ambassador - Ecosystem Agent. \n\nRoco, Dotcast Co-Founder, Polkadot Ambassador - Polimec Ambassador - Ecosystem Agent. \n—-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI will post the full proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z0qC8Ers76AzWXf88jTO7kPG1LcU9ZfP5V0swv_gQhk/edit?usp=sharing\n\n",

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Application: William",
      "content": "**Introduction**\n\nHello! My name is William, and I’m applying to be a Head Ambassador (HA) for Polkadot. I would like to serve the ecosystem and work to drive forward a vibrant, effective and inclusive ambassador program. \n\n**TLDR**\n\n- Six, one of the newly elected HAs has endorsed my candidacy: “I find him a good candidate for his extremly good communication skills and understanding of the technology. He can be trusted with tasks to deliver. I hope the current voting turns: Good luck!”\n- Saxemberg has endorsed my candidacy, based on the plan presented and the BD/regional needs it fulfills\n- Max and Mario of the HIC Polkadot investment fund have endorsed my candidacy - “He is one of few people who has both deep technical knowledge, as well as great communications and presentation skills, as illustrated by him winning the HK PBA startup pitch competition... I think of the ambassadorship primarily as a representative role vis-a-vie third parties, or as being the \"face of Polkadot\". I can think of few people who are better suited for this than William.”\n\nWhy choose me?\n\n- Polkadot is a very technical subject, and this makes it very hard to stay up to date with the latest changes as well as communicate them to outsiders. I have both a computer science degree and an MBA from leading institutions, and this gives me the ability to talk to people from both worlds.\n- I can bridge many worlds in Polkadot: a) West to East, as I’m from North America but have been living in APAC/Taiwan for 7 years and interested to build up OpenGov participation in this region, b) today vs the future, BD needs help as much help as possible selling Polkadot as is today while we also need to push forward the plaza and JAM fronts, and c) Tech and business, to distill Polkadot into something that can be communicated outwards successfully to both developers and users.\n- I have been on the front lines of Polkadot usage while at Talisman over the past two years, both the, retail and enterprise users. Polkadot is very complicated to explain and understand, and we need to empathize with the challenges users face to tackle this.\n- I have been to the PBA, an intense education into Polkadot. I believe this compresses a lot of Polkadot knowledge into a short time, with instructors from W3F, Parity and ecosystem teams, and has given me a lot of connections across the ecosystem.\n- I have plenty of experience with OpenGov, including being a DV and evaluating hundreds of proposals, but also authoring >$1.7M worth of granted proposals as part of my previous role. OpenGov (and the treasury) is a great differentiator and asset to our ecosystem that can support new entrants that will accrue a lot of value to DOT.\n\nThe ambassador program: what is it and what will I focus on?\n\n- It’s the front lines of bringing Polkadot out into the world. It should be about putting our best foot forward and inviting people in, as well as ensuring they find what they need, onboard smoothly and get to the “magic moment” of why Polkadot is different. This requires communication and understanding of how to have a different message for each of the following groups: retail adopters, enterprise adopters and tech visionary adopters.\n- I will onboard enterprise adopters and establish partnerships by creating ROI-based storytelling based on the successes Polkadot has already achieved. I will work to unify efforts and messaging between BD and ambassadors, and train up an organization of ambassadors to do the same.\n- I will build up the Polkadot presence in APAC/East Asia, and help teams understand the treasury and OpenGov so they can get up and running more easily. This region has a lot to contribute and is left out of the conversation too often.\n\n**Context**\n\nI’d like to start by describing how I view the larger context from which we operate. I believe we are at the crossroads of a few transitions for Polkadot:\n\n- the transition from 1.0 to the future, \n- the decentralization and its aftereffects, \n- and the first chapter of how we want to govern Polkadot as a DAO\n\nWe need to navigate all of these successfully for the network to flourish, but should acknowledge they inject uncertainty for participants, contributors, builders and end users. I believe the role of ambassadors is to communicate bi-directionally for the organization while bringing forth a strong case to choose Polkadot, and the role of Head Ambassadors is to lead by example and create a resilient and effective organization for ambassadors.\n\nThe foundation we establish now, not just on technical matters, but on the organizational, outreach and cultural aspects of Polkadot will lay the groundwork for network success over the next decade. While I have not been a Polkadot ambassador before, I believe that I can offer an outside perspective, seek out and listen to stakeholders, and be committed to building up the ambassador collective as a key part of the next evolution of Polkadot.\n\n**Polkadot Experience**\n\nI bring into this role the culmination of a number of different experiences in Polkadot. I started as a member of Talisman from May 2022 to May 2024, which gave me the perspective of being an ecosystem team dealing directly with end users and enterprises trying to use Polkadot. I was able to become familiar with working with many of the funding opportunities available in Polkadot, including the Polkadot treasury, the W3F grants program and the DF program, as well as the stress for teams  inherent in the application process.\n\nHowever, I feel my proper introduction to the ecosystem happened at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy HK 2024, where I got to know over 100 builders as well as instructors from W3F, Parity, the Fellowship and the ecosystem. I was able to learn about the design and operation of Polkadot on a deeper level, and this inspired me to volunteer my candidacy to be a Decentralized Voice for the first cohort, to help steward governance. I believe that I served with integrity and care in the position. Following is a summary of my recent experience:\n\n- Selected as [Decentralized Voices Cohort 1](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-round-1-candidates-announced-23d9a800b260), and via that monitored and evaluated hundreds of proposals. (See my [original application](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/decentralized-voices-program-william/6099))\n- Attended Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA) HK 2024 and graduated with distinction, winning the pitch competition\n- Authored, applied for and awarded (as part of a company) a [DF Grant](https://medium.com/@web3/decentralized-futures-introducing-polkadot-multisig-powered-by-signet-2b7cbcbf1cec) for Signet\n- Authored, applied for and awarded (as part of a company) a [W3F Grant](https://grants.web3.foundation/applications/signet) for Signet and “Sign-in With Substrate” (SIWS)\n- Authored, submitted and was granted (as part of a company) 5 Polkadot Treasury Proposals totaling $1.7M ([1](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/148), [2](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/342), [3](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/388), [4](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/547), [5](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/714))\n- Set up and managed on-chain multisig and proxy/AA structures for organizations in both Polkadot and Ethereum.\n- Interviewed by Irina for the “Business Case for Polkadot” [podcast](https://x.com/DOT4Business/status/1783473679311208814)\n- Gave insights on the decentralization initiative in the [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/02/05/polkadots-path-to-decentralization-latest-insights/)\n- Have attended numerous Polkadot events: Token 2049 SG (Polkadot Booth; 2023), PBA Hong Kong (Jan 2024), Sub0 Bangkok (March 2024), TeamZ Tokyo (Polkadot Booth; March 2024), EthTaipei (Polkadot Booth; March 2024), JAM Lecture SG/PBA Ceremony (planned; June 2024), Decoded Brussels (planned; July 2024).\n- Multisig signer to steward various OpenGov spends for the community: Mythical x DOT, InterMiami\n\nI am currently in the planning phase of an initiative in Polkadot to create a web portal that uses ROI-based storytelling to engage and convert enterprise adopters for Polkadot. I hope this will be funded by the ecosystem, as I believe we have so far to go in terms of promoting the awareness and value proposition of Polkadot to enterprise adopters in a way that resonates with them. I believe this ties in well to the role of Head Ambassador, and will describe it more in the next section.\n\n**Role**\n\nI will approach the role of the Head Ambassador with three areas of focus: 1- Bridging Polkadot to the outside world, 2- Bringing the voices of internal stakeholders to the surface, and 3- Creating a robust organization to set up the collective for success.\n\n1- Bridging Polkadot to the outside world: \n\nI believe the primary role of ambassadors is to shine a light on the ecosystem’s successes and build bridges to partners and potential adopters to enhance the ecosystem. I believe the noise and attention we generate today is too much within our own echo chamber as well as too hidden behind the Polkadot learning curve, and I believe that if we focus on ROI-based storytelling we can make Polkadot’s platform resonate much better with enterprise adopters.\n\nI recently did a survey of all the enterprise success stories I could find, and surprisingly there were a lot! As you can see in the image below, Polkadot ALREADY has a lot of enterprise success stories and I will work to collect, create and disseminate these stories so they spread both within and outside of the ecosystem, working hand in hand with both BD teams and ambassador teams. \n\n ![Enterprise successes.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPFsg8MCB1rkUJEMeGXEdHDWeTeTsfEwCQhGAidzGoJAp)\n\nBeyond these successes, it’s important to communicate all of the resources and support that Polkadot provides for onboarding, and funnel external parties to ecosystem support services, including but not limited to the Technical Support bounty, the BD teams around the ecosystem, the deployment infra like Tanssi/Magnet/Pop and the system integrators like BlockDeep and R0gue. And of course there are the different bounties and treasury that can help to fund integrations. These are incredible benefits that enable adoption of Polkadot, but it’s not clear enough to outsiders that they are available. I will work towards spreading the message about the support Polkadot can provide to adopters.\n\nGiven the decentralized nature of our global organization, BD teams are naturally siloed, and we can improve the “glue” that connects representative groups together. I will endeavor to help to align efforts among the different groups so that we can more easily bring wins from one group or geographic area to others.\n\nAs an HA, I will also offer 1:1 support and onboarding help for interested enterprises, to understand their needs at a first pass and connect them to the right ecosystem resources to advance to the next stage in their Polkadot journey, as well as enable other ambassadors on the team to do the same. I believe customer relationship management is very important in the pre-sales process for onboarding larger enterprises. As someone who is very familiar with the ecosystem funding opportunities (e.g. DF, W3F, Treasury, bounties/prizes) as well as the BD teams, I believe I can help newcomers in choosing the best path to enter the ecosystem. Furthermore, I will work on building and enabling champions within enterprises to spread Polkadot.\n\n2- Bringing the voice of internal stakeholders to the surface:\n\nOne key realization that hit me when I first started my DV role was how many constituencies within the ecosystem did not want to make their voices heard in governance. This happened for various reasons, including not wanting to oppose a powerful force that may retaliate, being restricted based on where they work, not having time to understand proposals in detail, not wanting to vote against friends/allies in a non-anonymized way, cultural or language barriers, personality, or not wanting to get into the politics of the situation. One aspect of what I took on in my role of DV was to seek out these voices, hear their perspective, and represent the unspoken so that their views and concerns could be heard. I believe this is still very important to enable a healthy ecosystem, and I will continue this as HA.\n\nAnother internal aspect that I feel is very important after my DV experience is bridging East and West, especially the Chinese community. Polkadot, by heritage, is largely European/Western, but Polkadot as a blockchain ecosystem is global, and should inspire and support builders from all over the world. Frequently it comes down to language/cultural barriers which just require patience and understanding to surmount. As my background is from the US and I now live in East Asia, I believe I can help to promote this region, bring new leaders in the fold and encourage voices that have not spoken as loudly yet are just as motivated to contribute. \n\n3- Creating a robust organization to set up the collective for success:\n\nFinally, I believe the role of HA is not just about public relations, BD or communication, but it requires standing up the organization of ambassadors and ensuring it can support what they need to be successful. This involves mentorship, leadership and organizational skills. I am fully committed to work with the other Head Ambassadors and rise to the challenge of setting up an efficient and effective organization. \n\nI will proactively seek out feedback from existing and past ambassadors, the community, token holders and other stakeholders in order to bring the organization forward. This will necessarily be a team effort that involves multiple stakeholders, and I see the Head Ambassadors as the responsible party for actioning the education, training, planning, satisfaction and effectiveness of the collective.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nI believe the HA funding should go towards Head Ambassador duties, which include representing Polkadot, engaging external parties such as potential adopters or investors, familiarizing oneself with the ecosystem and ecosystem participants, education and building up the collective from an operational point of view. If I receive funding from Polkadot to bring forth any initiatives I am working on, it will be segmented from HA duties.\n\n**Personal Background**\n\nI have a strong technical foundation, with a Computer Science degree from a leading institution, and I started my career as an engineer and then product manager. I later moved into the business side, e.g. sales and operations, and earned an MBA, which I feel provided a great foundation in the non-technical areas of management, communications and organizational design. I believe I can effectively bridge the worlds of tech and business and this is important both within the ecosystem and externally with potential partners and enterprise adopters.\n\nBeyond just qualifications, I think success in this role really comes down to being able to focus on and care about the people in and around Polkadot, including the builders creating the ecosystem, the teams coming in to adopt, the potential investors, the token holders, the ambassadors and the myriad other stakeholders who make up the ecosystem. I hope to have your support in this endeavor, and please reach out with any questions.\n\nWilliam\n[@replghost](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/user/replghost) on TG",

          "content": "**Introduction**\n\nHello! My name is William, and I’m applying to be a Head Ambassador (HA) for Polkadot. I would like to serve the ecosystem and work to drive forward a vibrant, effective and inclusive ambassador program. \n\n**TLDR**\n\n- Six, one of the newly elected HAs has endorsed my candidacy: “I find him a good candidate for his extremly good communication skills and understanding of the technology. He can be trusted with tasks to deliver. I hope the current voting turns: Good luck!”\n- Saxemberg has endorsed my candidacy, based on the plan presented and the BD/regional needs it fulfills\n- Max and Mario of the HIC Polkadot investment fund have endorsed my candidacy - “He is one of few people who has both deep technical knowledge, as well as great communications and presentation skills, as illustrated by him winning the HK PBA startup pitch competition... I think of the ambassadorship primarily as a representative role vis-a-vie third parties, or as being the \"face of Polkadot\". I can think of few people who are better suited for this than William.”\n\nWhy choose me?\n\n- Polkadot is a very technical subject, and this makes it very hard to stay up to date with the latest changes as well as communicate them to outsiders. I have both a computer science degree and an MBA from leading institutions, and this gives me the ability to talk to people from both worlds.\n- I can bridge many worlds in Polkadot: a) West to East, as I’m from North America but have been living in APAC/Taiwan for 7 years and interested to build up OpenGov participation in this region, b) today vs the future, BD needs help as much help as possible selling Polkadot as is today while we also need to push forward the plaza and JAM fronts, and c) Tech and business, to distill Polkadot into something that can be communicated outwards successfully to both developers and users.\n- I have been on the front lines of Polkadot usage while at Talisman over the past two years, both the, retail and enterprise users. Polkadot is very complicated to explain and understand, and we need to empathize with the challenges users face to tackle this.\n- I have been to the PBA, an intense education into Polkadot. I believe this compresses a lot of Polkadot knowledge into a short time, with instructors from W3F, Parity and ecosystem teams, and has given me a lot of connections across the ecosystem.\n- I have plenty of experience with OpenGov, including being a DV and evaluating hundreds of proposals, but also authoring >$1.7M worth of granted proposals as part of my previous role. OpenGov (and the treasury) is a great differentiator and asset to our ecosystem that can support new entrants that will accrue a lot of value to DOT.\n\nThe ambassador program: what is it and what will I focus on?\n\n- It’s the front lines of bringing Polkadot out into the world. It should be about putting our best foot forward and inviting people in, as well as ensuring they find what they need, onboard smoothly and get to the “magic moment” of why Polkadot is different. This requires communication and understanding of how to have a different message for each of the following groups: retail adopters, enterprise adopters and tech visionary adopters.\n- I will work to onboard enterprise adopters and establish partnerships by creating ROI-based storytelling based on the successes Polkadot has already achieved. I will work to unify efforts and messaging between BD and ambassadors, and train up an organization of ambassadors to do the same.\n- I will build up the Polkadot presence in APAC/East Asia, and help teams understand the treasury and OpenGov so they can get up and running more easily. This region has a lot to contribute and is left out of the conversation too often.\n\n**Context**\n\nI’d like to start by describing how I view the larger context from which we operate. I believe we are at the crossroads of a few transitions for Polkadot:\n\n- the transition from 1.0 to the future, \n- the decentralization and its aftereffects, \n- and the first chapter of how we want to govern Polkadot as a DAO\n\nWe need to navigate all of these successfully for the network to flourish, but should acknowledge they inject uncertainty for participants, contributors, builders and end users. I believe the role of ambassadors is to communicate bi-directionally for the organization while bringing forth a strong case to choose Polkadot, and the role of Head Ambassadors is to lead by example and create a resilient and effective organization for ambassadors.\n\nThe foundation we establish now, not just on technical matters, but on the organizational, outreach and cultural aspects of Polkadot will lay the groundwork for network success over the next decade. While I have not been a Polkadot ambassador before, I believe that I can offer an outside perspective, seek out and listen to stakeholders, and be committed to building up the ambassador collective as a key part of the next evolution of Polkadot.\n\n**Polkadot Experience**\n\nI bring into this role the culmination of a number of different experiences in Polkadot. I started as a member of Talisman from May 2022 to May 2024, which gave me the perspective of being an ecosystem team dealing directly with end users and enterprises trying to use Polkadot. I was able to become familiar with working with many of the funding opportunities available in Polkadot, including the Polkadot treasury, the W3F grants program and the DF program, as well as the stress for teams  inherent in the application process.\n\nHowever, I feel my proper introduction to the ecosystem happened at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy HK 2024, where I got to know over 100 builders as well as instructors from W3F, Parity, the Fellowship and the ecosystem. I was able to learn about the design and operation of Polkadot on a deeper level, and this inspired me to volunteer my candidacy to be a Decentralized Voice for the first cohort, to help steward governance. I believe that I served with integrity and care in the position. Following is a summary of my recent experience:\n\n- Selected as [Decentralized Voices Cohort 1](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-round-1-candidates-announced-23d9a800b260), and via that monitored and evaluated hundreds of proposals.

I hope this will be funded by the ecosystem, as I believe we have so far to go in terms of promoting the awareness and value proposition of Polkadot to enterprise adopters in a way that resonates with them. I believe this ties in well to the role of Head Ambassador, and will describe it more in the next section.\n\n**Role**\n\nI will approach the role of the Head Ambassador with three areas of focus: 1- Bridging Polkadot to the outside world, 2- Bringing the voices of internal stakeholders to the surface, and 3- Creating a robust organization to set up the collective for success.\n\n1- Bridging Polkadot to the outside world: \n\nI believe the primary role of ambassadors is to shine a light on the ecosystem’s successes and build bridges to partners and potential adopters to enhance the ecosystem. I believe the noise and attention we generate today is too much within our own echo chamber as well as too hidden behind the Polkadot learning curve, and I believe that if we focus on ROI-based storytelling we can make Polkadot’s platform resonate much better with enterprise adopters.\n\nI recently did a survey of all the enterprise success stories I could find, and surprisingly there were a lot! As you can see in the image below, Polkadot ALREADY has a lot of enterprise success stories and I will work to collect, create and disseminate these stories so they spread both within and outside of the ecosystem, working hand in hand with both BD teams and ambassador teams. \n\n ![Enterprise successes.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPFsg8MCB1rkUJEMeGXEdHDWeTeTsfEwCQhGAidzGoJAp)\n\nBeyond these successes, it’s important to communicate all of the resources and support that Polkadot provides for onboarding, and funnel external parties to ecosystem support services, including but not limited to the Technical Support bounty, the BD teams around the ecosystem, the deployment infra like Tanssi/Magnet/Pop and the system integrators like BlockDeep and R0gue. And of course there are the different bounties and treasury that can help to fund integrations. These are incredible benefits that enable adoption of Polkadot, but it’s not clear enough to outsiders that they are available. I will work towards spreading the message about the support Polkadot can provide to adopters.\n\nGiven the decentralized nature of our global organization, BD teams are naturally siloed, and we can improve the “glue” that connects representative groups together. I will endeavor to help to align efforts among the different groups so that we can more easily bring wins from one group or geographic area to others.\n\nAs an HA, I will also offer 1:1 support and onboarding help for interested enterprises, to understand their needs at a first pass and connect them to the right ecosystem resources to advance to the next stage in their Polkadot journey, as well as enable other ambassadors on the team to do the same. I believe customer relationship management is very important in the pre-sales process for onboarding larger enterprises. As someone who is very familiar with the ecosystem funding opportunities (e.g. DF, W3F, Treasury, bounties/prizes) as well as the BD teams, I believe I can help newcomers in choosing the best path to enter the ecosystem. Furthermore, I will work on building and enabling champions within enterprises to spread Polkadot.\n\n2- Bringing the voice of internal stakeholders to the surface:\n\nOne key realization that hit me when I first started my DV role was how many constituencies within the ecosystem did not want to make their voices heard in governance. This happened for various reasons, including not wanting to oppose a powerful force that may retaliate, being restricted based on where they work, not having time to understand proposals in detail, not wanting to vote against friends/allies in a non-anonymized way, cultural or language barriers, personality, or not wanting to get into the politics of the situation. One aspect of what I took on in my role of DV was to seek out these voices, hear their perspective, and represent the unspoken so that their views and concerns could be heard. I believe this is still very important to enable a healthy ecosystem, and I will continue this as HA.\n\nAnother internal aspect that I feel is very important after my DV experience is bridging East and West, especially the Chinese community. Polkadot, by heritage, is largely European/Western, but Polkadot as a blockchain ecosystem is global, and should inspire and support builders from all over the world. Frequently it comes down to language/cultural barriers which just require patience and understanding to surmount. As my background is from the US and I now live in East Asia, I believe I can help to promote this region, bring new leaders in the fold and encourage voices that have not spoken as loudly yet are just as motivated to contribute. \n\n3- Creating a robust organization to set up the collective for success:\n\nFinally, I believe the role of HA is not just about public relations, BD or communication, but it requires standing up the organization of ambassadors and ensuring it can support what they need to be successful. This involves mentorship, leadership and organizational skills. I am fully committed to work with the other Head Ambassadors and rise to the challenge of setting up an efficient and effective organization. \n\nI will proactively seek out feedback from existing and past ambassadors, the community, token holders and other stakeholders in order to bring the organization forward. This will necessarily be a team effort that involves multiple stakeholders, and I see the Head Ambassadors as the responsible party for actioning the education, training, planning, satisfaction and effectiveness of the collective.\n\n**Compensation**\n\nI believe the HA funding should go towards Head Ambassador duties, which include representing Polkadot, engaging external parties such as potential adopters or investors, familiarizing oneself with the ecosystem and ecosystem participants, education and building up the collective from an operational point of view. If I receive funding from Polkadot to bring forth any initiatives I am working on, it will be segmented from HA duties.\n\n**Personal Background**\n\nI have a strong technical foundation, with a Computer Science degree from a leading institution, and I started my career as an engineer and then product manager. I later moved into the business side, e.g. sales and operations, and earned an MBA, which I feel provided a great foundation in the non-technical areas of management, communications and organizational design. I believe I can effectively bridge the worlds of tech and business and this is important both within the ecosystem and externally with potential partners and enterprise adopters.\n\nBeyond just qualifications, I think success in this role really comes down to being able to focus on and care about the people in and around Polkadot, including the builders creating the ecosystem, the teams coming in to adopt, the potential investors, the token holders, the ambassadors and the myriad other stakeholders who make up the ecosystem. I hope to have your support in this endeavor, and please reach out with any questions.\n\nWilliam\n[@replghost](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/user/replghost) on TG",

          "content": "**Introduction**\n\nHello! My name is William, and I’m applying to be a Head Ambassador (HA) for Polkadot. I would like to serve the ecosystem and work to drive forward a vibrant, effective and inclusive ambassador program. \n\nI’d like to start by describing how I view the larger context from which we operate. I believe we are at the crossroads of a few transitions for Polkadot:\n\n- the transition from 1.0 to the future, \n- the decentralization and its aftereffects, \n- and the first chapter of how we want to govern Polkadot as a DAO\n\nWe need to navigate all of these successfully for the network to flourish, but should acknowledge they inject uncertainty for participants, contributors, builders and end users. I believe the role of ambassadors is to communicate bi-directionally for the organization while bringing forth a strong case to choose Polkadot, and the role of Head Ambassadors is to lead by example and create a resilient and effective organization for ambassadors.\n\nThe foundation we establish now, not just on technical matters, but on the organizational, outreach and cultural aspects of Polkadot will lay the groundwork for network success over the next decade. While I have not been a Polkadot ambassador before, I believe that I can offer an outside perspective, seek out and listen to stakeholders, and be committed to building up the ambassador collective as a key part of the next evolution of Polkadot.\n\n**Polkadot Experience**\n\nI bring into this role the culmination of a number of different experiences in Polkadot. I started as a member of Talisman from May 2022 to May 2024, which gave me the perspective of being an ecosystem team dealing directly with end users and enterprises trying to use Polkadot. I was able to become familiar with working with many of the funding opportunities available in Polkadot, including the Polkadot treasury, the W3F grants program and the DF program, as well as the stress for teams  inherent in the application process.\n\nHowever, I feel my proper introduction to the ecosystem happened at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy HK 2024, where I got to know over 100 builders as well as instructors from W3F, Parity, the Fellowship and the ecosystem. I was able to learn about the design and operation of Polkadot on a deeper level, and this inspired me to volunteer my candidacy to be a Decentralized Voice for the first cohort, to help steward governance. I believe that I served with integrity and care in the position.

      "content": "Konichi-wa from Tokyo, Japan!\n\nMy name is Michiko Watanabe (渡辺 径子) and I would like to become a Head Ambassador for Polkadot in Japan. \n\nI learned the first time about Bitcoin from Mt. Gox incident in Tokyo, although I was not affected myself luckily. I later traded some ETH and learned about Polkadot in 2021, when Astar did para-chain. This made me very interested, and I listen to a lot of speeches from the creator of Astar, Mr. Sota Watanabe. (We share the same last name but are not a family 😂 Watanabe is a very common name in Japan) I also like Mr. Gavin who I often watch on Youtube to study, and also met in person during his trip to Japan. Polkadot is a third generation blockchain, and has many use cases in the enterprise adoption. \n\nMy personal background is in enterprise software implementation for Salesforce in Japan. I worked at the company over 6 years for clients such as Toyota, SoftBank, Mizuho Securities and ANA Airlines. As a lead project manager I helped them implement new products that improve efficiency. However, after 6 years I became a little bit bored to work in traditional software, and would like to move full-time to Web3. \n\nSince Polkadot is my favorite blockchain technology, I have also organized many events in the past such as an Introduction to Polkadot at the Salesforce Office Tokyo during 2021 which was attended by 50 people. I am also an organizer of the Polkadot meetup in Shibuya. We have met many times last year and this year to chat about Polkadot and explain the technology to people new to Web3. I think this meetup is very helpful and many people from Japan corporates attend who want to learn to improve their technology (for example supply chain trading, commerce, transportation).\n\nAstar has made a change to “zkEVM Polygon”, so we’re not sure if this is good idea. I personally believe Polkadot is better 🙂 In Japan there are many corporation that want to build interesting Web3 project, but they are not so familiar with Polkadot. So I think I will do more meetup in Tokyo. Also I have background in enterprise software, so as Ambassador I can help Japan companies adopt Polkadot technology easily. \n\nThank you for consideration, \nMichiko\n",

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Application: Alice und Bob",
      "content": "**Good Morning!**\n\nI am **Tommi Enenkel**, also known as **Alice und Bob** ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0alQ35JKnMo_ctzYITthbw), [LinkedIn](http://linkedin/)). This is my application as Polkadot Head Ambassador.\n\n## Background\n\nIn Polkadot, I co-founded [ChaosDAO](https://twitter.com/ChaosDAO) and [OpenGov.Watch](http://OpenGov.Watch). I am a Web3 strategist specializing in ecosystem development, governance, analytics, and crypto-economics. I previously held CIO and CMO roles and have a systems architecture and political communications background. I hold an MSc in Knowledge Management and IT Security. My master’s thesis explored agile software development and governance practices in open-source communities.\n\n## My previous work for Polkadot\n\n**Some highlights:**\n\n- Curating a decentralized [Polkadot 2.0 Strategy](https://www.notion.so/Polkadot-2-0-Strategy-264b338f38184248acbf630879f8386f?pvs=21) to ensure that all essential functions for growing the ecosystem are covered and we develop a shared direction\n- Representation at conferences/events such as Polkadot Decoded, Sub0, Parachain Summit, DOTBrno, DOTPrague, and local meetups\n- Lecturing at the Polkadot Blockchain Academy on the topics of OpenGov and Tokenomics\n- Moderating the monthly Technical Fellowship OpenDev call\n- Co-Founded ChaosDAO\n\nI am curating a dedicated page with more info about my portfolio. Check it out here:\n\n[Portfolio Tommi](https://www.notion.so/Portfolio-Tommi-822c27eb404941a3a7959a35b805d81d?pvs=21) \n\n## How I see the Head Ambassador Role\n\nThings I expect from Head Ambassadors:\n\n- Role model: Authentically represent the values and virtues of Polkadot and Web3\n- Evangelist: Be in the field (online and offline) and campaign for Polkadot\n- Mentor: Personally help ambassadors and community members better understand Polkadot and empower them to represent it to others.\n- Magician: Understand that your actions are the cause for new things to happen. A single conversation can spark a new project create a lead for a new deal or inspire someone to achieve great things. Actively use your powers to make good things happen.\n\nAs such, these are also the things I strive to do.\n\n## My Offer as Head Ambassador\n\n- **Shape the Ambassador program:** Old and new ambassadors are coming together to create something great. I want to help shape the program and set it up to become a successful organization. Head Ambassadors have to work as a team, so we need to establish the proper culture from the start. Different Head Ambassadors have different strengths, so I will offer mine and look for the strengths of others.\n- **Teach Web3 values:** I am a fundamentals guy. The tech is changing the world, no matter how much degens cry about prices and the latest hot shit, etc... I educate about why we build Web3 and connect the dots to the bigger themes. This is not only important for newbies, but especially for everyone deciding to “grow up” and take Web3 seriously. Mentoring people on this journey takes time and we need to commit to giving ambassadors the time and attention they deserve on their path.\n- **Ambass:** At the moment, I represent Polkadot mostly via Social Media (Twitter, a bit of LinkedIn) and through irregular video production.\n    - **Video Production:** If elected Head Ambassador, my main focus for evangelization would be through content production. I would ramp up my video production again to regularly produce videos on fundamental questions and educational topics in the Polkadot space. The themes would be the current big discussions of Polkadot since I believe that agenda-setting and influencing the narrative is a core responsibility for ambassadors.\n    - **Conferences/Events:** I also represent Polkadot on stage at conferences as opportunities open up. My main topics are introductions to Polkadot, Polkadot Strategy, and OpenGov.\n    - **Business Development:** I have 2 years of Web3 BD experience, but wouldn’t make it an emphasis of my term. I believe quite a few other HA candidates are better able to serve the time required to do proper BD. My focus here would be to capture leads when they present themselves and then relay them to the relevant parties. One way I proactively approach in small but hopefully effective ways is that I throw out ideas that I think OpenGov would fund if someone bites help them move along (for example here baiting with a [Cardano-Polkadot](https://x.com/alice_und_bob/status/1786145294536643038) bridge and then supporting the project once it starts [here](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/cardano-polkadot-bridge/8543))\n\n## Modalities\n\n### Compensation\n\nAt the moment, I have a contract with the Web3 Foundation as part of Decentralized Futures and I do not require additional pay. Under the current situation, I would not use the compensation as salary. I would only use it to pay for operational costs like content production & traveling to events where I represent Polkadot. The primary focus would be to hire a video producer to ramp up production.\n\n### Available Time\n\nI work exclusively for Polkadot. I consider my main line of work at the moment as ecosystem development, which consists of solving problems, analyzing things, and sharing knowledge.\n\nI spend significant time preparing and presenting presentations for conferences as well as agenda-setting and narrative development on Twitter, so imo there is a strong synergy to the role. I believe that the Ambassador program is very important for the community development of Polkadot and will provide the time that the role requires to help it come to fruition.\n\nIf it turns out that my other responsibilities are not compatible time-wise or a larger part of the community is not happy with my performance, I will offer the place to someone else.\n\nI am in the process of proposing a new Ecosystem Development Collective which I hope to co-lead. Should that situation become a reality and be incompatible with the HA role, I will also give the HA spot to the next candidate.",

      "content": "![HA 2024.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWsJat422JJ9YpzhGVGE455sejJSZKErzyThobfiPzSbG)\n\nGreetings dear Polkadot community!\n\nI’m [Irina Karagyaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/irina-karagyaur/) ([X](https://x.com/IrinaKaragyaur)) and this is my application for the Polkadot Head Ambassador position.\n\nI want to begin this application by sharing a little about my journey in this wonderful ecosystem. First, I was honored to join the Polkadot community back in August 2020 and began advocating for it in my local community in London UK where I was based at the time. Those days I held many activities during that summer, and as a result I was invited to my first interview about Polkadot on [Cryptonites TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17_1yyqYkd8) in September 2020. \n\nConsidering my background in management consulting and business development, my primary focus in the Polkadot ecosystem has always been on identifying the growth and development opportunities while consistently connecting active members of the Polkadot ecosystem with my business network. Thanks to that work, I was deeply humbled to be promoted to Polkadot Head Ambassador for Western Europe.\n\nSince joining the program, I have provided systematic support to the Web3 Foundation Collaborations team and later to the Parity BD team, always looking forward to bringing new opportunities into the Polkadot ecosystem. This included:\n\n- Onboarding new ambassadors for Western Europe, \n- Onboarding to a [Thousand Validators program](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/thousand-validators), \n- Introducing the Foundation for International Blockchain and Real Estate Expertise in my capacity as a Co-Chair for London to Polkadot (Organized and hosted the first [DeFi & Real Estate ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/real-estate/events/2021/mar/defi-real-estate-mechanics-decentralised-trust) academic event in partnership with [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) & [FIBREE](https://fibree.org/)). \n- I have a proven track record of onboarding new parachain teams and DApps into the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nAdditionally I have contributed to Polkadot by:\n\n- Facilitating the creation of the report [Polkadot & Cosmos for Enterprise](https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/project/cosmos-and-polkadot-for-the-enterprise/)\n- Moderation of  several events, for example [Polkadot Decoded Impact Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMqvJjrhISg), contributing to the event's success.\n- Creator of [PolkaOscar ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01EfSESigA)\n- Representation of Polkadot at the International level in various events. First at the **United Nations COP26** (first in history NFT collection presented at the United Nations). Then later in the **United Nations COP27** where I included Polkadot as the main sponsor and program partner for the Digital Innovation Pavilion. In that location, I helped with a hybrid panel discussion about Polkadot technology and sustainability. Last year in **COP28** I co-hosted the **Digital Innovation Pavilion **and represented Polkadot in my capacity as Head Ambassador as well while I held a hybrid fireside with Polkadot Blockchain Academy. Apart from those activities, at the  **UNESCO HQ** in Paris with the invaluable help of Polkadot treasury (Gov1 model) I contributed to, organize and curate the first ever Web3 & NFT exhibition called “Reconciliation with the Living”, which is a milestone in the art world. Represented Polkadot as HA and introduced Web3 and Decentralization concept and narrative at the  ITU HQ in Geneva; represented Polkadot at [UN Geneva Forum 2022](https://www.osi-genevaforum.org/United-Nations-2022-December-13-Smart-Finance-Cryptocurrencies-for-Peace-and.html)\n\nIn the <ins>curation</ins> field I served as a Sub-Curator for events bounty and currently serve as a curator for BD Bounty and Games Bounty. Very recently, I was honored to be selected as a [W3F Decentralized Voices Cohort II delegate](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-cohort-2-b10ddb7c71cc).\n\nAs a <ins>volunteer</ins> as an editor and expert contributor to International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Focus Group on Metaverse (FG-MV), and served as a mentor for the UN Women Mentorship Program, Member and Expert Contributor of the Culture and Creative Industries (CCI) Taskforce UN Climate Change Global Innovation Hub (UNFCCC), EU Climate Pact Ambassador for Spain at the European Commission.\n\nFortunately my work has been acknowledged with several awards and recognitions.

First, I was honored to join the Polkadot community back in August 2020 and began advocating for it in my local community in London UK where I was based at the time. Those days I held many activities during that summer, and as a result I was invited to my first interview about Polkadot on [Cryptonites TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17_1yyqYkd8) in September 2020. \n\nConsidering my background in management consulting and business development, my primary focus in the Polkadot ecosystem has always been on identifying the growth and development opportunities while consistently connecting active members of the Polkadot ecosystem with my business network. Thanks to that work, I was deeply humbled to be promoted to Polkadot Head Ambassador for Western Europe.\n\nSince joining the program, I have provided systematic support to the Web3 Foundation Collaborations team and later to the Parity BD team, always looking forward to bringing new opportunities into the Polkadot ecosystem. This included:\n\n- Onboarding new ambassadors for Western Europe, \n- Onboarding to a [Thousand Validators program](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/thousand-validators), \n- Introducing the Foundation for International Blockchain and Real Estate Expertise in my capacity as a Co-Chair for London to Polkadot (Organized and hosted the first [DeFi & Real Estate ](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/real-estate/events/2021/mar/defi-real-estate-mechanics-decentralised-trust) academic event in partnership with [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) & [FIBREE](https://fibree.org/)). \n- I have a proven track record of onboarding new parachain teams and DApps into the Polkadot ecosystem. \n\nAdditionally I have contributed to Polkadot by:\n\n- Facilitating the creation of the report [Polkadot & Cosmos for Enterprise](https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/project/cosmos-and-polkadot-for-the-enterprise/)\n- Moderation of  several events, for example [Polkadot Decoded Impact Stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMqvJjrhISg), contributing to the event's success.\n- Creator of [PolkaOscar ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x01EfSESigA)\n- Representation of Polkadot at the International level in various events. First at the **United Nations COP26** (first in history NFT collection presented at the United Nations). Then later in the **United Nations COP27** where I included Polkadot as the main sponsor and program partner for the Digital Innovation Pavilion. In that location, I helped with a hybrid panel discussion about Polkadot technology and sustainability. Last year in **COP28** I co-hosted the **Digital Innovation Pavilion **and represented Polkadot in my capacity as Head Ambassador as well while I held a hybrid fireside with Polkadot Blockchain Academy. Apart from those activities, at the  **UNESCO HQ** in Paris with the invaluable help of Polkadot treasury (Gov1 model) I contributed to, organize and curate the first ever Web3 & NFT exhibition called “Reconciliation with the Living”, which is a milestone in the art world. Represented Polkadot as HA and introduced Web3 and Decentralization concept and narrative at the  ITU HQ in Geneva; represented Polkadot at [UN Geneva Forum 2022](https://www.osi-genevaforum.org/United-Nations-2022-December-13-Smart-Finance-Cryptocurrencies-for-Peace-and.html)\n\nIn the <ins>curation</ins> field I served as a Sub-Curator for events bounty and currently serve as a curator for BD Bounty and Games Bounty. Very recently, I was honored to be selected as a [W3F Decentralized Voices Cohort II delegate](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-voices-cohort-2-b10ddb7c71cc).\n\nAs a <ins>volunteer</ins> as an editor and expert contributor to International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Focus Group on Metaverse (FG-MV), and served as a mentor for the UN Women Mentorship Program, Member and Expert Contributor of the Culture and Creative Industries (CCI) Taskforce UN Climate Change Global Innovation Hub (UNFCCC), EU Climate Pact Ambassador for Spain at the European Commission.\n\nFortunately my work has been acknowledged with several awards and recognitions. I was named one of the [Top 100 Women of the Future](https://womenofthefuture.com/global-vol-1/).  Winner of the [2022 Rising Women in Crypto Power List by Wirex and The Cryptonomist](https://wirexapp.com/blog/post/winners-of-the-rising-women-in-crypto-power-list-2022-announced-0684). Distinguished in [Asia's 100 Women Power Leaders](https://www.whitepageinternational.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CXO-Global-Book-2023.pdf) list.

My company works on business model creation, product ideation and development & Ecosystem Strategy. \n\nCurrently I’m collaborating with  Energy Web on Web3 growth strategy and Global Leaders new community program.

Future plans.**\n\nI will consistently represent Polkadot at key events at the international level: International Telecommunications Union, United Nations, UNESCO, COP29, EU. Later this year, I will be representing Polkadot and speaking at [an international event in Warsaw](https://x.com/EuLeadership/status/1803004792718946379) in July alongside the members of European Parliament, Countries representatives to EU (ex. Former Cabinet Minister of the Netherlands), European Policy Center, European Innovation Council and some of the world's largest tech enterprises.

      "title": "Polkadot Head Ambassador Application: Ezio Rojas",
      "content": "Hello Polkadot community!\n\nI would like to present my application to be a Head Ambassador in the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nI am Ezio Rojas, I currently serve as curator of the [Spanish Bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/42), [AMI Bounty Program](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/46) and the [Business Development Polkadot in Spain & Andorra Bounty](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/40).\n\nI am in the Polkadot ecosystem since 2021. I worked at Parity Technologies from December 2021 to January 2024, where I served as Community and Social Media Manager for Latin America and Spain, from where I was leading the Spanish-speaking community within the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nIn these years I have been involved in different activities within the Polkadot ecosystem, including participating as a speaker at major global conferences such as Labitconf 2022 edition in the talk “[How to choose the right Blockchain for my company or project?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MirwzS_6uUM&t=1994s)” also participating in talks at CriptoLatinFest 2023 edition and a side event of Bitcoin Miami 2022 edition.\n\nI have also been involved in major Polkadot events, such as Polkadot Decoded, where [I participated as a speaker in 2022 ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRw7tjuLkUw&t=2s), as well as other community events in Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico and Spain, from where the Hispanic Polkadot community has grown arduously in recent years. \n\n**Background in crypto ecosystem**\n\nI started as a user in the crypto ecosystem in 2017. In 2019 I started working with Cointelegraph, where I reached by 2021 the position of Editor in Chief of the Spanish version.\nHaving a background in the media industry has helped me to get space for Polkadot in different cryptocurrency media in Spanish. Here is a list of the publications where I have managed to get Polkadot's presence:\n\n[El precio de DOT se encuentra en una importante zona de soporte](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/dot-price-is-in-an-important-support-zone)\n\n[Predicción Polkadot: ¿Qué esperar del precio de DOT a corto plazo?](https://criptotendencia.com/2023/08/22/prediccion-polkadot-que-esperar-del-precio-de-dot-a-corto-plazo/)\n\n[Conoce la actualidad, planes y perspectivas de Polkadot para el 2023](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/learn-about-the-news-perspectives-and-plans-of-polkadot-for-2023)\n\n[Interoperabilidad hacia un sistema web interconectado](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/interoperability-towards-an-interconnected-web-system)\n\n[La Zona Tres: Layer1 Talk & Polka Dot Ezio Rojas](https://www.talent-republic.tv/developer/desarrollo-de-software/la-zona-tres-layer1-talk-polka-dot-ezio-rojas/)\n\n[Episodio 56: ¿Qué es Polkadot y Cuál es su propuesta de valor? Entrevista con Ezio Rojas](https://www.criptotendencias.com/podcast/episodio-56-que-es-polkadot-y-cual-es-su-propuesta-de-valor-entrevista-con-ezio-rojas/)\n\n[Se dan a conocer los proyectos ganadores del Polkadot Hackathon LATAM 2022](https://www.criptotendencias.com/actualidad/ganadores-del-polkadot-hackathon-latam-2022/)\n\n[Se anunciaron los proyectos ganadores del Polkadot Hackathon LATAM 2022](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/the-winners-of-the-polkadot-hackathon-latam-2022-were-announced)\n\n[Deloitte aprovecha la Blockchain Kilt del ecosistema Polkadot para mejorar sus servicios](https://criptotendencia.com/2023/12/08/deloitte-aprovecha-la-blockchain-kilt-del-ecosistema-polkadot-para-mejorar-sus-servicios/)\n\n[Polkadot presenta reporte de 2023 con crecimiento](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/polkadot-reports-2023-with-growth)\n\n[La Web3 toma la UBA: Dr. Gavin Wood presenta JAM, el protocolo que revolucionará el futuro de Internet](https://criptoinforme.com/eventos/la-web3-toma-la-uba-dr-gavin-wood-presenta-jam-el-protocolo-que-revolucionara-el-futuro-de-internet/)\n\n[La revolución de la Web3: Dr. Gavin Wood elige a la UBA para lanzar JAM ](https://www.criptotendencias.com/criptoeventos/la-revolucion-de-la-web3-dr-gavin-wood-elige-a-la-uba-para-lanzar-jam/)\n\n[Argentina: Comenzó en Buenos Aires “Polkadot Blockchain Academy”](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/argentina-polkadot-blockchain-academy-has-begun-in-buenos-aires)\n\nAlso, in 2022 I co-founded the [Caracas Blockchain Week](https://caracasblockchainweek.com/), the largest Web3 conference in Venezuela and one of the largest in Latin America, with more than 3000 attendees in 5 days. In 2023 we had the second edition, reaching 3200 attendees and the first crypto-hackathon in Venezuela. \n\nIn both editions, given my role as co-founder, Polkadot appeared as a sponsor of the event, without representing an expense for the ecosystem. Its appearance was totally free.\n\nAlso, delving into my background within the crypto ecosystem, I should mention that in the year 2022 I was listed as one of the personalities of the cryptocurrency ecosystem in Latin America that year, an [award given by the BeInCrypto team](https://es-beincrypto-com.webpkgcache.com/doc/-/s/es.beincrypto.com/top-personalidades-ecosistema-cripto-america-latina-2022/).\n\n**Goals to develop**\n\nBeyond everything I have already executed and accomplished in the ecosystem, I have a clear vision of the future for the functions I hope to perform as Head Ambassador. \n\nMy pillars as Head Ambassador will be 3:\n\n1. Expansion of Polkadot's Reach:\n- Focus on key audiences: Prioritize the dissemination of Polkadot in scenarios aimed at entrepreneurs, Venture Capital firms and other relevant players in this market within the Spanish-speaking ecosystem.\n- Strategic communication: Implement effective communication strategies to amplify knowledge about Polkadot, highlighting its competitive advantages and disruptive potential.\n\n2. Drive Adoption:\n- Promotion of parachains and appchains: Encourage the adoption of Polkadot's parachains, appchains and end products among the Spanish-speaking public, with the objective of increasing the active user base on the network.\n- Educational campaigns: Develop and implement face-to-face educational campaigns aimed at end users, highlighting the benefits and practical use cases of Polkadot-based solutions.\n\n3. Development Promotion:\n- Creation of training spaces: Facilitate the creation of training spaces for Spanish-speaking developers interested in building on Polkadot and its parachains.\n- Community building: Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers, fostering the growth of a vibrant community interested in building on Polkadot.\n\nIn order to materialize my vision in the established pillars, I will carry out the following actions:\n\n**Visibility and Outreach:**\n- Presence in relevant events: Ensure Polkadot's participation in major conferences and Web3 events within the Spanish-speaking ecosystem. Facilitate the presence of parachains, appchains and final products developed in the network.\n- Events for end users: Promote the realization of meetings where Polkadot, its parachains, appchains and end products are presented.\n- Hackathons and training: Encourage the participation of Polkadot in hackathons in the region and organize workshops and training spaces for developers interested in the technology.\n**Marketing and Adoption:**\n- Marketing campaigns: Collaboration for the development of marketing campaigns focused on end users within the region, disseminating information about parachains, appchains and end products of the network.\n- Community Promotion: Revitalize the local Spanish-speaking community, integrating new ambassadors and enhancing the work of current ambassadors.\n**Communication and Diffusion:**\n- Media publications: Manage the publication of press releases related to the Polkadot ecosystem and its parachains in the region's media, both specialized and general interest.\n\n**My team**\n\nIn order to achieve these goals, a multidisciplinary team with extensive experience in the region has been established. I will be accompanied by:\n\nCarlos Rodriguez\n\nDeveloper relations, Blockchain and web3 builder and Polkadot & Astar technical ambassador\n\nRoberto Heredia\n\nData Scientist by training and self-taught Web Developer. Physics and Mathematics teacher. Enthusiast and disseminator of Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Ambassador of Polkadot Colombia.\n\nSantiago Guzman\n\nBusiness Growth Manager Colombia on CoinX Global. CEO and Founder of Cripto Latin Fest. Independent event consultant.
