      "content": "**Overview:**\n\nOpenGov faces challenges due to the prevalent use of social media, Telegram, and Discord groups, as well as traditional discussion forums, which exhibit certain limitations e.g: Lack of structured debate, no argument visualization, potential for echo chambers, inefficient fragmentation of community discussions, risk of misinformation, decision making intransparency, tendency for off-topic discussions and risk of misinformation. These reasons and the lack of transparency in the opinions and views of OpenGov user/voters can lead to user disengagement and potentially bad and expensive DOA decisions.\n\nI would like to suggest a new way of discussing OpenGov proposals.\n\nWe should aim for a discussion forum designed to **facilitate structured, thoughtful discussion** on a wide range of topics. The discussions should also be in a **clear, tree-like structure**, making it **easy to follow** the logical flow of **arguments and counterarguments**. It should offer a unique **debate format** that allows users to **constructively explore arguments** for and against various positions, with the aim of **promoting critical thinking** and a deeper understanding of complex issues.\n\nThe setup should encourage users to **contribute thoughtfully** and to **consider multiple perspectives**, **enhancing the quality of discourse** on the platform. The discussion platform should integrate a system for tracking and reflecting changes in consensus, allowing users to see how **opinions evolve over time**. We should be fostering **structured and focused debates**, and significantly **enhancing the quality of online discussions and decisions**.\n\n**Proposed Solution:** We propose a new discussion forum with features designed to enhance transparency and effectiveness:\n\n* Structured Debates: Logical organization of arguments with interactive tree structures and easy pro/con identification.\n* Enhanced Navigation: Features for efficient exploration and tracking debate evolution.\n* In-Depth Analysis: Tools for argument evaluation, consensus highlighting, and source integration.\n* Q\\&A: Ask argument specific questions to the proposal author. Users can rate the question and answers for immediate feedback.\n* Compromise: Tools for suggesting and evaluating compromises facilitate collaborative problem-solving, benefiting the negotiation process.\n* Analytics Dashboard: Real-time updates on argument strength and community focus.\n* Timeline Slider: Visualize argument development and discussion shifts over time.\n\n**Benefits:** This platform will streamline discussions, prevent misinformation, enhance transparency, and encourage meaningful engagement by integrating diverse opinions and structured analysis tools. It aims to build a more informed and participative OpenGov community.\n\n \n\nAfter so many years with traditional forums, discord, telegram and social media, its time to try something new to improve the DAO decision-making process & decision quality for a better allocation of DAO treasury funds.\n\n \n\nCheck out [argumentree.io](https://www.argumentree.io/)\n\n \n\nThe request of 1k ksm (15k $) is for a 90-day trial period use of the argumentree platform for Kusama.\n\n \n\nThank you for your support and participation!\n\nUpdate 25.07.2025\n\nNot clearly mentioned was, that after the trial period there will be a new proposal for eg. 1 year.\n\nThe idea was that during the trial period the community can discuss how such a proposal should look like and which features it should include,\n\nbut I also understand that some may want to have the discussion and clarity around that possible proposal already now, so the options are and I'm open for suggestions:\n\n1.) treasury funding of a decentralized innovative web3 discussion app in what ever form the community likes, which will then be opensource.\n\n2.) or funding through the \"New Kusama Vision\" Ref498 grant, of course then opensource.\n\n3.) or continue as Service but where the app is storing key metadata onchain, if this is an option...\n\nBut looking at the current ChaosDAO vote, the effort discussing this now seems not worth it, without talking to that central authority!",

      "title": "Online Educational Program for C-Levels : A future Kusama DAOs Academy proposal. ",
      "content": "GM Kusama Community, thanks for all the DVs and Communities providing feedback, on these failed proposal attempts:\n\n-   [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/481](https://../referenda/481)\n-   [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/478](https://../referenda/478)\n\n**Learnings:** \n\n-   — Non-speculative fund asking, use the EMA right   \n-   — This program is different from the PBA because it's focused on LATAM, the UX part that is for the interest of decision-makers at operational, transparency, and regulatory level.\n\n**Acknowledgments:** \n\n-   — The time between proposals is too long. Why? Familiar medical issues and operational alliances were not confirmed.  We keep prospecting and closing as we reach organizations. \n-   — At some AAG Jay asked me \"Why on Kusama?\" and yes not only because of fast approvals, but because Kusama represents chaos, represents non-orthodox methods, continue testing and developing, like any new organization or project, and Kusama is getting mature and taking a new path from their cousin, a path on which we need people to explore the chaos and possibilities of working with true permissionless technology, only ruled by consensus. New countries could born over the decades on top of Kusama, and ghost countries or organizations could also develop for the greater good or for evil, who knows, tech should be neutral, right? But people, professionals, and decision-makers need information, and education, to get their thoughts out of the box. \n\n**The Kusama DAO Academy, or DotSama ecosystem learning through e-learning platform and institutional alliances.**\n\n**Kusama DAO Academy (KDA)** is an educational program designed to train companies, institutions, and organizations in blockchain technology, with a special focus on the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem. The initiative aims to promote the adoption of decentralized tools such as multisig, DIDs, NFTs, and decentralized financial mechanisms.\n\n\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**We request 1,050 KSM (~$21,000 USD) 1 KSM = 20 USD EMA= 30 days to develop and launch the program, ensuring its sustainability and expansion in Latin America, for the next 6 months.** \n\n**\\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**\n\nGrowDAO the team behind this project, successfully provided education to professionals of big corporations and Universities in Mexico and Colombia such as Grupo Salinas, Banco Agrario de Colombia, Certi Cámara, Tecnológico de Monterrey and Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana. \n\nWe acknowledge that if we leave the ecosystem for any reason the community will be affected, that's why we must accomplish this so the community can have it open source and, other Hispanic DAOs or the Ambassadors Programme can benefit from it. (I love this ecosystem, and do better every day to stay with it)\n\n**Project Objectives**\n\n— Blockchain Education for Companies and Institutions: Teach organizations how to use blockchain technology for fund management, transparency, and operational efficiency.\n\n— Adoption of Kusama/Polkadot: Integrate native ecosystem tools into teaching and certification processes.\n\n— Self-Sustaining Model: Generate revenue through paid certifications and partnerships with universities and companies. (on the mid-run) \n\n— Open Source Content: Publish educational materials for other DAOs and communities to use and expand upon.\n\n**Structure and Implementation Plan**\n\nEducational Content\n\n-   6 structured modules on Moodle, accessible via web and mobile devices.\n-   Key topics: Blockchain security, DIDs, smart contracts, decentralized governance, multisig usage, and more.\n-   Video lessons, PDFs, case studies, and interactive assessments.\n-   1st iteration videos (currently we are updating them to be suitable for Moodle, and zooming into the ecosystem) \n\n[First iteration playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXZqxlHO4Jc&list=PLUFb_0vDG6JlkpLyLNhqeg3kVxGgNouts&index=11)\n\n**Adoption Strategy and Partnerships**\n\n— FintechU Mx: Official certification recognized by the fintech sector in Mexico, national and international curricular value for the students. FintechU Mx has a specialized curriculum about fintech and blockchain in LATAM, they have graduated more than 1000 students from many C-Level positions at many startups and corporates in LATAM. \n\n[Collaboration Letter:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jxuOKdAZ5KxHrcey6BZ8A5zV24jbmF-o/view?usp=sharing)  \n\nThis collaboration will take the course of DAO School to their enrolled students and alumni, and it will be an administration cost covered by the student to get certificated nationally and internationally (50 USD) this is an administrative pay for FintechU we as GrowDAO not charge for this. The asked funds cover all our work for the next 6 months. \n\n[FintechU Mx Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16ZoS2BqhKa0bRuyCAQh78pOpYVqUFA0e/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104299030626080428246&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\n— Universities: Exploring integration with UAM Cuajimalpa and other institutions.\n\n— Podcast \"GM Crypto News\": Content dissemination through YouTube and Spotify.\n\n**Infrastructure and Development**\n\n— Moodle-based platform hosted on a dedicated server. (Currently a home web server 2500U Ryzen 5, 12 GB RAM) Our plan for the next 6 months is to consolidate an alliance with a public college willing to host and offer the course to the students, and professors. \n\n— Production of audiovisual content and creation of educational materials in accessible formats. (Podcast and video material for Moodle)\n\n— Open Source the Moodle Content so any DAO can use it. \n\n**Funding and Sustainability**\n\nEstimated cost: **1,050 KSM (~$21,000 USD) 1 KSM = 20 USD EMA=30 days**\n\nFuture revenue sources:\n\n— Certifications: $50 USD per student. (Academic institution register future 12 months)\n\n— Partnerships with companies and universities.\n\n— Expansion of the model to other regions.\n\n**Benefits for the Kusama/Polkadot Ecosystem**\n\n✅ Increased adoption of DIDs, multisig, and NFTs in business environments.\n\n✅ Positioning the ecosystem in Latin America through certified education.\n\n✅ Creation of an Open Source repository with educational content accessible to other DAOs and communities.\n\n✅ Generation of new use cases that drive the real-world utility of Kusama/Polkadot.\n\n**Success Metrics and Evaluation**\n\n🚀 Initial Goal: 100 certified students in the first 6 months.\n\n🔗 Strategic Partnerships: At least 2 universities and 3 companies adopting decentralized tools.\n\n💡 Documented Use Cases: Companies implementing solutions based on Kusama/Polkadot.\n\n📈 Course Completion Rate: At least 70% of enrolled students complete certification.\n\nHere's the [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iHpatwk6R7y59-TRQpMYYgPKbDg1xZI-XUcoJkX5ufw/edit?usp=sharing), which is still changing due to community feedback. Please, reach me at:\n\n-   Discord: j3rga\n-   Telegram: j3rga\n-   email: [edoga.salinas@gmail.com](mailto:edoga.salinas@gmail.com)\n\nKusama DAO Academy represents a strategic opportunity to strengthen the adoption of Kusama/Polkadot in Latin America through quality education and applicable use cases. With the requested funding, we will ensure the program's development, implementation, and future sustainability, impacting hundreds of students and organizations.\n\nWe invite the Kusama community to support this initiative and contribute to building a stronger, globally adopted ecosystem. 🚀🌎\n\nPlease reach me, comment, share, let me know what you need, how we can collaborate, etc, no one can go further without help, thank you all. We also want to connect with other initiatives, I'll be connecting with them, if you know of any project not well-known please share. \n\n**Future on-chain proposal: Online Educational Program for C-Levels**",

This goes to show our dedication to the topic and the community. They can be observed here: [Phase 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1118), [Phase 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1245), [Phase 3](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1589), [Phase 4](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1817) and [Phase 5](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2057). We are also pushing development onwards in other cross-chain topics in the ecosystem. For example, the [xcNFT pallet](https://paraspell-research.github.io/xcnft-docs/) meant to allow users to **transfer NFTs** through XCM - [Link](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2358).\n-   We have been granted trust from the Kusama community multiple times in the following maintenance proposals that helped us further perfect XCM Tools: [Maintenance 1](../referenda/277), [Maintenance 2](../referenda/344) and [Maintenance 3](../referenda/417). [Maintenance 2](../referenda/344) is also historically 🥇first maintenance-related referenda to receive **100% AYE support** for which we are very thankful!\n-   Some of XCM Tools are partially / fully funded by participation in Hackathons (To maximize self-sufficiency when developing state-of-the-art tools).\n-   XCM API was co-funded with 🥇first place at the Polkadot Global Series APAC 2023 Hackathon in the XCM Integration track. [Here is the final announcement post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\n-   The XCM Visualizator was fully funded by 🥈second place at the Polkadot Global Series North America 2024 Hackathon in the XCM Integration track. [Here is the result announcement](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204421834795020291/)\n-   Knowledge and funds are reinvested into professional research articles 👨‍🏫 - Promoting Polkadot and ParaSpell in the long run at international research conferences (We occupy the first page when you search “Polkadot XCM” on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=sk&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=polkadot+xcm&btnG=&oq=polka)). Conferences we choose are with higher standards and higher Z-indexes. We were so far able to publish a total of 7 professional research articles and 2 journals:\n    -   Sharing fungible assets across Polkadot Paraverse: IEEE ICECET 2022 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9872938)\n    -   Enhancing XCMP Interoperability Across Polkadot Paraverse: IEEE ICBC 2023 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174872)\n    -   ParaSpell XCM SDK: A New Protocol for Interoperability in Polkadot Paraverse: IEEE BCCA 2023 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10338906)\n    -   Cross-Chain Payments on Blockchain Networks: An Apartment Booking Use-Case: ACM SAC 2024 - [link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3605098.3636137)\n    -   Interlinked Transactions: Revolutionizing Apartment Bookings through Cross-Chain Payments: IEEE BCCA 2024 - [link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380904884_Interlinked_Transactions_Revolutionizing_Apartment_Bookings_through_Cross-Chain_Payments)\n    -   Cross-Chain Non-Fungible Assets Sharing on Polkadot: IEEE Brains 2024 - [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10732282)\n    -   Protocol for unifying cross-chain liquidity on polkadot: Frontiers in Blockchain Journal 2024 - [link](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/blockchain/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2024.1413840/full)\n    -   Decentralized Bridge Between Polkadot and Cosmos: ACM SAC 2025 - Accepted, awaiting conference day to be presented.\n    -   UniSpell: Universal Adapter for Interoperability in Polkadot Paraverse: Cluster Computing Journal 2024 - Awaiting final approval\n\n### The team behind the project has been hacking in the Polkadot ecosystem for a while now.\n\nConsisting of 2 members:\n\n-   Dušan Morháč: [PBA 2023 Buenos Aires Alumni](https://singular.app/collectibles/statemine/20/12), Building in ecosystem since 2021, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dudo50/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/dudo50).\n-   Michael Absolon: Typescript expert with 4 years of professional experience, Building in the ecosystem since 2022, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael--absolon/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/michaeldev5).\n\nBoth team members achieved their Master's degree recently (June 2024) and are working on ParaSpell full-time. Dušan continues to study for a Doctoral degree (To be able to continue research passion and release more research papers for Polkadot and ParaSpell). Michael is registered into for PBA X and in-person PBA Campus 2025.\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\n\nThe proposal aims to aid server costs and maintenance for the 🥇 first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api) and [XCM Visualizator](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe) in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Maintaining XCM API, [XCM ROUTER](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router) and XCM Visualizator also include maintaining its core component - [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk). These common good tools along with [XCM Analyser](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser), [XCM Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/playground), [Documentation](https://github.com/paraspell/docs) and [Landing page](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/site) will be fully maintained for the mentioned period starting on 1st February 2025 and ending on 1st August 2025. This proposal allows all tools to remain completely free for the entire Polkadot and Kusama communities. It also allows ParaSpell team to dedicate time to help other teams that wish to implement XCM Tools.\n\n### What are you getting by implementing one of ParaSpell's XCM Tools or more\n\n-   Complex free support with implementation (Through a private telegram group between ParaSpell's team and your team (We usually respond within minutes and we are also open to live calls when time plays a role in your project delivery - form to reach out to us can be found on ParaSpell's [Landing page](https://paraspell.xyz/)))\n-   Prompt issue solving if any occurs (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n-   Constant updates for every package (We strive to bring new features for each tool)\n-   Comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) for each tool\n-   Reliability (Checked each month for changes in Pallets or compatible Parachains)\n-   **Guarantee, that everything is free for everyone. The ParaSpell✨ team aims to deliver only the common good, be completely open-source and free with no hidden costs or subscriptions.**\n\n### What are you getting as a non-developer/dApp user by supporting this proposal\n\n-   XCM tools allow dApps to be created much faster, so you can enjoy their benefits quicker.\n-   You can be sure, that dApp implementing XCM tools is safe for XCM as XCM Tools are thoroughly tested and regularly updated. There are multiple ways to lose assets cross-chain.\n-   You, too, can try XCM Tools via the [Playground](https://playground.paraspell.xyz/).\n-   The XCM Tools team has been in the ecosystem for a while now, and we are hardcore ecosystem fans. We will continue maintaining the tools even if we are short of funding (Just at a slower pace). So you do not have to deal with your dApp suddenly disabling your favourite feature. This is because we primarily build and maintain these tools to make life easier for everyone - not for profits (There is no business model or hidden fees in any of ParaSpell's XCM Tools. They are purely common good).\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n-   Discussion: 7. January. 2025 - 13. January. 2025\n-   Voting: 14. January. 2025 - 28. January. 2025\n\n## Proposal ask\n\nThe proposal seeks 45.990$ worth of funding for 6 months of various maintenance tasks, research, and improvement tasks, as well as assistance to other teams. This is divided into 7.665$ per month and 23,95$ per developer work hour (A decrease of 2000$ from the previous proposal because research articles are now fully covered by the faculty where Dušan studies). More information can be found in the full proposal document.\n\n## Documents associated with the proposal:\n\n[**Full proposal (Contains detailed information on how we plan to use funds)**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ItfZVyeR9zQ9MKhEYHlvfSE5hBEBN15MUGf3MOjJgwg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n[**PBA Alumni podcast featuring ParaSpell**](https://www.linkedin.com/events/pbapodcast-featuringpbaalumnusp7282442972397195264/comments/)\n\n[XCM Tools one pager](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuXF5a0As/ylxqRR43pe3_XRWC27IH-A/edit)\n\n[ParaSpell landing page](https://paraspell.xyz/)\n\n[Documentation for XCM Tools](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\n[Polkadot Forum post prior to proposal](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/paraspell-xcm-tools-go-cross-chain-within-seconds-latest-upgrades-future-upgrades-maintenance-report/11302)",

The second version of Escuela de DAOs focuses on offering digital courses to strengthen the knowledge and adoption of blockchain technology in companies and other organizations. In the first version, it managed to capture the interest of multiple individuals and organizations as shown in evidence in previous sections, which indicates a clear opportunity for growth.\n\n**Funding Goal:** Ensure the operation, growth and scalability of the DAO School to attract new users and establish key partnerships.\n\n  \n**Background and Justification  \n  \n**Based on enrollment data and feedback from the first version, we have identified that there is a growing interest in courses focused on the practical benefits and applicability of blockchain technology in organizations.\n\n-   **Proven demand:** In just the preliminary phase of the second version, 12 people have spontaneously registered, demonstrating potential for expansion.\n-   **Growth opportunity:** The DAO School seeks to educate and train a new group of students and professionals every month, with a focus on companies and entrepreneurs interested in emerging technologies.  \n      \n      \n    \n\n**Objectives of the Second Version**\n\n1.

      "title": "KUSAMA x ONE: Educating Users & Enhancing Ecosystem Visibility in Latam.",
      "content": "Our ONE app is designed for Spanish-speaking communities, offering a user-friendly experience, even for those unfamiliar with crypto.\n\nWe are proposing this to see if you would consider sponsoring us. We believe that with our strengths we can add value to the Kusama ecosystem, but we also recognize that at this stage, we need partners who are willing to experiment and try something new that still lacks broader validation.\n\nOur goal is to exceed the objectives of the proposal by helping Kusama in areas where we believe we have strengths, and later find more opportunities with Polkadot & Kusama to build a long-term relationship.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nONE is designed to empower Spanish-speaking communities with an accessible and educational experience to discover and understand blockchain ecosystems. ONE offers intuitive ecosystem visibility, short educational videos, and the ability to participate in missions that reward users for their blockchain achievements.\n\n**Key Features of ONE:**\n\n-   **Ecosystem Visibility:** Users can explore blockchains and protocols with an intuitive design that highlights projects, technologies, and strengths in a concise manner.\n-   **Short Educational Videos:** Instead of long guides, we offer brief videos that cover the user’s journey in a blockchain, from initial setup to advanced functions, all in less time and with direct understanding.\n-   **Reward-Based Missions:** Users can participate in missions designed to guide them through blockchain adoption, with token incentives for completing key actions, such as on-chain identity verification.\n\n**Main parts of ONE**\n\n1.  **Vision [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2UM8d8jpE \"Video de Visión\")**: where we categorize blockchain protocols and display Web3 Intelligence cards.  \n              **Key Features:**\n    -   Vision offers great UX for users unfamiliar with crypto and has a strong UI in mobile version, as evidenced by our user experience tests in June 2024.\n    -   The Vision cards contain new and unique fields such as project-friendly information, founders, technology summaries, and blockchains explained narratively.\n    -   Vision has a built-in analytics variation that quickly displays project summary cards (currently with tokens) to the user.\n    -   The initial Vision view uses the project’s wordmarks according to their brand assets (if available).\n    -   Vision doesn’t require projects to input information; it compiles the data by itself through research by e-Dolphin (our company).\n    -   Vision is categorized from the moment the user enters, with tooltips in all protocol subcategories to provide simple explanations.\n2.  **Tour [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j7huf5Y18s \"Video de Tour\")**: where we categorize the actions you can take on a blockchain through short action videos and explanatory videos.  \n              **Key Features:**\n    -   Tour is the most appealing section for users unfamiliar with crypto, and it has strong UX, as evidenced by our user experience tests in June 2024.\n    -   Tour includes a special categorization by action (e.g., wallets, swaps, lending, borrowing) that can be done on a blockchain and can also add special categories (for example, \"All About Kusama\").\n    -   Tour has a video-sharing option for the most popular social media platforms in Latam (WhatsApp, Facebook, and X).  \n        _In Latam, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and TikTok have over 80-90% usage in several countries, and X around 10%. Source: [https://datareportal.com/reports/?tag=Southern+America](https://datareportal.com/reports/?tag=Southern+America)_\n    -   ONE's Tour videos are published on YouTube and soon on TikTok.  \n          \n        \n3.  **Missions [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkqwltGTWcI \"Video de Misiones\"):** for users to earn rewards.  \n              **Key Features:**\n    -   Missions is appealing to both crypto users and those unfamiliar with crypto, as evidenced by our user experience tests in June 2024.\n    -   Missions has larger and more detailed cards and includes a simple participation system (users can click to register and then submit proofs).\n    -   Missions is designed to include any type of campaign that projects want to incentivize on their networks and/or protocols. It is also versatile and can experiment with new types of campaigns.\n    -   Missions also has categorization, but it’s more narrowly focused.\n\n**Problem**\n\nWe’ve identified seven key problems that our proposal could address:\n\n1.  Limited material available in Spanish.\n2.  Difficulty in quickly making Kusama and its ecosystem visible to new users.\n3.  Possible perception of Kusama as a test network.\n4.  Increasingly competitive multichain market. It’s harder to generate adoption among users already familiar with crypto.\n5.  Barrier for non-technical users. The user journey in Kusama can be more complex compared to other networks, and it takes longer to learn, especially for communities that don’t read English or have different educational backgrounds.\n6.  Technical complexity. Kusama has a highly advanced and unique architecture, along with an impressive decentralized governance system, which can be intimidating for users coming from simpler networks or those getting to know the network for the first time.\n7.  Very few use cases that address local issues in Latam.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe aim to position Kusama as a network for radical innovation in Spanish (1, 2, 3, and 4) by increasing its visibility and knowledge of its ecosystem (1 and 2), improving the onboarding experience (5), creating more educational resources (6), and promoting a campaign to encourage users to engage with the network (7).\n\n-   **Enhancing visibility and ecosystem awareness:** Add the Kusama ecosystem to our Vision section and make it easier for new parachains and ecosystem dapps to be listed.\n-   **Improving onboarding and creating more educational resources:** A user-centered approach through: (1) creating a user journey for Kusama called \"All About Kusama\" with action videos covering the basic user experience, and (2) explaining Kusama’s main strengths and tools through \"Kusama Explained,\" using educational videos (more technical, but user-friendly). Both will be in our Tour section and published on YouTube and TikTok.\n-   **Promoting a campaign for users to engage with the network:** Launch a Kusama \"on-chain identity\" mission, allowing users to create wallets, send funds from CEX to Kusama, and verify their identity. This way, they’ll be ready to experiment with governance or use the network for remittances—use cases that are highly relevant in Latam, don’t require new developments, and can be reinforced through the mission.\n\n**Available Solutions**\n\nWe’ve identified solutions related to our Vision section in ONE, but they are not available in Spanish. We haven’t found similar solutions to our Tour and Missions sections related to Kusama.\n\n-   [Kusama Guide:](https://guide.kusama.network/docs/kusama-getting-started) Not available in Spanish. It could be related to our Vision section.\n-   [Parachains.info:](https://parachains.info/) Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem projects directory. Not available in Spanish.

          "content": "Our ONE app is designed for Spanish-speaking communities, offering a user-friendly experience, even for those unfamiliar with crypto.\n\nWe are proposing this to see if you would consider sponsoring us. We believe that with our strengths we can add value to the Kusama ecosystem, but we also recognize that at this stage, we need partners who are willing to experiment and try something new that still lacks broader validation.\n\nOur goal is to exceed the objectives of the proposal by helping Kusama in areas where we believe we have strengths, and later find more opportunities with Polkadot & Kusama to build a long-term relationship.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nONE is designed to empower Spanish-speaking communities with an accessible and educational experience to discover and understand blockchain ecosystems. ONE offers intuitive ecosystem visibility, short educational videos, and the ability to participate in missions that reward users for their blockchain achievements.\n\n**Key Features of ONE:**\n\n-   **Ecosystem Visibility:** Users can explore blockchains and protocols with an intuitive design that highlights projects, technologies, and strengths in a concise manner.\n-   **Short Educational Videos:** Instead of long guides, we offer brief videos that cover the user’s journey in a blockchain, from initial setup to advanced functions, all in less time and with direct understanding.\n-   **Reward-Based Missions:** Users can participate in missions designed to guide them through blockchain adoption, with token incentives for completing key actions, such as on-chain identity verification.\n\n**Main parts of ONE**\n\n1.  **Vision [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2UM8d8jpE \"Video de Visión\")**: where we categorize blockchain protocols and display Web3 Intelligence cards.  \n              **Key Features:**\n    -   -   Vision offers great UX for users unfamiliar with crypto and has a strong UI in mobile version, as evidenced by our user experience tests in June 2024.\n        -   The Vision cards contain new and unique fields such as project-friendly information, founders, technology summaries, and blockchains explained narratively.\n        -   Vision has a built-in analytics variation that quickly displays project summary cards (currently with tokens) to the user.\n        -   The initial Vision view uses the project’s wordmarks according to their brand assets (if available).\n        -   Vision doesn’t require projects to input information; it compiles the data by itself through research by e-Dolphin (our company).\n        -   Vision is categorized from the moment the user enters, with tooltips in all protocol subcategories to provide simple explanations.\n2.  **Tour [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j7huf5Y18s \"Video de Tour\")**: where we categorize the actions you can take on a blockchain through short action videos and explanatory videos.  \n              **Key Features:**\n    -   -   Tour is the most appealing section for users unfamiliar with crypto, and it has strong UX, as evidenced by our user experience tests in June 2024.\n        -   Tour includes a special categorization by action (e.g., wallets, swaps, lending, borrowing) that can be done on a blockchain and can also add special categories (for example, \"All About Kusama\").\n        -   Tour has a video-sharing option for the most popular social media platforms in Latam (WhatsApp, Facebook, and X).  \n            _In Latam, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and TikTok have over 80-90% usage in several countries, and X around 10%. Source: [https://datareportal.com/reports/?tag=Southern+America](https://datareportal.com/reports/?tag=Southern+America)_\n        -   ONE's Tour videos are published on YouTube and soon on TikTok.  \n              \n            \n3.  **Missions [(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkqwltGTWcI \"Video de Misiones\"):** for users to earn rewards.  \n              **Key Features:**\n    -   -   Missions is appealing to both crypto users and those unfamiliar with crypto, as evidenced by our user experience tests in June 2024.\n        -   Missions has larger and more detailed cards and includes a simple participation system (users can click to register and then submit proofs).\n        -   Missions is designed to include any type of campaign that projects want to incentivize on their networks and/or protocols. It is also versatile and can experiment with new types of campaigns.\n        -   Missions also has categorization, but it’s more narrowly focused.\n\n**Problem**\n\nWe’ve identified seven key problems that our proposal could address:\n\n1.  Limited material available in Spanish.\n2.  Difficulty in quickly making Kusama and its ecosystem visible to new users.\n3.  Possible perception of Kusama as a test network.\n4.  Increasingly competitive multichain market. It’s harder to generate adoption among users already familiar with crypto.\n5.  Barrier for non-technical users. The user journey in Kusama can be more complex compared to other networks, and it takes longer to learn, especially for communities that don’t read English or have different educational backgrounds.\n6.  Technical complexity. Kusama has a highly advanced and unique architecture, along with an impressive decentralized governance system, which can be intimidating for users coming from simpler networks or those getting to know the network for the first time.\n7.  Very few use cases that address local issues in Latam.\n\n**Proposal**\n\nWe aim to position Kusama as a network for radical innovation in Spanish (1, 2, 3, and 4) by increasing its visibility and knowledge of its ecosystem (1 and 2), improving the onboarding experience (5), creating more educational resources (6), and promoting a campaign to encourage users to engage with the network (7).\n\n-   **Enhancing visibility and ecosystem awareness:** Add the Kusama ecosystem to our Vision section and make it easier for new parachains and ecosystem dapps to be listed.\n-   **Improving onboarding and creating more educational resources:** A user-centered approach through: (1) creating a user journey for Kusama called \"All About Kusama\" with action videos covering the basic user experience, and (2) explaining Kusama’s main strengths and tools through \"Kusama Explained,\" using educational videos (more technical, but user-friendly). Both will be in our Tour section and published on YouTube and TikTok.\n-   **Promoting a campaign for users to engage with the network:** Launch a Kusama \"on-chain identity\" mission, allowing users to create wallets, send funds from CEX to Kusama, and verify their identity. This way, they’ll be ready to experiment with governance or use the network for remittances—use cases that are highly relevant in Latam, don’t require new developments, and can be reinforced through the mission.\n\n**Available Solutions**\n\nWe’ve identified solutions related to our Vision section in ONE, but they are not available in Spanish.

To ensure that this proceeds as smoothly as possible on Polkadot and following community feedback, we would like to test it on Kusama first. To conduct this test, we require KSM to pay for the transaction fees plus to temporarily finance some existential deposits (EDs).  \n \n## Note: \nAt least 80% of the KSM spent in fees through this proposal will be returned to the treasury (see: https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury). We will also return any excess KSM remaining after spamming transactions or KSMs used for temporary EDs.\n\nAmforc takes no cut for conducting this experiment. For full disclosure, as Amforc operates validators on Kusama, these validators may occasionally collect part of the transaction fees.\n\nPlease find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YZNxvBqmpiVvHwq0yQ0EmGsnI7eCh1pieyFQ0WoNkAM)",

      "title": "Proposal for Honoring Gavin Wood through Art and Innovation",
      "content": "I am writing to propose a unique and meaningful project that not only supports an emerging artist but also honors one of our key figures, Gavin Wood. This initiative aligns with our commitment to fostering creativity and innovation within our community. Project Overview Commissioning a Portrait of Gavin Wood.\n\nWe have identified a talented artist who recently exhibited in [Barcelona](https://canal-gallery.com/producto/axe-colours-walter-white) , renowned for creating exceptional portraits of notable figures. The artist also worked for Football Club Barcelona. After an initial discussion with him, he expressed his admiration for Gavin Wood. This enthusiasm for Gavin and his work makes the artist an ideal candidate for this project. The Proposal:\n\n1.  Commission a Real Painting: o We will commission the artist to create an original painting of Gavin Wood. Canvas will be 130x195cm. This piece will capture Gavin's essence and serve as a lasting tribute to his contributions to our community and the broader technological landscape.\n2.  Creating an NFT: o In addition to the physical painting, we propose creating a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) of the artwork. This NFT will be distributed to all Kappa Sigma Mu members, symbolizing our collective appreciation and serving as a digital memento. We will make an snapshot and distribute the NFTs when the work is finished.\n3.  Presentation to Gavin Wood: o The completed painting will be presented to Gavin Wood as a token of our appreciation. It Will be sent and packed well\n4.  Marketing: o We have contacted Gavin Wood’s office, and he is willing to accept this gift and will share it on X (formerly Twitter). o We also coordinated with the artist to share the work on his Instagram profile (45K followers)\n\nCommunity Engagement: In Kusama, there is a society that rewards individuals for getting a Kusama-themed tattoo. Our goal is to support and expand this society, positioning it as the primary gateway for highly engaged and committed individuals within the Kusama ecosystem. By employing non-traditional and innovative approaches, we aim to foster a vibrant and dedicated community that not only attracts new users but also strengthens their connection to Kusama. By commissioning a painting of Gavin Wood and creating an NFT, we blend traditional art with modern technology, showcasing the positive impact of blockchain. This initiative supports a quite famous artist and unites our members, encouraging more participation and cultivating a sense of community. Next Steps\n\n1\\. Approval of the Proposal\n\nUpon approval, we will formalize the commission agreement with the artist, outlining the project scope, timeline, and deliverables.\n\n2\\. Project Execution:\n\nThe artist will begin work on the painting, with regular updates provided to ensure alignment with our vision. o Concurrently, we will work on the creation and distribution plan for the NFT.\n\n3\\. Presentation and Distribution:\n\nOnce completed, we will deliever the package to Gavin.\n\nThe NFT will be distributed to all members.\n\nConclusion This proposal represents an opportunity to blend art, technology, and community spirit in a way that honors the founder of Polkadot and Kusama. I am confident that this initiative will not only delight Gavin Wood but also reinforce the values we hold dear within Kappa Sigma Mu.\n\nTo sum up:\n\na-The artist will make a 130x195 cm portrait of Gavin Wood and we will deliever it to Gavin/Parity.\n\nb-We will make an NFT of the portrait to distribute it to the Kappa Sigma Mu members.\n\nc-Paint will be shared on the artist instagram and Gavin Wood’s X\n\nd-The total cost of the project is 506 KSM\n\n• Artist's Fee: $8000\n\n• Transportation and Handling: Additional expenses for securely transporting the painting to the desired location: 400 $ •\n\nMiscellaneous Costs: Potential costs for framing, insurance, and other unforeseen expenses: 800 $\n\nTotal: 9200$ 9200/18,15 (EMA7 KSM price)= 506 KSM\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/dK1Nh4B/rossi-murales4.jpg)\n\nThank you for considering this proposal. I look forward to your support and feedback",

Similar to kusama open gov but just faster track to make desision faster.\n\n— Native dex.\n\n— 0% fee on trade compared to 1% each trade fees on pump.fun (this improvement will allow to bring a lot of volume and users to Kusama)\n\n— Integration of Assets pallet. Config prevents RUGS so it is ONLY possible to create a token via launchpad extrinsic.\n\n— Simple user flow to execute only 1 Launchpad extrinsic that:\n\n        — creates a new (meme) token. For example GLITCH .\n\n        — creates a pool of new tokens with KSM. LP **KSM**\\-GLITCH deploy liquidity.\n\n        — buys the desired amount of tokens from the pool in the same extrinsic. (optional)\n\nI won the last [parachain slot](https://parachains.info/auctions/kusama) in Kusama history. It was called Memecoinchain.

      "title": "Drand Bridge Pallet | Retroactive Funding",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nIdeal Labs is working to develop onchain randomness solutions for substrate based chains and beyond. To date, we have participated in the web3 foundation’s grant program, where we developed a prototype version of a substrate-based randomness beacon. We are currently participants in the decentralized futures program. The work presented here is not covered within our contract with DF.\n\nVerifiable randomness is a critical component for enabling fairness in decentralized protocols. Unfortunately, existing solutions for Substrate-based chains have limitations. We are proposing retroactive funding to support the development and maintenance of a [Drand](<https://drand.love>) to Substrate bridge, bringing drand's verifiable randomness to Kusama.\n\nWe developed a [drand bridge pallet](<https://github.com/ideal-lab5/pallet-drand>), allowing Substrate-based runtimes to consume verifiable randomness from Drand's [Quicknet](<https://drand.love/blog/quicknet-is-live-on-the-league-of-entropy-mainnet>). It can be used as a drop-in replacement anywhere the Randomness trait is used. We also built a node that supports host functions built with the [arkworks-extensions](<https://github.com/paritytech/arkworks-extensions>) library, which is required to efficiently verify drand's pulses. Finally, we developed a chain extension and smart contract environment so that the output of drand can be used within ink! smart contracts, along with a demonstration rock-paper-scissors game.\n\nKey Benefits of this work include:\n\n- Robust and Verifiable onchain randomness: drand enables highly secure, robust, verifiable randomness. With this work, it is easy to use it both within pallets and smart contracts.\n- Timelock Encryption: drand's output enables us to build timelock encryption capabilities on top of the beacon, enabling new kinds of use cases for trustless protocols, such as trustless asset swaps, [keyless crypto wallets](<https://forum.polkadot.network/t/a-keyless-wallet-concept-using-timelock-encryption/7096>), and more.\n- Potential Ecocsystem Growth: EVM-based blockchains perform pairing operations poorly, so there is no cost-efficient drand > ETH bridge (though one does exist through Starknet). In general, EVM-based applications rely on VRF-based randomness-as-a-service solutions like Chainlink VRF, which carries a significant cost (also: no timelock encryption). This solution uses optimized arkworks extensions to efficiently compute pairings on-chain.\n\nThis post is to ask for feedback and review of our proposal for retroactive funding of our work on:\n\n- a [drand bridge pallet](<https://github.com/ideal-lab5/pallet-drand>)\n- a [node template supporting arkworks host functions](<https://github.com/ideal-lab5/ideal-node-template>)\n- a [chain extension]([https://github.com/ideal-lab5/pallet-drand/blob/158a0b85eb50c9ecc20a4a33d6349e8c6c6b402e/substrate-node-template/runtime/src/lib.rs#L853) and [contract environment](<https://github.com/ideal-lab5/contracts>) for using randomness in ink! smart contracts\n- A demo dapp: [casino-style rock-paper-scissors](<https://github.com/ideal-lab5/rock-paper-scissors>)\n\nRetroactive funding will allow us to maintain and enhance this pallet, where we will work to support other beacons (e.g. NIST's beacon) and eliminate current limitations (see proposal). Our goal is for this to be an easy-to-use module for other networks - solochain or parachain - to acquire secure verifiable randomness and timelock encryption capabilities.\n\nRead the full proposal here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wjn8Il3O5A51MU24CUdOhNyoU2YAABrLsWiOckM8Kg4/edit?usp=sharing](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wjn8Il3O5A51MU24CUdOhNyoU2YAABrLsWiOckM8Kg4/edit?usp=sharing>)\n\n\n\n\n",

Airdrops and NFT Rewards: Which projects offer airdrops and NFT rewards, and can I, as a user and investor, participate?\n\nFinding answers to these questions can be challenging because data and information are fragmented and dispersed across various projects within the Polkadot ecosystem. This fragmentation not only reduces the efficiency of information retrieval and usage, leading to a poor user experience, but also significantly increases information asymmetry.

      "content": "Subscan is an essential block explorer and analytics tool for the Kusama network, providing valuable insights to the Kusama community. However, maintaining and operating Subscan requires a significant investment of resources, including server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Therefore, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fees for Subscan for the period from April to June 2024 from the Kusama treasury to ensure its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\n**Total**\n\nWe believe that this reimbursement proposal will help ensure the continuous operation and maintenance of Subscan, contributing to the growth and development of the Kusama network. We are applying for a total of $56,144.12 USD from the Kusama Treasury, which includes $41,230.47 USD for reimbursement from April to June and a $14,913.65 USD advance payment to be deducted from the reimbursement for July to September. \n\n\n**Exchange rate**\n\nThe final KSM amount will be calculated based on EMA7 at the time of official submission.\n\nhttps://kusama.subscan.io/tools/price_converter？value=56144.12&type=block&from=USD&to=KSM&time=24378073\n\n2024-08-07 10:00:12 (+UTC), Block #24378005\n\nKSM EMA7 Price ( USD ): 17.886421;\n\nNumber of KSM: 3138.924215\n\n\n**View the detailed proposal here:**\n\n**https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wEkLKR_TVTJ-WK1JttkO17TeHEzwdkXhaW3duMeOWY0/edit?usp=sharing**\n\n----\n🙏Thanks to the community's careful review and feedback, this proposal has been corrected.\n\n----\n🙏Thank you all for your understanding, support, and the constructive feedback and discussions. I'm pleased to see such a thoughtful and responsible approach to community governance, and I will do my best to respond to every feedback.\n\nWhile the costs outlined in this proposal are fully justified, as most relate to expenses incurred before June, we believe that Kusama’s unique positioning merits access to the premium resources that Subscan provides. We've consistently worked to reduce costs, but our current infrastructure is built to deliver a high-quality, well-maintained explorer rather than a basic tool. This commitment to excellence and ongoing upgrades is central to our service, and it’s not something we can easily adjust in the short term without compromising the value we bring.\n\nWe understand the concerns raised by the community, and we acknowledge the financial strain on our company due to advancing these costs under the current reimbursement model. If this proposal is not approved, it would unfortunately leave us with no choice but to immediately halt all Subscan services on the Kusama network, including the explorer, API, and related services. We would then need to resubmit the outstanding invoices until a resolution is reached.\n\nWe truly hope to continue supporting Kusama and contributing to its growth. Your support is crucial in allowing us to maintain the high standard of service that the network deserves.",

It’s clear that we are part of a community that values responsible governance, and I’m committed to addressing every concern raised.\n\nWhile the costs outlined in this proposal are fully justified, as most relate to expenses incurred before June, we believe that Kusama’s unique positioning merits access to the premium resources that Subscan provides. We've consistently worked to reduce costs, but our current infrastructure is built to deliver a high-quality, well-maintained explorer rather than a basic tool. This commitment to excellence and ongoing upgrades is central to our service, and it’s not something we can easily adjust in the short term without compromising the value we bring.\n\nWe understand the concerns raised by the community, and we acknowledge the financial strain on our company due to advancing these costs under the current reimbursement model. If this proposal is not approved, it would unfortunately leave us with no choice but to immediately halt all Subscan services on the Kusama network, including the explorer, API, and related services. We would then need to resubmit the outstanding invoices until a resolution is reached.\n\nWe truly hope to continue supporting Kusama and contributing to its growth. Your support is crucial in allowing us to maintain the high standard of service that the network deserves.",

      "content": "Proposal: College Blockchain IUR(Industry-University-Research) Cooperation  \nProponent: GoJFTV1woTYY24MJhB3bBrWLrmH1RfHBxawo4Lt24fMbrnU  \nDate: July 31, 2024  \nRequested KSM: to be completed at submission, we apply for 1911 KSM total allocation for August 2024 - October 2024 (3 month) depending on EMA(30) AVG rate (KSM = 22.29 USDT)  \n  \nShort description: Accelerate the enthusiasm of Dotsama ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers potential users to enter the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nReview of previous proposal voting processes\n\nAlthough the first two proposals were not passed, we are well aware that this is a result of the community's careful and responsible evaluation of the proposal content and the hope to do better. In the first proposal vote, we applied for a semester-long budget, because the courses we offer cannot be interrupted midway. However, based on the opinions given by the community, the second application to the treasury reduced the budget to 3 months, but our workload will not be reduced by half.\n\nDuring the second vote we had received a lot of positive feedback from the community and adjusted a lot of work content after careful consideration and received widespread recognition and support, but unfortunately the vote was maliciously sniped three times from three anonymous addresses suspected to be the same voter during the confirmation period and failed to pass. We still welcome this sniper to actively communicate with us and provide constructive feedback to help us better improve our work content, and sincerely hope that all parties can support us again.\n\nFrom the last proposal vote to this time, the 30-day moving average price of KSM has changed from $25 USDT to $22.29 USDT. So the amount applied for this proposal has changed.  \n  \nBefore you read the proposal, please see the information about us and the contracts as below：\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThere were very few participants in every Dotsama offline event in China, China is a huge market but Dotsama’s influence is not enough, so I think cooperation with universities will be a good solution, the promotion will be more efficient.\n\nProblem and Solution\n\nThe basis for the continued prosperity of the Dotsama ecosystem is a steady stream of high-quality developers. We very much agree with the educational philosophy and practical results of Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA).However, the high participation threshold and steep learning experience, especially English-taught courses, have dampened the enthusiasm of a large number of potential developers and builders. We believe that in the Chinese community, there should be an introductory course for PBA and a mechanism for a large number of undergraduate graduates to participate in the construction of Dotsama.\n\nTo this end, we will establish IUR-DAO and cooperate with six Chinese universities (more universities will be involved in the future). We offer PBA-based Chinese introduction courses in these six universities to guide potential developers and users to the Dotsama ecosystem through a combination of undergraduate graduates' learning, innovation and entrepreneurship. Briefly, we intend to carry out four main tasks in this proposal:\n\n1.  Cooperate with Six Universities on the Dotsama ecological project.\n2.  Create PBA-based Chinese introduction courses and train the university’s blockchain course instructors.\n3.  Carry out graduate project design and entrepreneurial practice or join an existing parallel chain team for internship.\n4.  Guide and recommend outstanding graduates to participate in Polkadot Hackathon.\n\nIn the future, we will make improvements based on the actual results of this project and promote it to more Chinese universities to cooperate with us.\n\nPlease see the Introduction to partner universities、budget and further informations:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nKey Results and Goals\n\nWorkscope & OKR Breakdown: August 2024 - October 2024\n\nObjective：Accelerate the enthusiasm of Dotsama ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n**Postscript : Since every September to the following January is the opening season which is the first semester in China, and the second semester is the graduation season, from February to July, our proposal workload is based on semester statistics,However, after the first application to the treasury was rejected, the community suggested changing it to three months, but our workload will not reduce by half. So the work content below is still based on semesters.**\n\n1、PBA Chinese introduction course\n\nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Completed the Chinese translation of PBA-Book.Based on the technical characteristics of Polkadot and the necessary knowledge points for developing basic applications, combined with the actual knowledge level of undergraduates, the PBA English course has been appropriately tailored.\n\n\\-Trained for CUIT instructors how to use the PBA Chinese introductory course.\n\n\\-Use the PBA Chinese introduction courses to train around 900 undergraduate students in each university\n\n\\-The recorded live streams will be uploaded to YouTube channel.\n\n\\-Select highlights from the live streams will also be transcribed into text and published as articles.\n\n2、Cooperation framework with universities\n\nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Sign cooperation agreements with more universities.\n\n\\-Developed an innovation and entrepreneurship Dotsama training plan for over 3000 students.\n\n-   Innovative training project: Undergraduate students individually or in teams, under the guidance of instructors, independently complete the design of polkadot innovative experimental methods and write summary reports, etc. The innovation training project advocates the application of projects based on practical problem research combined with the needs of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry, and is encouraged to be combined with undergraduate graduation thesis (design).\n-   Parachain training project: Under the guidance of school instructors, each student plays one or more specific roles in the project implementation process. By conducting feasibility studies, preparing parachain plans, and simulating operations, Carry out a certain level of coding, write entrepreneurial reports, etc.\n-   Entrepreneurship practice project: Under the joint guidance of school mentors and business mentors, student teams use the results of previous innovation and entrepreneurship training projects to propose an innovative product or service with market prospects, and carry out entrepreneurial practice activities based on this. -Distributing all contents across more than 3 largest blockchain media or communities outlets in China.\n\n3、Educational Contents Production\n\nOKR for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Select 100 outstanding papers from 1000 undergraduate graduation papers and publish them in no less than 5 mainstream blockchain media or communities in China.The total number of delivery times is not less than 100\\*5.\n\n\\-Topics other than outstanding papers include introducing infrastructure projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, parachains,helping the community understand ecological diversity and the experiences during the learning process.\n\n\\-Design and produce a graduation certificate in the form of NFT.\n\n4、User metrics\n\nOKR for the user growth goal we want to achieve based on the above three work results:\n\n\\-Target users: more than 3000 users to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n\\-Potential builders: more than 50.\n\n\\-marketing means:\n\n-   Publish a Dotsama-related article every month to attract users to follow the Wechat official account.\n-   Host 1 online/offline activities once a month and transfer the user from the broadcast room to the Wechat official account. I\n-   nclude a follow method at the end of all our videos.\n-   Occasionally release our own custom-designed Dotsama swags to attract users to follow and share articles to increase article views.\n-   Each month, we collaborate with one ecosystem project to launch small user growth activities, such as DeFi liquidity provision, staking, gift giveaways, and airdrops. These are specifically designed events that require close coordination with the eco teams.\n\n5、Reporting\n\nIUR-DAO will focus on the Polkadot technical education in China assisting the Dotsama Community to expand the impact and cooperate with potential projects to help them build the dApp on Polkadot. We will publish a Monthly Review and Report on Polkassembly on the last day of every month, including performance data and all activities and materials created, to be shared with the Direction channel and comments on our original proposals for regular updates.\n\nWhy us？\n\nWe are one of the first domestic units engaged in improving professional skills in the digital economy under the general outline of the \"Digital China Development Plan\". The founding team was invited to participate in China's second global blockchain industry conference in 2016. Summit Forum, in 2018, it cooperated with the first batch of blockchain universities in China, such as Tsinghua University, China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shenzhen University, etc., and was inspected by national leaders. At the end of 2020, in accordance with the national vocational education policy and combined with the requirements of industry, market and enterprise development, the unit recommended that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security establish a new profession of blockchain operator and was approved. At the same time, it participated in the formulation of the \"National Vocational Skills Standards for Blockchain Application Operators (2021 Edition)\" and is the only professional skill level certification organization for blockchain application operators in Zhejiang Province. Certification work such as \"Blockchain Application Operator\", \"Digital Twin Application Technician\" and \"Digital Solution Designer\" can be carried out within Zhejiang.In April 2023, the first batch of \"AIGC Application Engineer\" and \"Prompt Engineer\" courses in the country was opened providing teaching services: courses and training systems, multimedia teaching systems.\n\nWe rely on the digital economy industry venture capital fund to cultivate talents and industrial investment and incubation action paths, fully tap the needs of local industry improvement and momentum conversion, and support the development of major Internet companies and emerging industries through talent cultivation and industry It combines development with smart technology and digital-real linkage and conversion with local industries to achieve social significance such as digital economic transformation and regional economic growth.\n\nFor specific information about the further information about this project, please send us an email for consultation.Email address: iur.pro@protonmail.com.",

In the first proposal vote, we applied for a semester-long budget, because the courses we offer cannot be interrupted midway. However, based on the opinions given by the community, the second application to the treasury reduced the budget to 3 months, but our workload will not be reduced by half.\n\nDuring the second vote we had received a lot of positive feedback from the community and adjusted a lot of work content after careful consideration and received widespread recognition and support, but unfortunately the vote was maliciously sniped three times from three anonymous addresses suspected to be the same voter during the confirmation period and failed to pass. We still welcome this sniper to actively communicate with us and provide constructive feedback to help us better improve our work content, and sincerely hope that all parties can support us again.\n\nFrom the last proposal vote to this time, the 30-day moving average price of KSM has changed from $25 USDT to $22.29 USDT. So the amount applied for this proposal has changed.  \n  \nBefore you read the proposal, please see the information about us and the contracts as below：\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThere were very few participants in every Dotsama offline event in China, China is a huge market but Dotsama’s influence is not enough, so I think cooperation with universities will be a good solution, the promotion will be more efficient.\n\nProblem and Solution\n\nThe basis for the continued prosperity of the Dotsama ecosystem is a steady stream of high-quality developers. We very much agree with the educational philosophy and practical results of Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA).However, the high participation threshold and steep learning experience, especially English-taught courses, have dampened the enthusiasm of a large number of potential developers and builders. We believe that in the Chinese community, there should be an introductory course for PBA and a mechanism for a large number of undergraduate graduates to participate in the construction of Dotsama.\n\nTo this end, we will establish IUR-DAO and cooperate with six Chinese universities (more universities will be involved in the future). We offer PBA-based Chinese introduction courses in these six universities to guide potential developers and users to the Dotsama ecosystem through a combination of undergraduate graduates' learning, innovation and entrepreneurship. Briefly, we intend to carry out four main tasks in this proposal:\n\n1.  Cooperate with Six Universities on the Dotsama ecological project.\n2.  Create PBA-based Chinese introduction courses and train the university’s blockchain course instructors.\n3.  Carry out graduate project design and entrepreneurial practice or join an existing parallel chain team for internship.\n4.  Guide and recommend outstanding graduates to participate in Polkadot Hackathon.\n\nIn the future, we will make improvements based on the actual results of this project and promote it to more Chinese universities to cooperate with us.\n\nPlease see the Introduction to partner universities、budget and further informations:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nKey Results and Goals\n\nWorkscope & OKR Breakdown: August 2024 - October 2024\n\nObjective：Accelerate the enthusiasm of Dotsama ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n**Postscript : Since every September to the following January is the opening season which is the first semester in China, and the second semester is the graduation season, from February to July, our proposal workload is based on semester statistics,However, after the first application to the treasury was rejected, the community suggested changing it to three months, so the work content below is still based on semesters.**\n\n1、PBA Chinese introduction course\n\nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Completed the Chinese translation of PBA-Book.Based on the technical characteristics of Polkadot and the necessary knowledge points for developing basic applications, combined with the actual knowledge level of undergraduates, the PBA English course has been appropriately tailored.\n\n\\-Trained for CUIT instructors how to use the PBA Chinese introductory course.\n\n\\-Use the PBA Chinese introduction courses to train around 900 undergraduate students in each university\n\n\\-The recorded live streams will be uploaded to YouTube channel.\n\n\\-Select highlights from the live streams will also be transcribed into text and published as articles.\n\n2、Cooperation framework with universities\n\nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Sign cooperation agreements with more universities.\n\n\\-Developed an innovation and entrepreneurship Dotsama training plan for over 3000 students.\n\n-   Innovative training project: Undergraduate students individually or in teams, under the guidance of instructors, independently complete the design of polkadot innovative experimental methods and write summary reports, etc. The innovation training project advocates the application of projects based on practical problem research combined with the needs of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry, and is encouraged to be combined with undergraduate graduation thesis (design).\n-   Parachain training project: Under the guidance of school instructors, each student plays one or more specific roles in the project implementation process. By conducting feasibility studies, preparing parachain plans, and simulating operations, Carry out a certain level of coding, write entrepreneurial reports, etc.\n-   Entrepreneurship practice project: Under the joint guidance of school mentors and business mentors, student teams use the results of previous innovation and entrepreneurship training projects to propose an innovative product or service with market prospects, and carry out entrepreneurial practice activities based on this. -Distributing all contents across more than 3 largest blockchain media or communities outlets in China.\n\n3、Educational Contents Production\n\nOKR for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Select 100 outstanding papers from 1000 undergraduate graduation papers and publish them in no less than 5 mainstream blockchain media or communities in China.The total number of delivery times is not less than 100\\*5.\n\n\\-Topics other than outstanding papers include introducing infrastructure projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, parachains,helping the community understand ecological diversity and the experiences during the learning process.\n\n\\-Design and produce a graduation certificate in the form of NFT.\n\n4、User metrics\n\nOKR for the user growth goal we want to achieve based on the above three work results:\n\n\\-Target users: more than 3000 users to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n\\-Potential builders: more than 50.\n\n\\-marketing means:\n\n-   Publish a Dotsama-related article every month to attract users to follow the Wechat official account.\n-   Host 1 online/offline activities once a month and transfer the user from the broadcast room to the Wechat official account.

In the first proposal vote, we applied for a semester-long budget, because the courses we offer cannot be interrupted midway. However, based on the opinions given by the community, the second application to the treasury reduced the budget to 3 months, but our workload will not be reduced by half.\n\nDuring the second vote we had received a lot of positive feedback from the community and adjusted a lot of work content after careful consideration and received widespread recognition and support, but unfortunately the vote was maliciously sniped three times from three anonymous addresses suspected to be the same voter during the confirmation period and failed to pass. We still welcome this sniper to actively communicate with us and provide constructive feedback to help us better improve our work content, and sincerely hope that all parties can support us again.\n\nFrom the last proposal vote to this time, the 30-day moving average price of KSM has changed from $25 USDT to $22.29 USDT. So the amount applied for this proposal has changed.  \n  \n  \n\nBefore you read the proposal, please see the information about us and the contracts as below：\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThere were very few participants in every Dotsama offline event in China, China is a huge market but Dotsama’s influence is not enough, so I think cooperation with universities will be a good solution, the promotion will be more efficient.\n\nProblem and Solution\n\nThe basis for the continued prosperity of the Dotsama ecosystem is a steady stream of high-quality developers. We very much agree with the educational philosophy and practical results of Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA).However, the high participation threshold and steep learning experience, especially English-taught courses, have dampened the enthusiasm of a large number of potential developers and builders. We believe that in the Chinese community, there should be an introductory course for PBA and a mechanism for a large number of undergraduate graduates to participate in the construction of Dotsama.\n\nTo this end, we will establish IUR-DAO and cooperate with six Chinese universities (more universities will be involved in the future). We offer PBA-based Chinese introduction courses in these six universities to guide potential developers and users to the Dotsama ecosystem through a combination of undergraduate graduates' learning, innovation and entrepreneurship. Briefly, we intend to carry out four main tasks in this proposal:\n\nCooperate with Six Universities on the Dotsama ecological project. Create PBA-based Chinese introduction courses and train the university’s blockchain course instructors. Carry out graduate project design and entrepreneurial practice or join an existing parallel chain team for internship. Guide and recommend outstanding graduates to participate in Polkadot Hackathon. In the future, we will make improvements based on the actual results of this project and promote it to more Chinese universities to cooperate with us.\n\nPlease see the Introduction to partner universities、budget and further informations:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nKey Results and Goals\n\nWorkscope & OKR Breakdown: August 2024 - October 2024\n\nObjective：Accelerate the enthusiasm of Dotsama ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\nPostscript : Since every September to the following January is the opening season which is the first semester in China, and the second semester is the graduation season, from February to July, our proposal workload is based on semester statistics,However, after the first application to the treasury was rejected, the community suggested changing it to three months, so the work content below is still based on semesters.\n\n1、PBA Chinese introduction course\n\nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Completed the Chinese translation of PBA-Book.Based on the technical characteristics of Polkadot and the necessary knowledge points for developing basic applications, combined with the actual knowledge level of undergraduates, the PBA English course has been appropriately tailored.\n\n\\-Trained for CUIT instructors how to use the PBA Chinese introductory course.\n\n\\-Use the PBA Chinese introduction courses to train around 900 undergraduate students in each university\n\n\\-The recorded live streams will be uploaded to YouTube channel.\n\n\\-Select highlights from the live streams will also be transcribed into text and published as articles.\n\n2、Cooperation framework with universities\n\nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Sign cooperation agreements with more universities.\n\n\\-Developed an innovation and entrepreneurship Dotsama training plan for over 3000 students.\n\n-   Innovative training project: Undergraduate students individually or in teams, under the guidance of instructors, independently complete the design of polkadot innovative experimental methods and write summary reports, etc. The innovation training project advocates the application of projects based on practical problem research combined with the needs of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry, and is encouraged to be combined with undergraduate graduation thesis (design).\n-   Parachain training project: Under the guidance of school instructors, each student plays one or more specific roles in the project implementation process. By conducting feasibility studies, preparing parachain plans, and simulating operations, Carry out a certain level of coding, write entrepreneurial reports, etc.\n-   Entrepreneurship practice project: Under the joint guidance of school mentors and business mentors, student teams use the results of previous innovation and entrepreneurship training projects to propose an innovative product or service with market prospects, and carry out entrepreneurial practice activities based on this. -Distributing all contents across more than 3 largest blockchain media or communities outlets in China.\n\n3、Educational Contents Production\n\nOKR for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n\\-Select 100 outstanding papers from 1000 undergraduate graduation papers and publish them in no less than 5 mainstream blockchain media or communities in China.The total number of delivery times is not less than 100\\*5.\n\n\\-Topics other than outstanding papers include introducing infrastructure projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, parachains,helping the community understand ecological diversity and the experiences during the learning process.\n\n\\-Design and produce a graduation certificate in the form of NFT.\n\n4、User metrics\n\nOKR for the user growth goal we want to achieve based on the above three work results:\n\n\\-Target users: more than 3000 users to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n\\-Potential builders: more than 50.\n\n\\-marketing means:\n\n-   Publish a Dotsama-related article every month to attract users to follow the Wechat official account.\n-   Host 1 online/offline activities once a month and transfer the user from the broadcast room to the Wechat official account. I\n-   nclude a follow method at the end of all our videos.\n-   Occasionally release our own custom-designed Dotsama swags to attract users to follow and share articles to increase article views.\n-   Each month, we collaborate with one ecosystem project to launch small user growth activities, such as DeFi liquidity provision, staking, gift giveaways, and airdrops. These are specifically designed events that require close coordination with the eco teams.\n\n  \n5、Reporting\n\nIUR-DAO will focus on the Polkadot technical education in China assisting the Dotsama Community to expand the impact and cooperate with potential projects to help them build the dApp on Polkadot. We will publish a Monthly Review and Report on Polkassembly on the last day of every month, including performance data and all activities and materials created, to be shared with the Direction channel and comments on our original proposals for regular updates.\n\nWhy us？\n\nWe are one of the first domestic units engaged in improving professional skills in the digital economy under the general outline of the \"Digital China Development Plan\". The founding team was invited to participate in China's second global blockchain industry conference in 2016. Summit Forum, in 2018, it cooperated with the first batch of blockchain universities in China, such as Tsinghua University, China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shenzhen University, etc., and was inspected by national leaders. At the end of 2020, in accordance with the national vocational education policy and combined with the requirements of industry, market and enterprise development, the unit recommended that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security establish a new profession of blockchain operator and was approved. At the same time, it participated in the formulation of the \"National Vocational Skills Standards for Blockchain Application Operators (2021 Edition)\" and is the only professional skill level certification organization for blockchain application operators in Zhejiang Province. Certification work such as \"Blockchain Application Operator\", \"Digital Twin Application Technician\" and \"Digital Solution Designer\" can be carried out within Zhejiang.In April 2023, the first batch of \"AIGC Application Engineer\" and \"Prompt Engineer\" courses in the country was opened providing teaching services: courses and training systems, multimedia teaching systems.\n\nWe rely on the digital economy industry venture capital fund to cultivate talents and industrial investment and incubation action paths, fully tap the needs of local industry improvement and momentum conversion, and support the development of major Internet companies and emerging industries through talent cultivation and industry It combines development with smart technology and digital-real linkage and conversion with local industries to achieve social significance such as digital economic transformation and regional economic growth.\n\nFor specific information about the further information about this project, please send us an email for consultation.Email address: iur.pro@protonmail.com.",

We propose to reassign us as the curator, so we can finish our work.\n\nAchievements since [last top up proposal](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/215):\n- Refactor vesting scan.\n- Extract assets pallet scan and fix bugs.\n- Add a package to scan recovery pallet business.\n- Support proxy pallet scan.\n- Create a graphql server to serve most business data including identity, multisig, recovery, proxy and vesting.\n- Developed new fronted pages for vesting, recovery.\n- Refactor fronted pages of assets to adapt new graphql API.\n\nFailures:\n\n- We failed to bring more developers by child bounties. The main reason is that a child bounty collaboration is very time consuming even after collaborations with my team. It may take monthes for a candidate to finish the job which can be done by OpenSquare under 1 or 2 weeks.\n\nPlan: as we finished [proxy scan](https://github.com/opensquare-network/statescan-v2/pull/922) recently, implementing proxy related UIs is our next work plan.",

Each tool can be installed independently.\n\n- [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Core component for API, Router and Visualizator. Meant to unify the cross-chain experience on Polkadot and become a layer 2 protocol that allows for seamless integration of XCM into your dApps. XCM SDK groups all 54 integrated XCM-compatible Parachain XCM Pallets into one uniform package and allows you to generate cross-chain calls with just one line.\n- [XCM Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router): (SpellRouter☄️): Meant to allow you to create XCM calls where you receive different assets than assets you send (Eg. Send -> DOT from Polkadot, receive ASTR on Astar)—all in just one call.\n- [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api): (LightSpell⚡️): Meant to ease the integration of XCM interoperability into your dApp, offload your dApp from heavy computing and save you costs. LightSpell implements XCM SDK and XCM Router into simple API endpoints.\n- [XCM Analyser](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser): Tool to convert XCM Multilocations to human-readable format. Written in emphasis on minimalistic dependency list.\n- [XCM Visualizator](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe): Tool to visualize XCM in the Polkadot ecosystem. Browse through history, explore selected Parachains, filter accounts engaging in XCM the most and more all in exciting 3D universe-like visualization.\n\n## The core and the only XCM SDK you will ever need\nCreated, when there were no other SDKs for XCM in the ecosystem. At the sole beginning of Polkadot. Born from a wild idea, to unify the XCM experience in the ecosystem. Meet our battle-hardened and well-established [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk).\n[![sdk](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/4348e5e4-b4cc-4205-a890-41efc6cfac15)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\n### The abilities you gain by using XCM SDK:\n- Ability to transfer XCM messages from/to 54 different XCM compatible Parachains (Number of compatible chains fluctuates as some of them are added/removed)\n- Support for all three XCM transfer scenarios (UMP - Para to Relay, DMP - Relay to Para, HRMP - Para to Para)\n- Support for multi-asset transfers and fully customizable multi-locations (for destination chains, accounts and currencies)\n- Customizable XCM version (If our preselected version stops working, you can select one that works with just one simple parameter)\n- Asset claim feature with reduced parameters (Only 3 parameters required - chain, amount and address)\n- Polkadot <> Kusama bridge implemented for both DOT & KSM transfers\n- Testing on testnet or localhost (You can input custom WS port parameter or even custom Parachain ID)\n- Useful [transfer info queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/xcmPallet.html#xcm-transfer-info) (Query fees, expected delivery amount and other transfer-related info all in just one query)\n- Front-end related data queries - useful [asset queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/AssetPallet.html), [XCM pallet queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/NodePallets.html), [existential deposit queries](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/sdk/xcmPallet.html#query-existential-deposit) and more!\n- Ability to use a keep-alive kind of XCM transfer which checks the balance of the account on the destination chain and determines if the amount you send is sufficient.\n\n**XCM SDK has since the last 9 months of maintenance had a total of 23506 downloads on NPMJS**\n\n## Sending one asset cross-chain and receiving another was never this easy\nMeet our latest state-of-the-art technology called [XCM-Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router). It is easy to implement and has plenty of awesome features like automatic exchange chain selection! Featuring **524** asset exchange pools makes it the largest liquidity routing tool in the Polkadot.

Dušan continues to study for a Doctoral degree (To be able to continue research passion and release more research papers for Polkadot and ParaSpell).\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\nThe proposal aims to aid server costs and maintenance for the 🥇 first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/xcm-api) and [XCM Visualizator](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/visualizator-fe) in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Maintaining XCM API, [XCM ROUTER](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-router) and XCM Visualizator also include maintaining its core component - [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk). These common good tools along with [XCM Analyser](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/packages/xcm-analyser), [XCM Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/playground), [Documentation](https://github.com/paraspell/docs) and [Landing page](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-tools/tree/main/apps/landing-page) will be fully maintained for the mentioned period starting on 1st August 2024 and ending on 1st February 2025. This proposal allows all tools to remain completely free for the entire Polkadot and Kusama communities. It also allows our team to dedicate time to help other teams that wish to implement our tools.\n\n### What are you getting by implementing one of our tools or more\n- Complex free support with implementation (Through a private telegram group between our and your team (We usually respond within minutes and we are also open to live calls when time plays a role in your project delivery - form to reach out to us can be found on our [Landing page](https://lightspell.xyz/)))\n- Prompt issue solving if any occurs (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n- Constant updates for every package (We strive to bring new features for each tool)\n- Comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) for each tool\n- Reliability (Checked each month for changes in Pallets or compatible Parachains)\n- **Guarantee, that everything is free for everyone. The ParaSpell✨ team aims to deliver only the common good, be completely open-source and free with no hidden costs or subscriptions.**\n\n### What are you getting as a non-developer/dApp user by supporting this proposal\n- Our products allow dApps to be created much faster, so you can enjoy their benefits quicker.\n- You can be sure, that dApp implementing our tool is safe for XCM as our tools are thoroughly tested and regularly updated. There are multiple ways to lose assets cross-chain.\n- You too can try our products via the [Playground](https://playground.paraspell.xyz/).\n- We have been in the ecosystem for a while now and we are hardcore ecosystem fans. We will continue maintaining the tools even if we are short of funding (Just at a slower pace). So you do not have to deal with your dApp suddenly disabling your favourite feature. This is because we primarily build and maintain these tools to make life easier for everyone - not for profits (There is no business model or hidden fees in any of our tools. They are purely common good).\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n- Discussion: 1. July. 2024 - 8. July. 2024\n- Voting: 9. July. 2024 - 22. July. 2024\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Proposal ask\nThe proposal seeks 48.000$ worth of funding for 6 months of various maintenance tasks and assistance to other teams. This is divided into 8.000$ per month and 25$ per developer work hour.

      "content": "**Proposal: College Blockchain IUR(Industry-University-Research) Cooperation**\n\n**Proponent:** GoJFTV1woTYY24MJhB3bBrWLrmH1RfHBxawo4Lt24fMbrnU\n\n**Date:** July 5, 2024\n\n**Requested KSM**: to be completed at submission, we apply for 1704 KSM total allocation for August 2024 - October 2024（3 month） depending on EMA(30) AVG rate（ KSM = 25 USDT）\n\n**Short description:** Accelerate the enthusiasm of Dotsama ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers potential users to enter the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n**Before you read the proposal, please see the information about us and the contracts as below：**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rjOjTYholcG0HdLnnNFRRRHjk2ilErUzL6qrY6wUgOI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThere were very few participants in every Dotsama offline event in China, China is a huge market but Dotsama’s influence is not enough, so I think cooperation with universities will be a good solution, the promotion will be more efficient.\n\n**Problem and Solution**\n\nThe basis for the continued prosperity of the Dotsama ecosystem is a steady stream of high-quality developers. We very much agree with the educational philosophy and practical results of Polkadot Blockchain Academy (PBA).However, the high participation threshold and steep learning experience, especially English-taught courses, have dampened the enthusiasm of a large number of potential developers and builders. We believe that in the Chinese community, there should be an introductory course for PBA and a mechanism for a large number of undergraduate graduates to participate in the construction of Dotsama.\n\nTo this end, we will establish IUR-DAO and cooperate with six Chinese universities (more universities will be involved in the future). We offer PBA-based Chinese introduction courses in these six universities to guide potential developers and users to the Dotsama ecosystem through a combination of undergraduate graduates' learning, innovation and entrepreneurship. Briefly, we intend to carry out four main tasks in this proposal:\n\n1.  Cooperate with Six Universities on the Dotsama ecological project.\n2.  Create PBA-based Chinese introduction courses and train the university’s blockchain course instructors.\n3.  Carry out graduate project design and entrepreneurial practice or join an existing parallel chain team for internship.\n4.  Guide and recommend outstanding graduates to participate in Polkadot Hackathon.\n\nIn the future, we will make improvements based on the actual results of this project and promote it to more Chinese universities to cooperate with us.\n\n**Please see the Introduction to partner universities、budget and further informations:**\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19b1YnfxyFYTryvRU4VWt6fygRqGuFdw4eohlIefCHmo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Key Results and Goals**\n\nWorkscope & OKR Breakdown: August 2024 - October 2024\n\nObjective：Accelerate the enthusiasm of Dotsama ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\nPostscript : Since every September to the following January is the opening season which is the first semester in China, and the second semester is the graduation season, from February to July, our proposal workload is based on semester statistics,However, after the first application to the treasury was rejected, the community suggested changing it to three months, so the work content below is still based on semesters.\n\n**1、PBA Chinese introduction course**\n\n**OKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:**\n\n\\-Completed the Chinese translation of PBA-Book.Based on the technical characteristics of Polkadot and the necessary knowledge points for developing basic applications, combined with the actual knowledge level of undergraduates, the PBA English course has been appropriately tailored.\n\n\\-Trained for CUIT instructors how to use the PBA Chinese introductory course.\n\n\\-Use the PBA Chinese introduction courses to train around 900 undergraduate students in each university\n\n\\-The recorded live streams will be uploaded to YouTube channel.\n\n\\-Select highlights from the live streams will also be transcribed into text and published as articles.\n\n**2、Cooperation framework with universities**\n\n**OKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:**\n\n\\-Sign cooperation agreements with more universities.\n\n\\-Developed an innovation and entrepreneurship Dotsama training plan for over 3000 students.\n\n1.  Innovative training project: Undergraduate students individually or in teams, under the guidance of instructors, independently complete the design of polkadot innovative experimental methods and write summary reports, etc. The innovation training project advocates the application of projects based on practical problem research combined with the needs of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry, and is encouraged to be combined with undergraduate graduation thesis (design).\n2.  Parachain training project: Under the guidance of school instructors, each student plays one or more specific roles in the project implementation process. By conducting feasibility studies, preparing parachain plans, and simulating operations, Carry out a certain level of coding, write entrepreneurial reports, etc.\n3.  Entrepreneurship practice project: Under the joint guidance of school mentors and business mentors, student teams use the results of previous innovation and entrepreneurship training projects to propose an innovative product or service with market prospects, and carry out entrepreneurial practice activities based on this.\n\n\\-Distributing all contents across more than 3 largest blockchain media or communities outlets in China.\n\n**3、Educational Contents Production**\n\n**OKR for the 6 months period of this proposal:**\n\n\\-Select 100 outstanding papers from 1000 undergraduate graduation papers and publish them in no less than 5 mainstream blockchain media or communities in China.The total number of delivery times is not less than 100\\*5.\n\n\\-Topics other than outstanding papers include introducing infrastructure projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, parachains,helping the community understand ecological diversity and the experiences during the learning process.\n\n\\-Design and produce a graduation certificate in the form of NFT.\n\n**4、User metrics**\n\n**OKR for the user growth goal we want to achieve based on the above three work results:**\n\n\\-Target users: more than 3000 users to enter the Dotsama ecosystem.\n\n\\-Potential builders: more than 50.\n\n\\-marketing means:\n\n-   Publish a Dotsama-related article every month to attract users to follow the Wechat official account.\n-   Host 1 online/offline activities once a month and transfer the user from the broadcast room to the Wechat official account.\n-   Include a follow method at the end of all our videos.\n-   Occasionally release our own custom-designed Dotsama swags to attract users to follow and share articles to increase article views.\n-   Each month, we collaborate with one ecosystem project to launch small user growth activities, such as DeFi liquidity provision, staking, gift giveaways, and airdrops. These are specifically designed events that require close coordination with the eco teams.\n\n**5、Reporting**\n\nIUR-DAO will focus on the Polkadot technical education in China assisting the Dotsama Community to expand the impact and cooperate with potential projects to help them build the dApp on Polkadot. We will publish a Monthly Review and Report on Polkassembly on the last day of every month, including performance data and all activities and materials created, to be shared with the Direction channel and comments on our original proposals for regular updates.\n\n**Why us？**\n\nWe are one of the first domestic units engaged in improving professional skills in the digital economy under the general outline of the \"Digital China Development Plan\". The founding team was invited to participate in China's second global blockchain industry conference in 2016. Summit Forum, in 2018, it cooperated with the first batch of blockchain universities in China, such as Tsinghua University, China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shenzhen University, etc., and was inspected by national leaders. At the end of 2020, in accordance with the national vocational education policy and combined with the requirements of industry, market and enterprise development, the unit recommended that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security establish a new profession of blockchain operator and was approved. At the same time, it participated in the formulation of the \"National Vocational Skills Standards for Blockchain Application Operators (2021 Edition)\" and is the only professional skill level certification organization for blockchain application operators in Zhejiang Province. Certification work such as \"Blockchain Application Operator\", \"Digital Twin Application Technician\" and \"Digital Solution Designer\" can be carried out within Zhejiang.In April 2023, the first batch of \"AIGC Application Engineer\" and \"Prompt Engineer\" courses in the country was opened providing teaching services: courses and training systems, multimedia teaching systems.\n\nWe rely on the digital economy industry venture capital fund to cultivate talents and industrial investment and incubation action paths, fully tap the needs of local industry improvement and momentum conversion, and support the development of major Internet companies and emerging industries through talent cultivation and industry It combines development with smart technology and digital-real linkage and conversion with local industries to achieve social significance such as digital economic transformation and regional economic growth.\n\nFor specific information about the further information about this project, please send us an email for consultation.Email address: iur.pro@protonmail.com.",

We very much agree with the educational philosophy and practical results of Polkadot/Kusama Blockchain Academy (PBA).However, the high participation threshold and steep learning experience, especially English-taught courses, have dampened the enthusiasm of a large number of potential developers and builders. We believe that in the Chinese community, there should be an introductory course for PBA and a mechanism for a large number of undergraduate graduates to participate in the construction of Polkadot/Kusama. \n\nTo this end, we will establish IUR-DAO and cooperate with six Chinese universities （more universities will be involved in the future）to guide potential developers to the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem through a combination of undergraduate graduates' learning, innovation and entrepreneurship. Briefly, we intend to carry out four main tasks in this proposal:\n\n1.  Cooperate with there Universities on the Polkadot/Kusama ecological project.\n2.  Create PBA Chinese introduction courses and train the university’s blockchain course instructors.\n3.  Carry out graduate project design and entrepreneurial practice or join an existing parallel chain team for internship.\n4.  Guide and recommend outstanding graduates to participate in Polkadot Hackathon.\n\nIn the future, we will make improvements based on the actual results of this project and promote it to more Chinese universities to cooperate with us.\n\nPlease see the Introduction to partner universities and further information:  \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCWrrKlcwwIy2mU-Zdv3egDHVj-0SjsDhpCSW8fWTGg/edit#heading=h.ofb88j3x9b0d](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCWrrKlcwwIy2mU-Zdv3egDHVj-0SjsDhpCSW8fWTGg/edit#heading=h.ofb88j3x9b0d)  \n  \n**Key Results and Goals**  \nWorkscope & OKR Breakdown: August 2024 - January 2024  \nObjective：Accelerate the enthusiasm of Polkadot ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers to enter the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.  \n  \n**1\\. PBA Chinese introductory course**  \nOKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:  \n  \n\\- Completed the Chinese translation of PBA-Book.Based on the technical characteristics of Polkadot and the necessary knowledge points for developing basic applications, combined with the actual knowledge level of undergraduates, the PBA English course has been appropriately tailored.  \n\\- Trained for CUIT instructors how to use the PBA Chinese introductory course.  \n\\- Use the PBA Chinese introduction course to train 900 undergraduate students across the college.  \n\\- All recorded live streams will be uploaded to YouTube channel.  \n\\- Select highlights from the live streams will also be transcribed into text and published as articles.\n\n**2.Cooperation framework with universities  \n**OKRs for the 6 months period of this proposal:  \n  \n\\- Sign a cooperation agreement with these universities.\n\n-   Developed an innovation and entrepreneurship Polkadot/Kusama training plan for over 3000 students.  \n      \n    a. Innovative training project: Undergraduate students individually or in teams, under the guidance of instructors, independently complete the design of polkadot/Kusama innovative experimental methods and write summary reports, etc. The innovation training project advocates the application of projects based on practical problem research combined with the needs of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry, and is encouraged to be combined with undergraduate graduation thesis (design).  \n      \n    b. Parachain training project: Under the guidance of school instructors, each student plays one or more specific roles in the project implementation process. By conducting feasibility studies, preparing parachain plans, and simulating operations, Carry out a certain level of coding, write entrepreneurial reports, etc.  \n      \n    c. Entrepreneurship practice project: Under the joint guidance of school mentors and business mentors, student teams use the results of previous innovation and entrepreneurship training projects to propose an innovative product or service with market prospects, and carry out entrepreneurial practice activities based on this.  \n      \n    \\- Distributing all contents across more than 3 largest blockchain media or communities outlets in China.\n\n**3\\. Educational Contents Production**  \nOKR for the 6 months period of this proposal:\n\n-   Select 100 outstanding papers from 1000 undergraduate graduation papers and publish them in no less than 5 mainstream blockchain media or communities in China.The total number of delivery times is not less than 100\\*5.\n-   Topics other than outstanding papers include introducing infrastructure projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, parachains,helping the community understand ecological diversity and the experiences during the learning process.\n-   Design and produce a graduation certificate in the form of NFT.\n\n**4\\. User metrics  \n**OKR for the user growth goal we want to achieve based on the above three work results:\n\n-   Target users: more than 3000 users to enter the polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.\n-   Potential builders: more than 50.\n-   marketing means:  \n    1\\. Publish a Polkadot/Kusama-related article every month to attract users to follow the Wechat official account.  \n    2\\. Host 1 online/offline activities once a month and transfer the user from the broadcast room to the Wechat official account.  \n    3\\. Include a follow method at the end of all our videos.  \n    4\\. Occasionally release our own custom-designed Polkadot swags to attract users to follow and share articles to increase article views.  \n    5\\. Each month, we collaborate with one ecosystem project to launch small user growth activities, such as DeFi liquidity provision, staking, gift giveaways, and airdrops. These are specifically designed events that require close coordination with the eco teams.\n\n**5\\. Reporting**  \nIUR-DAO will focus on the Polkadot/Kusama technical education in China assisting the Polkadot/Kusama Community to expand the impact and cooperate with potential projects to help them build the dApp on Polkadot/Kusama. We will publish a Monthly Review and Report on Polkassembly on the last day of every month, including performance data and all activities and materials created, to be shared with the Direction channel and comments on our original proposals for regular updates.  \n  \n\nBased on the budget in the above table, we apply for USD 14,100 per month, which is USD 84,600 in total (from August 2024 to January 2025).  \n  \n\n**Why us**  \nWe are one of the first domestic units engaged in improving professional skills in the digital economy under the general outline of the \"Digital China Development Plan\". The founding team was invited to participate in China's second global blockchain industry conference in 2016. Summit Forum, in 2018, it cooperated with the first batch of blockchain universities in China, such as Tsinghua University, China University of Political Science and Law, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shenzhen University, etc., and was inspected by national leaders. At the end of 2020, in accordance with the national vocational education policy and combined with the requirements of industry, market and enterprise development, the unit recommended that the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security establish a new profession of blockchain operator and was approved. At the same time, it participated in the formulation of the \"National Vocational Skills Standards for Blockchain Application Operators (2021 Edition)\" and is the only professional skill level certification organization for blockchain application operators in Zhejiang Province. Certification work such as \"Blockchain Application Operator\", \"Digital Twin Application Technician\" and \"Digital Solution Designer\" can be carried out within Zhejiang.In April 2023, the first batch of \"AIGC Application Engineer\" and \"Prompt Engineer\" courses in the country was opened providing teaching services: courses and training systems, multimedia teaching systems.\n\nWe rely on the digital economy industry venture capital fund to cultivate talents and industrial investment and incubation action paths, fully tap the needs of local industry improvement and momentum conversion, and support the development of major Internet companies and emerging industries through talent cultivation and industry It combines development with smart technology and digital-real linkage and conversion with local industries to achieve social significance such as digital economic transformation and regional economic growth.\n\nFor specific information about the further information about this project, please send us an email for consultation.Email address: iur.pro@protonmail.com.",

We very much agree with the educational philosophy and practical results of Polkadot/Kusama Blockchain Academy (PBA).However, the high participation threshold and steep learning experience, especially English-taught courses, have dampened the enthusiasm of a large number of potential developers and builders. We believe that in the Chinese community, there should be an introductory course for PBA and a mechanism for a large number of undergraduate graduates to participate in the construction of Polkadot/Kusama.\n\nTo this end, we will establish IUR-DAO and cooperate with six Chinese universities （more universities will be involved in the future）to guide potential developers to the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem through a combination of undergraduate graduates' learning, innovation and entrepreneurship. Briefly, we intend to carry out four main tasks in this proposal:\n\n1.  Cooperate with there Universities on the Polkadot/Kusama ecological project.\n2.  Create PBA Chinese introduction courses and train the university’s blockchain course instructors.\n3.  Carry out graduate project design and entrepreneurial practice or join an existing parallel chain team for internship.\n4.  Guide and recommend outstanding graduates to participate in Polkadot Hackathon.\n\nIn the future, we will make improvements based on the actual results of this project and promote it to more Chinese universities to cooperate with us.\n\nPlease see the Introduction to partner universities and further information:  \n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCWrrKlcwwIy2mU-Zdv3egDHVj-0SjsDhpCSW8fWTGg/edit#heading=h.ofb88j3x9b0d](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QCWrrKlcwwIy2mU-Zdv3egDHVj-0SjsDhpCSW8fWTGg/edit#heading=h.ofb88j3x9b0d)  \n  \n**Key Results and Goals**  \nWorkscope & OKR Breakdown: August 2024 - January 2024  \nObjective：Accelerate the enthusiasm of Polkadot ecosystem builders to participate and cultivate more potential high-quality developers to enter the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.  \n  \n**1\\.

      "content": "IMPORTANT: This account doesn't have an on-chain identity because the Kusama network has been experiencing issues for the last 19 days, preventing any user from creating one. You can verify this [here](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic?page=1&time_dimension=date&module=identity)\n\nWe have tried on numerous occasions to establish an on-chain identity. From extrinsics in polkadot.js and from friendly interfaces like Polkassembly, all times without success.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[Kanary](https://kanary.site) is an initiative born to create a massive Trojan horse to attract new users to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Inspired by Kusama's \"canary\", Kanary harnesses the attraction and marketing power of memecoins to capture the attention of communities from other blockchains and motivate users to delve into the technology and tools of the ecosystem.\n\nTo date, Kanary has successfully formed partnerships with memecoin communities from ecosystems such as Polygon, Base, BSC, and Solana, as well as collaborations with NFTs DAOs. It has also received positive reception on platforms like YouTube and other media.\n\nKanaryTeam's strategy has been to work 'outside' to attract, rather than working internally to then bring the community to blockchains outside the ecosystem.\n\nWe present **Kusama Exploration** as an educational initiative for all these new users arriving massively on our social media and groups. We aim to capitalize on this situation to introduce and guide users through a practical learning process, sparking interest and showcasing the authentic dormant potential in Kusama and Polkadot to different crypto communities.\n\nYou can learn more about the impact we are achieving at:\n\nWebsite: https://kanary.site\nTwitter:  https://twitter.com/kanarytoken\nTelegram: https://t.me/kanarytoken\n\n![](https://assets.zyrosite.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,w=245,h=163,fit=crop/mnl59lOwenTgR27J/kanary.3-YX4PWL1gE5snp2aZ.png) ![](https://assets.zyrosite.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,w=240,h=163,fit=crop/mnl59lOwenTgR27J/meme42-Y4L4o282eKS5zGM5.jpg)\n\nFull proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAEAEANPA2uC9cHvNy_HvRySGBTRg5Y3lODcXkscD54/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nAny inquiries can be directed to our team at team@kanary.site.

Concretely we look to on-board 5 to 10 new DAOs(communities) by the end of Q2 to help us gather important feedback that help us build a product the Kusama community but more importantly regular users will be happy to use.\n\nThe team will also use the funds to contribute to the core Polkadot protocol via the technical Fellowship in topics we've become quite proficient like governance improvements. \n\n---\n\n**Budget:** 1 FTE ~= 6,500 USD **|** 1 Month * 9 FTE = 58,500 USD **|** 3 month(9 FTE) = **175,500 USD**.\n**Asked:** 3,333 KSM * 50.54 USD/KSM(EMA30) = **168,449.82 USD**.\n\n---\n\nFor more context please refer to previous proposals or leave us a comment to elaborate more on any given topic.\n\n> The Virto team continues to have the long term vision to tackle social inequality and will continue to shape its experiments and developments towards said goal.",

      "content": "## Dear Kusama community,\n\n##  Meet ParaSpell:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/h7j6qDm/main-Logo.png)\n\n## A set of common good XCM tools.\n\n## This is the current state of tools:\n\nThere are three tools from which - one is core for the other two. Each tool can be installed independently.\n\n-   [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Core component for both API and Router. Meant to unify the cross-chain experience on Polkadot and become a layer 2 protocol that allows for seamless integration of XCM into your dApps. XCM SDK groups all 50 integrated XCM-compatible Parachain XCM Pallets into one uniform package and allows you to generate cross-chain calls with just one line.\n-   [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api): (LightSpell⚡️): Meant to ease the integration of XCM interoperability into your dApp, offload your dApp from heavy computing and save you costs. LightSpell implements XCM SDK into simple API endpoints.\n-   [XCM Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router): (SpellRouter☄️): Meant to allow you to create XCM calls where you receive different assets than assets you send (Eg. Send -> DOT from Polkadot, receive ASTR on Astar)—all in just one call.\n\n## The core and the only XCM SDK you will ever need\n\nCreated, when there were no other SDKs for XCM in the ecosystem. At the sole beginning of Polkadot. Born from a wild idea, to unify the XCM experience in the ecosystem. Meet our battle-hardened and well-established [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk).\n\n[![sdk](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/4348e5e4-b4cc-4205-a890-41efc6cfac15)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\n### The abilities you gain by using XCM SDK:\n\n-   Ability to transfer XCM messages from/to 50 different XCM compatible Parachains (Number of compatible chains fluctuates as some of them are added/removed)\n-   Support for all three XCM transfer scenarios (UMP - Para to Relay, DMP - Relay to Para, HRMP - Para to Para)\n-   Testing on testnet or localhost (You can input custom API parameter or even custom Parachain ID)\n-   Useful asset queries, XCM pallet queries, minimal deposit queries and more!\n-   Ability to use a keep-alive kind of XCM transfer which checks the balance of the account on the destination chain and determines if the amount you send is sufficient.\n\n**XCM SDK has since the last 4 months of maintenance had a total of 7.287 downloads on NPMJS**\n\n## Want to go packageless and save space? We got you\n\nMeet our [award-winning](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) and first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api) in the ecosystem. XCM API packs every XCM SDK and XCM-Router feature and allows you to implement XCM packagelessly.\n\n[![api](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/e81d3404-f29f-43d8-8744-a7104569b6b7)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api)\n\n### The advantages of LightSpell⚡️ XCM API for developers:\n\n-   Simplified XCM message construction via unified patterns\n-   XCM API reduces call construction time to seconds\n-   Built-in user error prevention for seamless operation\n-   Built-in Token authentication for DDoS prevention\n-   Easy to use tech stack: Typescript, Nest.js, ParaSpell XCM-SDK\n-   Completely free with an MIT license\n-   Also designed for simple private deploy\n-   XCM API handles complex logic and you are only required to provide basic details to create calls (Junctions and other complex details are auto-filled for you)\n-   API Offloads your server from heavy computing required to construct calls (You receive constructed message already)\n-   API saves you server costs (Because of the reason mentioned above)\n-   API features Package-less integration (No need to install anything compared to SDK alternatives)\n-   API is simple to implement (Constructed to be as dev-friendly as possible)\n-   API is already live on the following link: [https://api.lightspell.xyz](https://api.lightspell.xyz)\n\n**XCM API Served since its launch 142 days ago (September 13th. 2023) a total of 126.782 requests and faced 0 downtime**\n\n## Sending one asset cross-chain and receiving another was never this easy\n\nMeet our latest state-of-the-art technology called [XCM-Router](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router). It is easy to implement and has plenty of awesome features like automatic exchange chain selection! Featuring **579** asset exchange pools makes it the largest liquidity routing tool in the Polkadot. Try it out via [playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router/tree/main/playground)!\n\n[![router](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/a13e17fa-7c9f-4c36-a37a-d1770b29bee7)](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router)\n\n### You gain the following advantages by implementing SpellRouter☄️:\n\n-   The ability to transfer assets cross-chain via XCM while being able to exchange them for another asset all within one call.\n-   Offlift users from the complexity of moving assets to another chain in order to exchange tokens just to send them to another chain later\n-   Developers able to hide asset exchange complexity and skip multiple implementation steps\n-   Developers save the time required for complex research\n-   Complex logic hidden in simple one-line calls\n\n**Eager to find out how XCM Router works? Check out the sequential diagram below.** (This example uses XCM Router implemented in XCM API)\n\n![275827358-d0cf38cc-48e2-4b25-9853-8c2b59e0424f](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/ae457dda-b744-453e-acd1-f8a14d86a5e8)\n\n**XCM ROUTER has since it was introduced 49 days ago (Dec 15th. 2023) had a total of 1.826 downloads on NPMJS**\n\n## Implementation made easy with our [docs](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\nMeet our comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) covering just about every topic developers will meet with when implementing XCM and our tools into their dAPPs.\n\n[![docs](https://github.com/dudo50/dudo50/assets/55763425/02abaaa4-8166-4058-a240-2771d3b35df2)](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\n**Docs had a total of 109 refactor and update deployments on GitHub pages since their launch**\n\n## Our team and history:\n\n-   By now we completed 5 Web 3 Foundation grants meant to fund the development of our common good tools. This goes to show our dedication to the topic and the community. They can be observed here: [Phase 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1118), [Phase 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1245), [Phase 3](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1589), [Phase 4](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1817) and [Phase 5](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2057).\n-   We have been granted trust from the Kusama community twice in the following grant proposals that helped us further perfect our tools: [Maintenance 1](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/123) and [Maintenance 2](277) in which we have 1 last month to cover (February).\n-   Our latest achievement is getting 🥇first place at the Polkadot Global Series APAC 2023 Hackathon in the XCM Integration track with XCM API. [Here is the final announcement post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/angelhack_polkadothackathonapac-activity-7108072292718428160-i1dr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).\n\n**The team behind the project has been hacking in the Polkadot ecosystem for a while now.** The team consists of 2 members:\n\n-   Dušan Morháč: [Recent PBA 2023 Buenos Aires Alumni](https://singular.app/collectibles/statemine/20/12), Building in ecosystem since 2021, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dudo50/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/dudo50)\n-   Michael Absolon: Typescript expert with 3 years of professional experience, Building in the ecosystem since 2022, [LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael--absolon/), [GITHUB](https://github.com/michaeldev5)\n\n## Aim of this proposal:\n\nThe proposal aims to aid server costs and maintenance for the 🥇 first [XCM API](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api) and [XCM ROUTER](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router) in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem. Maintaining XCM API and XCM ROUTER also includes maintaining its core component - [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk). These common good tools will be fully maintained for the mentioned period starting on 1st March and ending on 1st August. This proposal allows all three tools to remain completely free for the entire Polkadot and Kusama community. It also allows our team to dedicate time to help other teams that wish to implement our tools.\n\n### What are you getting by implementing one of our tools or more\n\n-   Complex support with implementation (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n-   Prompt issue solving if any occurs (Feel free to open an issue in any repo)\n-   Constant updates for every package (We strive to bring new features for each tool)\n-   Comprehensive [documentation](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/) for each tool\n-   Reliability (Checked each month for changes in Pallets or compatible Parachains)\n-   **Guarantee, that everything is free for everyone. The ParaSpell✨ team aims to deliver only the common good, be completely open-source and free with no hidden costs or subscriptions.**\n\n### What are you getting as a non-developer/dApp user by supporting this proposal\n\n-   Our products allow dApps to be created much faster, so you can enjoy their benefits quicker.\n-   You can be sure, that dApp implementing our tool is safe for XCM as our tools are thoroughly tested and regularly updated. There are multiple ways to lose assets cross-chain.\n-   You too can try our products via the Playgrounds we build [API Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-api/tree/main/playground), [Router Playground](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-router/tree/main/playground) or try out the [deployed version of Playground](https://playground.paraspell.xyz/).\n-   We have been in the ecosystem for a while now and we are hardcore ecosystem fans. We will continue maintaining the tools even if we are short of funding (Just at a slower pace). So you do not have to deal with your dApp suddenly disabling your favorite feature. This is because we primarily build and maintain these tools to make life easier for everyone - not for profits (There is no business model or hidden fees in any of our tools. They are purely common good).\n\n## Proposal schedule\n\n-   Discussion: 2. Feb. 2024 - 8. Feb. 2024\n-   Voting: 9. Feb. 2024 - 22. Feb. 2024\n\n## Proposal ask\n\nThe proposal seeks 30.000$ worth of funding for 5 months of various maintenance tasks and assistance to other teams. This is divided into 6.000$ per month and 25$ per work hour. More information can be found in the full proposal document.\n\n## Documents associated with this proposal:\n\n**[Full proposal (Contains detailed information on how we plan to use funds)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AfRYf-dcEec-7VXJuLtJjPMCRZ0vo145TLgZj_SPKZA/edit?usp=sharing)**\n\n[One pager](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFuXF5a0As/ylxqRR43pe3_XRWC27IH-A/edit?utm_content=DAFuXF5a0As&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)\n\n[Documentation for XCM ROUTER, XCM API & XCM SDK](https://paraspell.github.io/docs/)\n\n[Forum post prior to this discussion](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-revolutionary-set-of-xcm-tools-for-dapp-developers-paraspell/5625)",

      "title": "Funding a Decision Deposit Sponsor",
      "content": "### Summary\nRequested amount: 3,333 KSM\n\nRecipient: GqdJv3Kgva6AckTFT8N8ZGXzAuXWU5RjK4auNvKCEu7jmzV\n\nTimeline: ~6 months (then refunded back to the Treasury)\n\nCommunication Channel: https://t.me/KSM_DD_SPONSOR\n\nDiscussion Context: https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2610 \n\n### Problem\nThere are many well-intentioned individuals in the ecosystem that would like to try bold experiments on Kusama, but lack the necessary funds to place large decision deposits on the more powerful openGov tracks. This bottlenecks experimentation on the network, limiting it to the whims of whales who may not have the creativity or understanding to push innovation on Kusama.\n\nPushing a powerful referendum into the decision period should be expensive to prevent malicious attacks, but it inherently prevents highly reputable and good users who don't have tens of thousands of dollars from pushing new and exciting ideas without winning the whim of a whale.\n\n### Proposed Solution\nI propose funding a multisig-managed governance proxy whose signatories consist of a good number of ecosystem agents with super majority threshold. This configuration ensures that only governance actions could be taken with these Treasury funds. The social layer of the signatories ensures that we only use these funds to place decision deposits and not to vote on referenda or delegate to anyone.\n\nIf the ecosystem approves and funds this initiative, we will first test it by placing the decision deposit on a root track referendum that will schedule a `balances.forceTransfer` of the 3,333 KSM back to the Treasury at block #24,300,000, effectively limiting the timeline of this experiment. Since the longest decision period is ~200,000 blocks, we will need to cease decision deposit activity by block #24,000,000 to ensure that the funds are free to transfer back to the Treasury. After the funds get transferred back to the Treasury, we can assess how this experiment performed.\n\nThis will be a passive experiment, meaning that we won’t actively try to elicit referenda from the community. Rather, we will field sponsorship requests on a case-by-case basis as they come in. The amount being funded will only allow us to sponsor one root track referendum OR many other-track referenda at a time. This means we’ll need to be selective in the case of multiple referenda requesting sponsorship. Given the experience of the signatories we hope the ecosystem can trust our discretion in placing deposits.\n\n### Signatories\n\n#### Eduardo Cardoso\n\nEkQWFRUHmSt8qCwmgYv8TNSaFu1Xo5DaDAHBZbZZFxXMwDr\n\n*Professional with extensive experience (more than 20 years) and award-winning projects.

For the past 9 months we worked hard to bring our vision to life. It has been a period of constant learning and pivoting in this fast paced environment. We are very proud of where the project is going and what we have built: **anyone can now mint governance participation rewards and receive royalties whenever they are traded**. \n\nWe demoed this with a [sendout for all voters of Referendum 0](https://t.co/bkkytK5D1U) on Kusama.\nMost of the work done to date has been covered through our last funding round in November of last year. As the future around NFTs was very uncertain at the start of this year we took the strategic decision to run our engine on minimum steam until there was more clarity on the horizon. Through this decision we have been able to stretch our last funding pretty far. \n\nWe did run a bit overboard though (19.2k USD) as we completely revamped our code base. We now have a new site and the new code allows for much quicker and cheaper implementation of new features in the future. For example with the new codebase adding multi-chain support is now very easy. This proposal seeks retroactive funding for those hours and outlines our future roadmap.\n\nWith a period of heavy development to build a solid foundation behind us, we will now also start focusing on marketing our tool. Reward creators currently have to lock up approximately 7KSM per sendout for a referendum of 500 votes. So while they do earn royalties on the trades, in the current market climate it is tough to earn back that amount through trades. In this regard we want to launch a program that reimburses the first 10 reward creators with the amount paid/locked up through their send-outs. We have included a budget of 7KSM*10 to fund the first 10 creators and get things going.\n\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ANXZWZGL19taElFOsMQhUdSR5NdifYzvfqVdTToAHI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n----\n\n### Our Value To the Ecosystem\nOur goal is to bring more participants to on-chain governance on Polkadot and Kusama to secure the network through increased decentralization. Besides governance participation increasing notably since the introduction of our project in gov1, we also achieved doing the following:\n- We recently published a clean UI to allow anyone in the ecosystem to send NFTs as rewards for participating in on chain governance. \n- We work alongside many other ecosystem teams to elevate the whole. We frequently discuss with Parity, Encointer, Kilt and Kodadot to provide feedback and develop ideas in the realm of the Polkadot ecosystem. We are amongst the first builders on the nfts pallet on Assethub for example. Similarly we also created PRs for [Subsquare](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/pull/2298) and [Kodadot](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/pull/7013#issuecomment-1699470842) in the past as we found bugs and built new features for the respective projects.\n- We provide another interface (besides Polkassembly, Subsquare) for voting on OpenGov referenda (currently Kusama + Polkadot, more possible), that works in the browser and on mobile (besides Nova, SubWallet). We think it is important to have different options available.\n- [Our code](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/website) is fully open source. We build with the latest tech and best practices. Our codebase is a valuable example for any current and future builders. Things develop fast and not every aspect of the ecosystem is well documented. In these areas especially using our code as an example will save future builders many hours of reaching out to teams for clarification and pain-staking debugging. We have gone through that process already with various ecosystem teams and through our lessons learnt helped improve documentation as in the example of KILT.\n\n",

For the past 9 months we worked hard to bring our vision to life. It has been a period of constant learning and pivoting in this fast paced environment. We are very proud of where the project is going and what we have built: **anyone can now mint governance participation rewards and receive royalties whenever they are traded**. \n\nWe demoed this with a [sendout for all voters of Referendum 0](https://t.co/bkkytK5D1U) on Kusama.\nMost of the work done to date has been covered through our last funding round in November of last year. As the future around NFTs was very uncertain at the start of this year we took the strategic decision to run our engine on minimum steam until there was more clarity on the horizon. Through this decision we have been able to stretch our last funding pretty far. \n\nWe did run a bit overboard though (19.2k USD) as we completely revamped our code base. We now have a new site and the new code allows for much quicker and cheaper implementation of new features in the future. For example with the new codebase adding multi-chain support is now very easy. This proposal seeks retroactive funding for those hours and outlines our future roadmap.\n\nWith a period of heavy development to build a solid foundation behind us, we will now also start focusing on marketing our tool. Reward creators currently have to lock up approximately 7KSM per sendout for a referendum of 500 votes. So while they do earn royalties on the trades, in the current market climate it is tough to earn back that amount through trades. In this regard we want to launch a program that reimburses the first 10 reward creators with the amount paid/locked up through their send-outs. We have included a budget of 7KSM*10 to fund the first 10 creators and get things going.\n\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ANXZWZGL19taElFOsMQhUdSR5NdifYzvfqVdTToAHI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n----\n\n### Our Value To the Ecosystem\nOur goal is to bring more participants to on-chain governance on Polkadot and Kusama to secure the network through increased decentralization. Besides governance participation increasing notably since the introduction of our project in gov1, we also achieved doing the following:\n- We recently published a clean UI to allow anyone in the ecosystem to send NFTs as rewards for participating in on chain governance. \n- We work alongside many other ecosystem teams to elevate the whole. We frequently discuss with Parity, Encointer, Kilt and Kodadot to provide feedback and develop ideas in the realm of the Polkadot ecosystem. We are amongst the first builders on the nfts pallet on Assethub for example. Similarly we also created PRs for [Subsquare](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/pull/2298) and [Kodadot](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/pull/7013#issuecomment-1699470842) in the past as we found bugs and built new features for the respective projects.\n- We provide another interface (besides Polkassembly, Subsquare) for voting on OpenGov referenda (currently Kusama + Polkadot, more possible), that works in the browser and on mobile (besides Nova, SubWallet). We think it is important to have different options available.\n- [Our code](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/website) is fully open source. We build with the latest tech and best practices. Our codebase is a valuable example for any current and future builders. Things develop fast and not every aspect of the ecosystem is well documented. In these areas especially using our code as an example will save future builders many hours of reaching out to teams for clarification and pain-staking debugging. We have gone through that process already with various ecosystem teams and through our lessons learnt helped improve documentation as in the example of KILT.\n\n",

So while they do earn royalties on the trades, in the current market climate it is tough to earn back that amount through trades. In this regard we want to launch a program that reimburses the first 10 reward creators with the amount paid/locked up through their send-outs. We have included a budget of 7KSM*10 to fund the first 10 creators and get things going.\n\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ANXZWZGL19taElFOsMQhUdSR5NdifYzvfqVdTToAHI/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n### Our Value To the Ecosystem\nOur goal is to bring more participants to on-chain governance on Polkadot and Kusama to secure the network through increased decentralization. Besides governance participation increasing notably since the introduction of our project in gov1, we also achieved doing the following:\n- We recently published a clean UI to allow anyone in the ecosystem to send NFTs as rewards for participating in on chain governance. \n- We work alongside many other ecosystem teams to elevate the whole. We frequently discuss with Parity, Encointer, Kilt and Kodadot to provide feedback and develop ideas in the realm of the Polkadot ecosystem. We are amongst the first builders on the nfts pallet on Assethub for example. Similarly we also created PRs for [Subsquare](https://github.com/opensquare-network/subsquare/pull/2298) and [Kodadot](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/pull/7013#issuecomment-1699470842) in the past as we found bugs and built new features for the respective projects.\n- We provide another interface (besides Polkassembly, Subsquare) for voting on OpenGov referenda (currently Kusama + Polkadot, more possible), that works in the browser and on mobile (besides Nova, SubWallet). We think it is important to have different options available.\n- [Our code](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/website) is fully open source. We build with the latest tech and best practices. Our codebase is a valuable example for any current and future builders. Things develop fast and not every aspect of the ecosystem is well documented. In these areas especially using our code as an example will save future builders many hours of reaching out to teams for clarification and pain-staking debugging. We have gone through that process already with various ecosystem teams and through our lessons learnt helped improve documentation as in the example of KILT.\n\n",

For the past 9 months we worked hard to bring our vision to life. It has been a period of constant learning and pivoting in this fast paced environment. We are very proud of where the project is going and what we have built: **anyone can now mint governance participation rewards and receive royalties whenever they are traded**. \n\nWe demoed this with a [sendout for all voters of Referendum 0](https://t.co/bkkytK5D1U) on Kusama.\nMost of the work done to date has been covered through our last funding round in November of last year. As the future around NFTs was very uncertain at the start of this year we took the strategic decision to run our engine on minimum steam until there was more clarity on the horizon. Through this decision we have been able to stretch our last funding pretty far. \n\nWe did run a bit overboard though (19.2k USD) as we decided to completely revamp our code base. We now have a new site and the new code allows for much quicker and cheaper implementation of new features in the future. For example with the new codebase adding multi-chain support is now very easy. This proposal seeks retroactive funding for those hours and outlines our future roadmap.\n\nWith a period of heavy development to build a solid foundation behind us, we will now also start focusing on marketing our tool. Reward creators currently have to lock up approximately 7KSM per sendout for a referendum of 500 votes. So while they do earn royalties on the trades, in the current market climate it is tough to earn back that amount through trades. In this regard we want to launch a program that reimburses the first 10 reward creators with the amount paid/locked up through their send-outs. We have included a budget of 7KSM*10 to fund the first 10 creators and get things going.\n\n\nThe full proposal can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18ANXZWZGL19taElFOsMQhUdSR5NdifYzvfqVdTToAHI/edit?usp=sharing).\n",

API has been up for 5 days now and we cannot wait to see what it can achieve in 5 months from now.\n\n##  This is how XCM API works\n\n![howapiworks](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268458206-27e4b2db-adfa-4fb2-8b47-ba29d8c2162a.gif)\n\nIn the following gif, you can see different XCM calls being created and useful asset query operations (Unique to our API and SDK). These are especially handful for front-end use cases.\n\n## Implementation made easy with our docs\n\nMeet our comprehensive docs covering just about every topic developers will meet with when implementing XCM and our tools into their dAPPs. ![docsgif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268457700-ec761625-1963-46c0-8edc-9e7af3b02c4e.gif)\n\n## Our team and history:\n\n-   By now we completed 4 Web 3 Foundation grants meant to fund the development of our common good tools.

API has been up for 5 days now and we cannot wait to see what it can achieve in 5 months from now.\n\n##  This is how XCM API works\n\n![howapiworks](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268458206-27e4b2db-adfa-4fb2-8b47-ba29d8c2162a.gif>)\n\nIn the following gif, you can see different XCM calls being created and useful asset query operations (Unique to our API and SDK). These are especially handful for front-end use cases.\n\n## Implementation made easy with our docs\n\nMeet our comprehensive docs covering just about every topic developers will meet with when implementing XCM and our tools into their dAPPs. ![docsgif](<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/268457700-ec761625-1963-46c0-8edc-9e7af3b02c4e.gif>)\n\n## Our team and history:\n\n- By now we completed 4 Web 3 Foundation grants meant to fund the development of our common good tools.

As Gavin mentioned in this CoinDesk article, WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. Also, as mentioned in the approved WASM smart contracts bounty, smart contracts parachains lead the ecosystem in terms of market adoption. However, despite WASM tech having a lot to offer, it's not being widely used now simply because of the lack of proper tooling and ecosystem infrastructure products.\n\nOpenBrush is a core infrastructure product, a starting point, and a base for every ink! dApp. Nineteen production-grade teams and three parachains currently use OpenBrush. This proposal is the delivery of the previously approved development of the successful product, proposing the most developer-needed features validated by market feedback.\n\nPlease note that we did additional research and have made the decision not to proceed with the planned and approved 12th milestone and are not requesting funding for it. However, we were forced to do some additional scope of work in order to fix unexpected issues after the Rust nightly toolchain's latest release.

      "content": "Dear DotSama community, GM/GN!\n\nI am DrCAO, the Community Manager of the Polkadot parachain project, Parallel Finance. I also lead a Chinese community in Wagmedia, a member of the WagMedia committee, the director of the Centrifuge Chinese community, and an Ambassador for several Polkadot parachain projects such as Astar Network and Bifrost. Additionally, I'm a member of Chaos DAO. As the founder of the AIWeb3 community, I wish to share updates from the past six months and seek the renewal of the AIWeb3 community.\n\nThe mission of the AIWeb3 Chinese community is to nurture the community, enabling Chinese content creators to focus on content creation in DotSama. We aim to bridge different parachain projects and ensure the community receives the latest information about DotSama. This environment allows Chinese content creators to concentrate on research, producing high-quality content, which includes dubbing, translations, and original pieces centered around DotSama. Moreover, we are allocating more resources to support budding content creators, helping them to cultivate their audience and brand.\n\nThe AIWeb3 Chinese community caters to individuals passionate about the dotsama, Web3, and its long-term prospects. This includes content creators in Dotsama and its enthusiasts. The community believes in Web3 technology for the future, being open and honest, and always keep learning.\n\nIn the last half-year, backed by the Kusama treasury, because of the excellent content creators and community support, AIWeb3 surpassed our own expectations, executing all planned tasks and even extending beyond our initial mandate. We produced over 600 original pieces, completed 28 translations with 35 proofreadings, and created 4 top-tier dubbings. We welcomed 19 content creators into our fold, with 13 making at least one contribution. Their expertise spans from DeFi to NFTs, art design, and event organization.\n\nWe've fostered relationships with over 20 parachain teams, pitching 16 collaborative initiatives to garner additional support. We've forged partnerships with Neurolauncher, the community-driven NFT marketplace Bluez within the Astar ecosystem, and the decentralized platform, Frentube ([https://twitter.com/fren\\_tube).](https://twitter.com/fren_tube\\).) Our endeavors also encompass both in-person and online events.\n\nAs of August 1st, our official Twitter ([https://twitter.com/aiweb3dao](https://twitter.com/aiweb3dao) has 1993 followers. Our Discord server ([https://discord.gg/pQtZG8UQfk](https://discord.gg/pQtZG8UQfk) has 535 members, our Telegram group ([https://t.me/aiweb3dao](https://t.me/aiweb3dao) has 328 members, and our decentralized Polkaverse space ([https://polkaverse.com/10900](https://polkaverse.com/10900) has 173 posts. Our presence extends to a WeChat Official Account and a video channel, \"爱Web3\", each video averaging over 1k views. We've also developed a Discord bot enriched with AI capabilities, and an intriguing role-upgrade game centered on a book about Polkadot, still in progress. In conclusion, the treasury's support over the past six months enabled us to offer Web3 education, nurture content creators, consolidate the community, devise a Discord bot now utilized by other parachain teams, establish pivotal partnerships in DotSama, revitalize Chinese communities, and achieve much more!\n\nour monthly report contains more updates:\n\nJuly report:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0raBj\\_MQcNKmOZkgm439zenVvYzunZl3LCMb0DWwOA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0raBj_MQcNKmOZkgm439zenVvYzunZl3LCMb0DWwOA/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nJune report:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AvTcV66yGhpuPn-U-Te0Ic-z5XjBQhcPt9Kp1qGNkXQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AvTcV66yGhpuPn-U-Te0Ic-z5XjBQhcPt9Kp1qGNkXQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nMay report:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaqfcUvt4QHa6v9AEXNs2s9YbON1xcnBhGGE5utvTkU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaqfcUvt4QHa6v9AEXNs2s9YbON1xcnBhGGE5utvTkU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nApril report:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVQFia8YDbB8yS\\_VDSN\\_rkTaJRXG1xxo8xVCdvZu-qs/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PVQFia8YDbB8yS_VDSN_rkTaJRXG1xxo8xVCdvZu-qs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nFeb-March report:  \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfTYTHzPJMVSStFxCxsS9kWfszgqM1OxF58vbjhprMg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sfTYTHzPJMVSStFxCxsS9kWfszgqM1OxF58vbjhprMg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe Full English version proposal can be found here： \n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/194jzl3FZN4T8kZuUTRdQSaitUGwRbNjSpU3ww6Z4p\\_0/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/194jzl3FZN4T8kZuUTRdQSaitUGwRbNjSpU3ww6Z4p_0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nWe have posted our proposal in discussion for 2 weeks and got all positive feedback, we now hope to get your support, and I would be happy to answer any questions related to the proposal as well.

Our original total ask between the first and second allocation was $289,313. Due to the depreciation of the Kenya Shilling to the dollar in February, March and April, the funds went a much longer way in covering the costs for the conference. Additionally, a few contributors worked a few hours and we substituted them with new contributors from February. Both of these factors rendered our new difference to decrease from $55,186 to $24,400.\n\nI did not factor that in when I was submitting the referenda two weeks ago.\n\nPlease find our report and request for funds [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cNkVSpiFSz1dbwlHUm_dg_F6rie0CpGE7TFXv5AQ1TI/edit). The $24,400 is what's left to pay off the organizer's. We had specifically ensured that we paid off all of the conference expenses before fully paying off ourselves.\n\nThank you for understanding, and may the sky be your basement.  \n  \nSianoi",

To this end, we openly share our operational statistics with the community. This information is readily available at our dedicated portal, https://stats.dwellir.app/. \n\nHere, stakeholders can gain insight into our service to the various Kusama communities. We believe this transparency not only promotes accountability but also underscores our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of service delivery for the communities we serve.\n\n- Our Kusama RPC nodes served on average **3,064,391** requests per day and in total **275,795,145** during the last quarter. \n- Our Statemine RPC nodes served on average **757,182** requests per day and in total **68,146,379** during the last quarter.\n- Our Westmint RPC nodes served on average **102,939** requests per day and in total **9,264,542** during the last quarter.\n\nOur full proposal can be [read here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iKqYGYYSHl3BBxnb-18Wnog-ML2qbZ9zERqEMrBaVhA/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nFor any questions or comments, please write in this thread.\n\n/Team Dwellir",

      "content": "We'd like to fund maintenance of the [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) from August 2023 until October 2023.\n\nThe [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) is a Rust library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC in a no-std environment. An RPC client is a library, with similar features as [Polkadot-js](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/polkadotjs). With an RPC client developers can easily interact with any Polkadot or Kusama chain. There are [RPC clients](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-tools-index#rpc-and-api-tools) for different programming languages. For Rust, the most popular RPC client is [subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt). Subxt uses the Rust standard library (std). The Rust standard library is not available in certain environments, such as trusted execution environments (like IntelSGX) or certain IoT devices. The substrate-api-client bridges this gap,  providing a library that can be used in such environments.\n\nThis proposal is a continuation of our previous maintenance proposals: [Nov22-Jan23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26), [Feb23-Apr23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88), [May23-Jul23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/182). See also our reports in the comments section of each proposal. We aim to seek ongoing funding.\n\nDetails can be found in our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VP5x4rQAgZr1q_KrHiAzGWfZGIsDOGq3vwWR-uUoWAQ/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "**Proponent:** ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP\n\n**Date:** 18th July 2023\n\n**Requested:** KSM 2,534.3895 (USD $62,110.28)\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\n**Full Proposal:** [Kusama Q2 2023 Treasury Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHIh9fcqbhiDz0tqAFTaxm2-zU56XK_3CpM0r_CcvvU/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Raw Data:** [Kusama Data Q2 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mb5GI3KAz3mza0qehduwd332DtVoPNrpR2MIZHr2ZCc/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginal Motivation\n===================\n\nOver the last 3 months (April, May and June 2023) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing infrastructure  services that can be depended on\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how validator nodes are running and scaling as the network traffic increases (we've made Github issues based on behaviour we've observed)\n\nBackground on our RPC Service\n=============================\n\nSince inception in November 2020 we have made a large number of improvements to our Ultimate API service focussing on three key areas; performance/reliability, providing more value from our Ultimate API service, and cost optimisation.\n\n### Performance/Reliability\n\nOnFinality is operationally striving for a minimum of 99.99% reliability, which means less than an hour of downtime each year.  We proudly display and share our [90 day uptime statistics](https://status.onfinality.io/) for each network publicly [here](https://status.onfinality.io/uptime/r40wwpclbwzm).\n\nWe have invested hugely into a team dedicated to optimising our application gateway and caching layer to ensure that we provide the fastest possible service for our customers. We run clusters in 5 different regions (North Virginia, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Singapore, and Australia) and across 3 different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Alicloud) to ensure that we are fault tolerant to any single region or cloud provider ceasing service.\n\n### Providing more value from our Ultimate API service\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we've been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. [Geolocation insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now [automatically upsize the storage on nodes](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-developer-update-auto-expand-storage-for-dedicated-nodes/) to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nFinally, in Q2 of 2023 OnFinality [launched Trace API](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/) support which was a huge enhancement allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders. Trace API captures and records vital information otherwise not available through regular RPC methods and extrinsics (such as complete XCM transfer records and complete list of balance changes). These APIs are essential in order for [developers like Polkaholic](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinalitys-new-trace-api-helping-colorful-notion-get-trace-data-from-over-40-substrate-chains/) to parse and understand XCM transactions.\n\n### Cost Optimisation\n\nOnFinality is very conscious about providing a strong level of support for Polkadot/Kusama at an extremely competitive price. Cost saving measurement has been a significant focus on behalf of our customers, with advanced rate limiting controls implemented. We can, for example, rate limit each client on a burst and sustained basis and based on the request methods that they are calling (e.g. each state_traceBlock request is rate limited 45x more than chain_getBlock), [read more about these advanced rate limiting tools that we've developed here](https://documentation.onfinality.io/support/public-rate-limits).\n\nMeaning that we can continue to provide generous public API endpoints for over 40 different networks for common-good applications, but restrict access to high volume users that abuse this free service. We've been able to manage our costs significantly on behalf of our customers as a result. \n\nWe've [developed and shared our approach towards service sustainability](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/1270), with the introduction of a 'Paid API Revenue Share Discount' scheme. In this scheme OnFinality pools the revenue from customers that pay for higher API pricing plans and distributes this revenue pool to partners that currently pay for and own each API endpoint proportionally based on the number of paid API requests that go to that API endpoint. The scheme was introduced in Q1 of 2023 and resulted in a discount to [Kusama's Q1 treasury proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/183) of $281.90.\n\nOur cost optimisation efforts were validated in Q1 as we had the lowest cost per million responses across all of the major RPC providers that lodged a proposal to the Polkadot treasury. You can see how our costs compared to other RPC providers in the ecosystem during Q1 [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Utw2HfS7I5Gpyhrl9ejuj0CrQ4AcChGFteXdw0a8tro/edit#gid=0).\n\nService Details\n===============\n\nDuring Q2 of 2023, we've made a number of new improvements to our Ultimate API service that address performance/reliability, features, and costs.\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [Launched Trace API](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-launches-trace-api-for-unprecedented-visibility-into-your-dapps/) allowing unprecedented visibility for dApp builders.

OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they've all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Polkadot chains. You can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/).\n\nBetween 2023-04-01 and 2023-06-30 our Kusama API service has:\n\n-   Served almost 2  billion (1,962,258,944) responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 31,000 GB of data egress\n\n-   The highest daily total was over 42 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Kusama alone\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 10 million responses each day\n\n-   Statemine had over 130  million (132,310,628) API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Kusama is 42,881,996,808 (over 42 billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime on Kusama and Statemine was 99.93% and 100% respectively\n\nCostings\n========\n\nThis proposal includes combined running costs for our infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine. The total combined running cost is USD $62,110.28 - [raw data is here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mb5GI3KAz3mza0qehduwd332DtVoPNrpR2MIZHr2ZCc/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n**For breakdown of costings and more information, read the full proposal here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHIh9fcqbhiDz0tqAFTaxm2-zU56XK_3CpM0r_CcvvU/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hHIh9fcqbhiDz0tqAFTaxm2-zU56XK_3CpM0r_CcvvU/edit?usp=sharing)",

Gavin will give his consent in the comments. I will be available for any questions and suggestions throughout filming and editing. Happy voting! Lovisa Hello Kusama Community, My name is Lovisa Björna, and I have the last months been filming and recording a lot of material from Gavin’s day-to-day life, which I have been closely intertwined with for the last three years. I started recording some of the conversations we were having a while back, tapping “record” whenever something particularly interesting came up. Partly for me to remember later on, and to eventually be able to turn this material into something educational for the general public. I believe the moment has now arrived, and I am looking for a modest amount of funding from the Kusama treasury to purchase better recording equipment and, down the line, be able to hire a professional film editor to present the material properly. I’m also looking to onboard 2-3 people with experience in directing, sound design and art direction to pitch the film to film festivals and other media outlets. I am seeking 550 KSM / 13,271 USD to cover full production costs. The goal is to present a documentary film portrait of Gavin next spring. Due to the nature of the material, the project will not be focused primarily on explaining the details of the ecosystems, i.e. I won’t add any infographics as other people and projects can do that better. As it looks now, it is intimate “behind the scenes” material that shows him simply living, thinking and working. The conversations/interviews mainly treat themes of technology, specifically the introduction of new technology and how it works, philosophical enquiries around personal and collective freedom, state building and infrastructure, the responsibility of technologists and builders, and societal commentary and personal values. I will link a preview in the comments section. Before posting the complete application to the Kusama Treasury, I am interested in hearing if there are any specific themes/settings the community would be especially interested in exploring.

      "content": "> This is a follow up proposal to what we submitted before: \n> - [Subscan | Infrastructure Costs of Subscan for Polkadot & Kusama & Westend & Rococo Networks（until June 30, 2022）](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wXSELzfmNH1CP9JbI5Nq1wu8H83vnxJJ22TEjkF2Wgg/edit#heading=h.mja6oa2ekup8)\n> - [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/child_bounty/56](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/child_bounty/56)\n\n\nSubscan is an essential block explorer and analytics tool for the Kusama & Statemine network, providing valuable insights to the Substrate community. However, the maintenance and operation of Subscan requires a significant investment of resources, including server infrastructure, security, and personnel costs. Therefore, we propose reimbursing the operation and maintenance fee for Subscan from July to December 2022 from the Kusama treasury to ensure its continuous operation and maintenance.\n\n\nWe believe that this reimbursement proposal will help to ensure the continuous operation and maintenance of Subscan, and benefit the growth and development of the Kusama network. This time, we plan to apply for a total of 60,185 USD in Kusama, the amount of KSM will be converted based on the EMA7 price on the day of the official submission.\n\n\nBilling details can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14jxQGNpviEkQBA8owGX1j2AyCUeNJ_t9QN-p-7he36E/edit?usp=sharing).\nWe sincerely hope to receive your support or feedback.",

      "content": "Dear Community!\n\n[Polkawatch](https://kusama.polkawatch.app/) provides decentralization analytics for Kusama.\n\nWe recently delivered improved observability for Polkawatch based on Node-Red, improved its plugin, and shared it all with our community in a [blog post](https://blog.polkawatch.app/polkawatch-observability/) in case anyone finds it useful.\n\nWe also added Parachain Support, including those based on Aura consensus, and included decentralization analytics for [Statemine](https://statemine.polkawatch.app/), sharing it in another [blog post](https://blog.polkawatch.app/parachain-support-statemine/).\n\nAlong the process we found [2 issues](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/6696) in Polkadot/substrate, and collaborated with the developer teams during the resolution.\n\nWe also implemented community feedback, adding Scaleway as redundant IPFS endpoint, instead of using only Hetzner.\n\nWe are now seeking for 9 months Continued operation for Polkawatch.\n\nThe proposal has been created in a context in which our Treasure is constrained. As such we have deferred new developments and claim operational costs only after 50% has been delivered, in an attempt to contribute to improve the cash-flow position of our Treasury.\n\nYou can find all the details in our [detailed proposal](https://pwh.li/ksm23q13pf), and do not hesitate to provide additional feedback.",

With support from its core team and over 100 contributors, KodaDot prioritizes creators, developers, and community members from diverse backgrounds. The platform emphasizes environmentally responsible practices, collaborating with [Offsetra](https://offsetra.com/profile/kodadot) and [RMTerra](https://blog.kodadot.xyz/you-dont-need-to-go-far-to-help-the-nature-just-mint-on-kodadot-496fc60cd748) for emissions compensation and global reforestation efforts. KodaDot's success and commitment to quality have earned it the top position in GitHub's \"polkadot\" topics, demonstrating its strong presence in the decentralized application landscape ranking as [#1 dApp in Polkadot](https://github.com/topics/polkadot).\n\n## Overview of proposal\nThis proposal focuses on integrating RMRKv2 into KodaDot, a community-driven and inclusive NFT marketplace on the Kusama network, in response to RMRK’s shift towards Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) support. The goal is to provide Kusama users with continued access to a sustainable and accessible platform for NFT trading using the latest RMRKv2 standard.\n\n## Funding requested:\n$100,000, divided into two installments ($72k for Milestones 0-3, $28k for Milestones 4-7)\n\n## Full proposal link:\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1EJ7OAUwKzC4wjjMATOJxZWLKo9kxS8137Or_Y4rME](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1EJ7OAUwKzC4wjjMATOJxZWLKo9kxS8137Or_Y4rME)\n\n## Requested amount:\n- $72,000 for milestones 0-3 (Completed)\n- $28,000 for milestones 4-7 (Ongoing & Upcoming)\n\n## Context of the proposal:\nBy integrating RMRKv2 into KodaDot, this proposal aims to fill the gap left by RMRK's focus on EVM and maintain a sustainable, inclusive platform for NFT trading within the Kusama network. The goal is to strengthen the Kusama NFT ecosystem through the integration of RMRKv2 and foster community engagement, innovation, and cross-chain collaboration. The implementation process, milestones, partnerships, and success criteria are detailed in the proposal context.\n\n## Objectives\n- Integrate RMRKv2 into KodaDot to provide Kusama users with a sustainable and inclusive platform for NFT trading and engagement.\n- Strengthen the Kusama NFT ecosystem through collaboration, innovation, and cross-chain integration.\n- Ensure continued success and growth of Kusama's NFT ecosystem, catering to creators, collectors, and traders using the latest RMRKv2 standard.\n\n## What happens if the implemenation doesn’t happen?\n\nIf the implementation does not happen, the Kusama community and NFT creators, collectors, and traders would miss out on the following benefits:\n- Seamless access to a thriving NFT marketplace that supports the RMRKv2 standard.\n- A dynamic ecosystem for artists, developers, and collectors, enabling more robust and versatile NFT creations.\n- Encouraging further innovation and development within the Kusama network, allowing for the expansion of projects and use-cases.\n- Enhanced user experience and greater trading opportunities within the NFT ecosystem as a result of a community-driven development process.\n- Improved opportunities for cross-chain integration, partnerships, and collaborations within the broader Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems.\n- NFTs, as long-term assets with potential for value appreciation, require a focus on growth and maintaining value. KodaDot's RMRKv2 integration offers unique content on the Kusama network, promoting NFT sustainability and value in the evolving digital space. With a robust custom implementation, KodaDot provides reliable data longevity for NFT transactions and serves as a dependable NFT explorer. Furthermore, KodaDot's efficient and optimized platform outperforms competitors, as its bundle is 270 times smaller, ensuring resilience in the NFT trading process.",

Unification of XCM pallets which are currently very diverse can bring ease of integration and speed up dApp development significantly. This Polkadot forum post goes to show, that developers actively search for such tools. [link](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/grant-ideas-and-wishlists/399)\n\n**Links that might interest you:**\n\nLink to the pre-proposal discussion held between 20.May-27.May: [Polkassembly](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2577), [Subsquare](https://kusama.subsquare.io/post/9)\n\nXCM SDK - [link](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk)\n\nAn organization with all repositories - [link](https://github.com/paraspell)\n\nOur previous Kusama treasury funding - [link](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/123)\n\nDelivery of Kusama treasury funded proposal - [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lMY_8EtQ41IX7Zn9VIMAiG1k3oLYN0h_lVj8dWDwZ_k/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOur current metrics can be seen here - [link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/239685371-84a5214e-ccc6-41c8-b551-7ff655304501.png) , our SDK is also implemented by the biggest Polkadot NFT marketplace called KodaDot.\n\n**Further information** on the maintenance mechanism, management of the funds and budget can be found in the [maintenance proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FIHTKMcsWC6VGg1I-dz--5JLAk0GbKv8ZpZciek-awA/edit?usp=sharing).",

      "title": "Ziggurat - Kusama Treasury Proposal - Milestone 1",
      "content": "This is a proposal relating to the previous discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2570). As requested in the previous discussion we:\n- Clarified some budget items and staffing assignments\n- Created a more non-technical oriented TL:DR and description\n- Reached out to the Kusama and Polkadot developer communities and asked for their feedback\n- Received a positive response from aforementioned communities (as evidenced in the discussion above)\n\nTL:DR:\n\n1.  Network level attacks are an unresearched area of risk for blockchains\n2. Ziggurat helps detect network level attacks before they happen.\n3. We propose to build out Ziggurat to support substrate based networks, starting with Kusama.\n\n## Short Description\n\nA Ziggurat is a rectangular stepped tower that uses precise measurements to ensure that each foundation can support the layers above.\n\nThis metaphor can be applied to network testing by defining three layers:\n\n- Conformance: adherence to the network protocol\n- Performance: healthy throughput under pressure\n- Resistance: the withstanding of malicious behavior\n\nZiggurat by Equilibrium, is a set of tools that allows node developers to test these three layers extensively and ensure that each new release does not introduce bugs, performance bottlenecks, or security flaws.\n\nAs mentioned in the conclusion of the recent [Trail of Bits report](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd11235b3950c2c1a3b6df4/62af6c641a672b3329b9a480_Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf): It’s only a matter of time before a blockchain network is completely toppled by a network-level hack. This proposal will detail why this work is critical, and how we will go about solving it.\n\nZiggurat currently supports a multitude of other blockchains, but does **not yet** have support for any Substrate-based chains such as Kusama.\n\nThis proposal is for the **first milestone** of this process: Creating a test plan. Please see **Milestone 1's** description in the overall proposal [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit#heading=h.3xl84ufmazmq).\n \n## The Team behind it\n\nLukasz Jedrzejczyk ([GitHub](https://github.com/ljedrz), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljedrz)) has followed the development of Rust since before it became stable in 2015 and has been a proactive contributor to the Rust compiler and its StackOverflow community. He has participated in the development of multiple peer-to-peer nodes belonging to blockchains and other distributed systems, usually concentrating on the network layer. Notable examples are Rust IPFS and Aleo.\n\nNiklas Long ([GitHub](https://github.com/niklaslong), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklaslong)) deeply cares about open source, distributed systems and data privacy. He has been on the Aleo Core Team since late 2020, mostly overhauling, testing and profiling their network; is the author of Ziggurat and an active contributor to Rust IPFS.\n\nKarlo Mardešić ([GitHub](https://github.com/Rqnsom)) is an embedded software engineer with a solid background in time network synchronization. An eager and passionate learner, he joined Eiger searching for exciting problems in the blockchain world and is currently focused on testing the network protocols. He takes great pleasure working in Rust and OSS community.\n\nMark Henderson ([GitHub](https://github.com/aphelionz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aphelionz)) is the VP of Engineering at Equilibrium. He has led the team starting with the original Rust IPFS grant in late 2019, through engagements with many of the largest names in Web3, and is now circling back to finish the critical work the team started with the original Ziggurat proposal. Core contributor to OrbitDB, Rust IPFS, and Ziggurat.\n\n## Proposal Team Experience\n\n[Equilibrium](https://equilibrium.co/) is a software consultancy and venture studio with a mission to further privacy and decentralization. Our clients include StarkWare, ZCash, Aleo, Protocol Labs, The Ethereum Foundation, The XRPL Foundation, Polygon and quite a few more. Our expertise is deeply technical, and we also employ economists and expert cryptographers to deliver results beyond the bounds of software development.\n\nMuch of our recent work has involved the design and testing of peer-to-peer networks in both familiar (e.g. libp2p) and customized contexts. Our impact typically falls into the following categories:\n\n**Bug Fixing**\n\n- detecting vulnerabilities using dedicated fuzz tests\n- squashing memory leaks\n- detecting and fixing blocking operations in asynchronous contexts\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- creating alternative implementations of network protocols\n- creating thorough network integration tests\n- simplifying existing implementations, suggesting protocol improvements\n\n**Profiling**\n\n- creating integration-level benchmarks\n- detecting and investigating memory/CPU spikes\n- introducing/increasing parallelism where applicable\n\n**Network Analysis**\n\n- crawling swarms using the P2P network layer (not RPC)\n- visualizing data to display on a web-based interface\n- gathering metrics such as reachable node cardinality, as well as node and network protocol versions\n\nFurthermore, Equilibrium has a taste for graphic and product design, seen in the execution of Vanilla, the [XRPL Hooks Playground](https://hooks.xrpl.org/), and the in-progress [Ziggurat GUI](https://app.runziggurat.com/zcashd) site itself.\n\nFor a detailed budget and breakdown of price, see the [attached proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nUnfurled:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing",

We propose to build out Ziggurat to support substrate based networks, starting with Kusama.\n\n## Short Description\n\nA Ziggurat is a rectangular stepped tower that uses precise measurements to ensure that each foundation can support the layers above.\n\nThis metaphor can be applied to network testing by defining three layers:\n\n- Conformance: adherence to the network protocol\n- Performance: healthy throughput under pressure\n- Resistance: the withstanding of malicious behavior\n\nZiggurat by Equilibrium, is a set of tools that allows node developers to test these three layers extensively and ensure that each new release does not introduce bugs, performance bottlenecks, or security flaws.\n\nAs mentioned in the conclusion of the recent [Trail of Bits report](https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fd11235b3950c2c1a3b6df4/62af6c641a672b3329b9a480_Unintended_Centralities_in_Distributed_Ledgers.pdf): It’s only a matter of time before a blockchain network is completely toppled by a network-level hack. This proposal will detail why this work is critical, and how we will go about solving it.\n\nZiggurat currently supports a multitude of other blockchains, but does **not yet** have support for any Substrate-based chains such as Kusama.\n\nThis proposal is for the **first milestone** of this process: Creating a test plan. Please see **Milestone 1's** description in the overall proposal [**here**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit#heading=h.3xl84ufmazmq).\n \n## The Team behind it\n\nLukasz Jedrzejczyk ([GitHub](https://github.com/ljedrz), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljedrz)) has followed the development of Rust since before it became stable in 2015 and has been a proactive contributor to the Rust compiler and its StackOverflow community. He has participated in the development of multiple peer-to-peer nodes belonging to blockchains and other distributed systems, usually concentrating on the network layer. Notable examples are Rust IPFS and Aleo.\n\nNiklas Long ([GitHub](https://github.com/niklaslong), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/niklaslong)) deeply cares about open source, distributed systems and data privacy. He has been on the Aleo Core Team since late 2020, mostly overhauling, testing and profiling their network; is the author of Ziggurat and an active contributor to Rust IPFS.\n\nKarlo Mardešić ([GitHub](https://github.com/Rqnsom)) is an embedded software engineer with a solid background in time network synchronization. An eager and passionate learner, he joined Eiger searching for exciting problems in the blockchain world and is currently focused on testing the network protocols. He takes great pleasure working in Rust and OSS community.\n\nMark Henderson ([GitHub](https://github.com/aphelionz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aphelionz)) is the VP of Engineering at Equilibrium. He has led the team starting with the original Rust IPFS grant in late 2019, through engagements with many of the largest names in Web3, and is now circling back to finish the critical work the team started with the original Ziggurat proposal. Core contributor to OrbitDB, Rust IPFS, and Ziggurat.\n\n## Proposal Team Experience\n\n[Equilibrium](https://equilibrium.co/) is a software consultancy and venture studio with a mission to further privacy and decentralization. Our clients include StarkWare, ZCash, Aleo, Protocol Labs, The Ethereum Foundation, The XRPL Foundation, Polygon and quite a few more. Our expertise is deeply technical, and we also employ economists and expert cryptographers to deliver results beyond the bounds of software development.\n\nMuch of our recent work has involved the design and testing of peer-to-peer networks in both familiar (e.g. libp2p) and customized contexts. Our impact typically falls into the following categories:\n\n**Bug Fixing**\n\n- detecting vulnerabilities using dedicated fuzz tests\n- squashing memory leaks\n- detecting and fixing blocking operations in asynchronous contexts\n\n**Implementation**\n\n- creating alternative implementations of network protocols\n- creating thorough network integration tests\n- simplifying existing implementations, suggesting protocol improvements\n\n**Profiling**\n\n- creating integration-level benchmarks\n- detecting and investigating memory/CPU spikes\n- introducing/increasing parallelism where applicable\n\n**Network Analysis**\n\n- crawling swarms using the P2P network layer (not RPC)\n- visualizing data to display on a web-based interface\n- gathering metrics such as reachable node cardinality, as well as node and network protocol versions\n\nFurthermore, Equilibrium has a taste for graphic and product design, seen in the execution of Vanilla, the [XRPL Hooks Playground](https://hooks.xrpl.org/), and the in-progress [Ziggurat GUI](https://app.runziggurat.com/zcashd) site itself.\n\nFor a detailed budget and breakdown of price, see the [attached proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nUnfurled:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRhFKo5w73wP5Nz8hg3xtw5GmPseNrzsarJLNNZqDZo/edit?usp=sharing",

I'm an ex-Database Developer who developed a passion for content creation in Web3 and have started a Youtube channel in April of 2018 with the scope to share my research with other crypto enthusiasts as well as use my tech knowledge to do tutorials and try and explain users something techier in a non tech way.\n\nAs Polkadot launched in 2020, I started doing media coverage about the ecosystem and have since been doing mostly that.\n\nI had previously raised a proposal (not for my main KryptosChain channel) in **January 2023** which had passed public voting and which is [#Ref.46](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/46) and  has since been delivered. \nYou can find the final delivery report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12kPiNeT9Zpc5xn3HXWgsaeM7YGRJV5dEL-97Uohf3_4). This was an initiative to grow a Romanian community who didn't have any content available about Polkadot. \n\nWhile delivering the proposal for #Ref.46 I had continued to produce content on my main channel, KryptosChain including interviews with Founders from the Polkadot ecosystem without requesting additional funding from the Treasury and had been managed within that budget as the KSM price had performed very well between referendum start date and receiving the funds and I felt it was only normal to do that for the community.\n\nThis new proposal is to request treasury funding for a new initiative which I believe and hope will bring a new group of users to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nTo produce a total of **116 videos** over a period of **6 months** of the following types:\n\n- Comparison videos between different ecosystems, Cosmos, Cardano, Solana, Aptos, Sui & Avalanche **x 52 videos** \n(Compare products such as DEFI dApps, wallets and NFT marketplaces from the above ecosystems to those on Polkadot and talk about the pros & cons)\n\n- General Polkadot ecosystem news **x 26 videos**\n\n- Open Governance news regarding treasury spends  **x 26 videos**\n(Kusama but will include Polkadot when / if it launches during this proposal period)  \n\n- Interviews with Founders / Co-Founders or other team members **x 12 videos**\n\nYou can find the **full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JjhrPR0z50IZSXiI423HbAhsx_4GyiSNRQS3_6ohWcA)\n\nThe discussion can be found by clicking the link at the top of this page which has been linked to this referendum.\n\nThe requested amount is **1,651.17 KSM** , worth approximately **$41,395 @ $25.07** per **KSM** at today's market price.\nShould the price of KSM appreciate within the 14 days + the additional days before the payment from the treasury is sent, I will be transferring the extra KSM back to the Treasury. Should the price drop, I will work with what I got and should it drop by a lot, I will be requesting an additional top-up to make up for it in a separate proposal (Let's hope it won't be needed).\n\nI look forward to your feedback over these next 14 days of the referendum.\n\nRegards,\n\nClaudio\n\n\n",

This was an initiative to grow a Romanian community who didn't have any content available about Polkadot, while delivering the proposal for #Ref.46 I had continued to produce content on my main channel, KryptosChain including interviews with Founders from the Polkadot ecosystem without requesting additional funding from the Treasury and had been managed within that budget as the KSM price had performed very well between referendum start date and receiving the funds and I felt it was only normal to do that for the community.\n\nThis new proposal is to request treasury funding for a new initiative which I believe and hope will bring a new group of users to the Polkadot ecosystem.\n\nTo produce a total of **116 videos** over a period of **6 months** of the following types:\n\n- Comparison videos between different ecosystems, Cosmos, Cardano, Solana, Aptos, Sui & Avalanche **x 52 videos** \n(Compare products such as DEFI dApps, wallets and NFT marketplaces from the above ecosystems to those on Polkadot and talk about the pros & cons)\n\n- General Polkadot ecosystem news **x 26 videos**\n\n- Open Governance news regarding treasury spends  **x 26 videos**\n(Kusama but will include Polkadot when / if it launches during this proposal period)  \n\n- Interviews with Founders / Co-Founders or other team members **x 12 videos**\n\nYou can find the **full proposal** [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JjhrPR0z50IZSXiI423HbAhsx_4GyiSNRQS3_6ohWcA)\n\nThe requested amount is **1,592.72 KSM** , worth approximately **$41,395 @ $25.99** per **KSM** at today's market price.\nThis will be adapted when the referendum will be created on-chain to the current market rate and should the price of KSM appreciate within the 14 days + the additional days before the payment from the treasury is sent, I will be transferring the extra KSM back to the Treasury.

      "content": "Polkassembly is an integral part of polkadot and kusama governance. This submission proposes a recurring payment (quarterly) to cover maintenance, operations and human resource costs for Polkassembly, including general maintenance, runtime upgrades changes and could/infrastructure cost. This submission covers costs for April, May, June of 2023. The maintenance proposal alternates between Polkadot & Kusama treasury and we are requesting the Kusama treasury to provide funds this time.\n\nThis recurring proposal aims to secure the continuous operation and sustainability of Polkassembly, a vital component of Polkadot and Kusama governance.\n\nTo ensure the smooth functioning of Polkassembly, we request a recurring quarterly payment to cover essential expenses such as maintenance, operations, and human resources. The funds are allocated towards general maintenance, runtime upgrades, and infrastructure costs, guaranteeing the reliability and efficiency of Polkassembly.\n\nSpecifically, this submission addresses the funding requirements for the months of April, May, and June in 2023. As part of the alternating maintenance proposal between the Polkadot and Kusama treasuries, we kindly request the Kusama treasury to provide the necessary funding for this period.\n\nAttached below are key highlights of our proposal: \n\n- **Customization**: Implementing a customizable and dynamic notification engine across multiple platforms (mail, telegram, slack, discord) to enable users to receive personalized notifications.\n- **Preview Images**: Creating identifiable proposal preview images at the chain level, making it easier for users to interact with hyperlinks.\n- **Anti-Spam Features**: Allowing users to flag spam proposals and comments, with warnings displayed on the UI and moderation team action taken within 24-48 hours.\n- **Partnerships**: Integrating the option to build custom quizzes for proposers, collaborating with Proof of Chaos team to reward correct answers with NFTs. Partnering with Grill chat and Subsocial Team to facilitate anonymous on-chain communication.\n- **Content & Education**: Establishing a dedicated webpage for blogs, tweets, and digests from Polkassembly to keep users updated on initiatives.\n- **Audit**: Creating an audit section for proposals, enabling auditors to reach a wider audience by adding their audit links to proposals.\n- **Site-wide Improvements**: Enhancing discussion post linking for better community engagement. Providing edit history for proposals and comments, allowing users to report problematic comments. Adding on-chain events to the calendar, leveraging Polkascan's APIs and allowing filtering by chain level. Enabling image upload in posts and comments for user convenience. Implementing comment sentiment upgrades to view overall sentiment and filter comments accordingly.\n\n\n\nThe full proposal is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_JYFNEV8Y5l5bzs79zD5u--go225vhsfuXuzMNXrDH8/edit).\n\n",

Furthermore, by forcing communities to live off-chain, user engagement with dapps is lowered.\n\nAt Subsocial, we spent three months researching the needs of the ecosystem, and began implementing the foundation for Polkadot’s Open Communication Layer. We realized that, although Web3 communities, and their communications, should be moved on-chain, there was too much friction with actually using a blockchain for this.\n\nTo address this problem, we created [Grill.chat](https://grill.chat) as a proof of concept for OpenComm, showing how easy it is for users to start communicating on-chain. The onboarding process is even faster than Web2 apps that we are used to, as you don’t even have to create an account; you just send your first message and an account is automatically generated for you.\n\nWith OpenComm, all governance discussions will take place on-chain, and the content and messages will be freely accessible by anyone.

      "content": "**Proponent:** ELkVhHcvaP9L43RK9SP6Wn3FBfusEN5EJe2gH7aA2ETiufP (OnFinality)\n\n**Date:** 8th May 2023\n\n**Requested:**  1,835.806 KSM (USD: $51,971.31)\n\n**Short description:** Ongoing costs for the running of high performance, scalable, and reliable public infrastructure for Kusama and Statemine.\n\n**Full Report:** [Kusama Q1 2023 Full Report/Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Raw Data:** [Kusama Data Q1 2023](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kLH15a_iPl8F-DmDnYekGlDxnj3zx_-0FP3Meb3bKP8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n* * * * *\n\n## Original Motivation\n\nOver the last 3 months (January, February, March 2023) we've provided a scalable free public API service so that everyone can access public pools of managed Kusama and Statemine nodes. This provides the following three outcomes:\n\n-   Grow the ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry to access a high performance nodes\n\n-   Help scale existing projects in the ecosystem by providing reliable infrastructure services\n\n-   Assist with the testing of all networks by providing valuable data back to the community on how nodes are running, what calls are causing errors, and where traffic is originating from\n\n## Service Details\n\nDuring Q1 of 2023, we've made a large number of stability improvements to our Ultimate API service to allow us to add a large number of new parachains over the last quarter as well as support for multiple chains outside of Polkadot.\n\nFor customers that do sign up for paid API keys, we've been adding more and more features to provide a better experience. Geolocation insights provide statistics about where in the world communities are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives.  We can also now automatically upsize the storage on nodes to prevent the risk of any downtime.\n\nOur customers are building cross-chain wallets, running some of the largest block explorers, and are indexing multiple networks - they've all benefited from these API access restrictions, improved monitoring, and the larger number of supported Substrate chains.\n\nBetween 2023-01-01 and 2023-03-31 our Kusama API service has:\n\n-   Served a total of 2.08 billion responses\n\n-   Accumulated over 43,000 GB of data egress \n\n-   The highest daily total was 62 million responses in a single 24 hour period for Kusama only\n\n-   Our rolling 7 day average at the end of this period was over 33 million responses each day\n\n-   Stateme had over 190 million API responses in the period\n\n-   All time totals for Polkadot is 40,919,737,864 (nearly 41 billion) since November, 2020\n\n-   At the end of this period the 90 day uptime for Kusama and Statemine was 99.96% and 99.99% respectively\n\n## Enhancements\n\nAdditionally, we are proud to have delivered some key service enhancements that benefit the Polkadot ecosystem in the last quarter. This includes:\n\n-   [Auto Expand Storage](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-developer-update-auto-expand-storage-for-dedicated-nodes/) - When the node's storage reaches 85% utilisation, the storage size will be automatically increased by 10%. Saves developers and devOps time on having to constantly check on and manually upgrade their node storage size\n\n-   [Partnership with POKT network](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-partners-with-pocket-network-to-unlock-access-to-unstoppable-infrastructure/) to bring in more external developers into the Polkadot ecosystem\n\n-   [Geographical Insights](https://blog.onfinality.io/onfinality-adds-geolocation-insights-for-dapps-and-api-apps/) - API key owners can view statistics about where in the world your community are to help influence decisions around where to expand infrastructure and to view the effectiveness of regional BD initiatives\n\n-   [Clarify our IP address handling](https://blog.onfinality.io/how-does-onfinality-deal-with-personal-information/) - OnFinality does not, and will never, correlate or link specific wallet addresses to the IP address or request origin making the RPC request\n\n-   We're testing access to various unsafe methods like traceBlock and subscribeStorage that will help developers create applications that utilise XCM - contact us if you would like to be part of the beta\n\n-   Reduced our exposure to any single cloud provider - Progressively migrated resources away from AWS to other cloud providers for lower cost and exposure.\n\n-   Expanded our OnFinality for Startups Programme to support teams from the Substrate Builders Programme and Scytale Ventures\n\n-   Added support for a number of new networks, including Ajuna, Unique, Clover, SORA, Composable Finance, Collectives, xx network, as well as Polygon, BNB, Fantom, Gnosis and Evmos from outside the ecosystem. OnFinality is a new one stop shop for all of your RPC needs from multiple ecosystems.\n\n-   A variety of improvements to our health metric collection tools and automated recovery scripts to ensure our 99.9% SLA is exceeded.\n\n-   Scale improvements to our team, processes, and systems to allow us to provide this same service to any  substrate team\n\nYou can always see live data on our API service on our public [status page](https://status.onfinality.io/) and [network analytics page](https://onfinality.io/networks).\n\n**Full report can be read here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsf8h4wio7lyH0_yrSdSdJ4lGfSSepyscWixoBEdTxI/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "content": "We'd like to fund maintenance of the [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) from May 2023 until July 2023. This is a continuation of the [Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88).\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC in a no-std environment. An RPC client is a library, with similar features as Polkadot-js. With an RPC client developers can easily interact with any Polkadot or Kusama chain. There are RPC clients for different programming languages. For Rust, the most popular RPC client is subxt. Subxt uses the Rust standard library (std). The Rust standard library is not available in certain environments, such as trusted execution environments (like IntelSGX) or certain IoT devices. The substrate-api-client bridges this gap,  providing a library that can be used in such environments.\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the treasury proposal [Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88). View our [report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/88#agl5qxkd9WZSVyBV2G9Y) for details on our work there. We aim to seek ongoing funding. Since the funds of the Kusama treasury are currently limited, and many projects ask for funding, we decided to make a smaller proposal and focus on changes that are needed due to substrate updates.\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2566) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VZyGcRs9pvks_FCm5B0BO1sikZIsJjAYeJCuehL7jyQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details.\n",

      "title": "Sublab proposal #KSM-2: Substrate client improvements and Kotlinization",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nWe're proud to present our next proposal from the Sublab team which primary focus is on developing tools for developers in Substrate ecosystem.\n\nPlease feel free to read the full proposal document at this link: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KOXw-huf61dz9U__jIEoEks-J1pbkKdwzjzlQYIu9o/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KOXw-huf61dz9U__jIEoEks-J1pbkKdwzjzlQYIu9o/edit#)\n\n![](https://sublab.dev/logo.png)\n\n**Context of proposal**\n\n[sublab.dev](sublab.dev) is the California based company designated to develop fully native open-source libraries for mobile platforms in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, covering everything with reliable unit-tests and providing rich documentation to the developers community.\n\nWe've recently finished our [very first proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/532) within which we created 13 Swift and Kotlin repositories to operate with Substrate networks. While we have basic functionality, we still need to develop more features to reach current ecosystem state and its functionality. Also, we agreed to collaborate with a couple of projects in ecosystem to develop base SDKs for their services in Swift and Kotlin, and chose extra providers to develop SDKs for, which cover most popular functionality in mobile applications. Furthermore, we now seek to make our Kotlin libraries be written fully in Kotlin and use only Kotlin libraries so that we can make our libraries ready for Kotlin Multi Platform.\n\nWe initially tried to propose bigger amount of functionality to faster reach current state of ecosystem, but even though we received many approvals, our [proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/351) haven't reached its majority. So after gathering feedback from the community and the council, we decided to decrease our scope to minimum required functionality to support all parachains and make our libraries available in all major dependency managers as long as with being ready for Kotlin Multi Platform development, also we lowered our hourly rate in order to match current market. Also, since our libraries still do not have major users we're going to participate in as many as possible public and online events to spread the word. \n\n**What we're trying to accomplish within this milestone**\n\nMost of our efforts are projected to be put into Substrate client we made for Swift and Kotlin.\n\nPrimary purpose is to create pre-created set of models and functionality like popular and common between all networks constants, storage queries, functions and events, so end developer will not need to always write boilerplate code. This potentially saves thousands of hours if we take into consideration multiple teams working with these libraries. Also we want to boost our extrinsic service to have all day-to-day methods in it: fees estimation, transfers, batch requests, and so on.\n\nSecondly, we want to develop special manager which will be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous clients at the same time. Mobile devices even though they're powerful nowadays still not almighty. Application sandbox is limited, thus in order to work with many networks in parallel we wish to create set of functions and classes which will be responsible for turning on and off all clients depending on current app function optimizing CPU and RAM usage.\n\nTo make this manager it's also needed to have some caching mechanism: we propose to create a database which will be responsible for storing everything from these multiple connections, work with pre-defined common constants, storage queries, functions, and events, combining everything together to speed up and optimize cold and hot starts of Substrate client instances.\n\nLast but not least part of Substrate client improvements in this milestone is to provide support to work with all existing parachains. Every network has their own runtime which sometime differs very much. So we look forward to create as many as possible unit tests to check compatibility of our Substrate client with every existing parachain today. Indeed this would require a lot of internal client changes. So we will do our best to keep our codebase clean and tidy, and at the same time powerful to handle dozens of different networks, and hundreds of connections.\n\nAlso, in this proposal we're looking forward to making a set of small libraries to provide SDK interface to most popular block explorers which are used for fetching history and many more: SubQuery, Subsquid and Subscan. For now, we decided to develop basic interface so that we don't dive too deep into all functionality and get burden of supporting it all. In this proposal we want to provide functionality that allows developers to use all of the service features, but maybe with small tweaks. However, we might find some solutions to do later to optimize and avoid this extra customization. As extra, there will be couple of token/fiat exchange rate resolvers to choose from.\n\nIn parallel, there are two small projects. Provide Combine interface in our Swift libraries so that Swift developers can choose what asynchronous approach they would like to use in their application. And Kotlinization. This is very special project for us: we have created a few of libraries in Kotlin from scratch like schnorrkel algorithm. And since we still rely on some Java libraries, it is not that easy to make our Kotlin libraries compatible with Kotlin Multi Platform. This technology opens a big opportunity to use our libraries in many different platforms from mobile applications to web, so we're encouraged to make our libraries ready for this bright future.\n\n**Our mission**\n\nWe want the Substrate ecosystem developers to just do brand new features to make the ecosystem richer and be recognizable by even more people around the globe, while we can hold their backs by doing a great infrastructural work. We want to see more mobile apps in the ecosystem either from existing parachains to launch their own apps or absolutely new mobile wallets with more innovative functions. Same we want to help existing applications by solving their core issues within our works and help them adopt our products. Also we aim to partner with as much as possible existing networks and/or companies who already deliver their services to ecosystem, so that even their products might be easy accessible via reliable SDKs.\n\n**Proposal financing and deliverables**\n\nWe're requesting $79,200 for the current milestone which includes improvements to existing Substrate clients, supporting all parachains with demo applications showing functionality, adding Combine interface to Swift libraries, adding Swift libraries as Swift Package Manager packages, and migrating our Kotlin libraries to use only Kotlin, not Java dependencies. Each part is planned to be released separately and sequentially along with publications to public package managers' repositories, as well as on our GitHub for a review. Also we're planning announcements on our Telegram channel and future Medium blog with a brief description of deliverables. And in the end when we finish documentation part we're going to publish on-chain report with appropriate links to the open source code, package managers' repositories, our articles on Medium, and links to documentation website ([https://docs.sublab.dev](https://docs.sublab.dev))\n\n**Epilogue**\n\nWe look forward to hearing from you any constructive feedback and/or questions regarding our planned works. Feel free to refer to our [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14KOXw-huf61dz9U__jIEoEks-J1pbkKdwzjzlQYIu9o/edit#)\n\nSincerely,\nSublab team",

      "title": "Sol2Ink Milestones 3 & 4 development (WASM smart contracts)",
      "content": "Dear Kusama Community,\n\nWe would like to share the proposal for the development of milestones 3 and 4 of [Sol2Ink](https://github.com/Brushfam/sol2ink).\n\nYou can check the initial discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2544).\n\nThe price was calculated by EMA7 rate on the date of proposal submission, so the calculations were the following: 112400 / 2 / 30.082 = 1868.22684662 KSM\n\n### TL;DR\nThis proposal aims to decrease the barrier of entrance for Solidity developers coming into ink!, by further improving our infrastructure product Sol2Ink. As Gavin mentioned in this [CoinDesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/25/polkadots-gavin-wood-webassembly-is-the-future-of-smart-contracts-but-legacy-evm-is-right-now/), WebAssembly is the future of smart contracts. However, we assume that businesses and developers hesitate to move their products to the Substrate/ink! smart contracts ecosystem because the resources and onboarding time needed for such a transition are just high compared to the potential reward. Sol2Ink decreases the time needed for such a transition rapidly. A transition that could have taken a few months may take a week. \n\nSol2Ink is our infrastructure product, which transpiles Solidity smart contracts to ink! smart contracts and can be used for businesses to help them with the transition as well as can help seasoned Solidity developers decrease the learning curve of ink! rapidly. This proposal is a continuation of the development of the product while also aiming to expand the ink! market to existing Solidity/EVM markets.\n\n### Context\nBased on the data, it seems that the Polkadot ecosystem is not fully attractive for existing projects from other ecosystems like Ethereum, Polygon, or other EVM chains. Even though these projects can be massively enhanced by all the features and possibilities available with Polkadot, Substrate, Rust, ink!, and WASM, there is little incentivization to migrate. They have their product working already, large liquidity and user base available, and onboarding to Rust and ink! can be difficult and resource-demanding. We also see that the onboarding layer for Solidity developers is rather high, which is caused by the difference in difficulty between Solidity and Rust programming languages.\n\nOur team at Brushfam is committed to creating a developer-friendly ecosystem for ink! smart contracts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Based on the data, we believe that our products, including OpenBrush, Sol2Ink, and Typechain-Polkadot, have become the starting point for every smart contract developer entering the ecosystem. Sol2Ink specifically aims to lower this entrance threshold by allowing seasoned Solidity developers to easily migrate from Solidity to more complicated Rust and ink!, while also serving the purpose of a learning tool to lower the learning curve.\n\n### Proposal\nWe would like to share our proposal for developing of milestones 3 & 4 of Sol2Ink. Sol2Ink is an infrastructure product used for an easy transition from Solidity to ink!. It aims to lower the entry barrier for businesses to transit from Solidity/EVM to ink!, and to lower the learning curve of ink! for seasoned Solidity developers.\n\n### Roadmap\n\nOur roadmap is divided into two parts:\n\n1. Market research and tutorial for Sol2Ink for introduction to the product - our goal is to research the interest for such a product between the Solidity / EVM stakeholders, which will also raise the awareness of the possibility of such an easy transition to a new promising ecosystem. We will also showcase how easy it is to create a full-stack ink! app in a video tutorial, just by providing the original Solidity code base.\n\n2. Upgrade of Sol2Ink focused on the output of fully compilable contracts - currently Sol2Ink can transpile most Solidity code bases in one click, but there is still a need for a developer to check the outcomes since it is a program producing code. Our long-term goal is for Sol2Ink to produce code, where the minimal interference of a developer with the produced code is needed to have a fully ready 1:1 application. The fourth milestone of Sol2Ink is the first step to achieving this goal.\n\n### Full Proposal\nFor more information on our proposal, including a detailed roadmap, please see the following link:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iTUZ7CeBTaPV-141EfJUjiISAniuK0dvNdeVhW-Bks/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13iTUZ7CeBTaPV-141EfJUjiISAniuK0dvNdeVhW-Bks/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1)\n\n\n\n**Great comment from public discussion.

Existing snapshots solution took around ~40 minutes to Download and our solution allowed to restore a validator in a couple of minutes.\n\n### Central Topic:\nParasnaps was launched in February 2022, this proposal aims to cover the costs and work generated by Parasnaps from August 2022 until its decommissioning in March 2023\n\n### Future Proposals:\nWith warp sync in its current state, we believe Parasnaps is no longer required and has been decommissioned in March 2023.\n\n\nPlease find the full proposal [here](https://hackmd.io/@tugytur/SyLCDyhfn).",

      "content": "**Update May 4:**\n\nAs my treasury proposal is going to be rejected by the majority of Kusama community, I would kindly ask those who voted Nay to provide me with at least a brief feedback. Your valuable feedback will allow me to improve my future proposals and avoid making the same mistakes. **Any feedback will be greatly appreciated.**\n\n---\nHello Kusama community, \n\nthis is Max, and this is the referendum on my **treasury proposal for 4-month funding** of my [Cryptozilla Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@CryptozillaKH/videos). \nPlease find the full treasury proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn_B-t_6HJ70LIvF1XYzwCDjvd9DHvls/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109251064373401876264&rtpof=true&sd=true).\n\nI am a long-term video content creator about Polkadot & Kusama networks and ecosystem projects. Over the **last 1 year 8 months, I have released 195 Polkadot/Kusama-related videos, in the last ∼7 months I have created 21 detailed dapp/UI tutorials.**\n\nI am asking for funding to produce **40 English educational videos**, that will be **delivered in the next 4 months (10 videos/month).**\nI am asking for the total amount of **$12,800** currently worth of **400 KSM** in accordance with the [7-day EMA](https://kusama.subscan.io/tools/charts?type=price).\n\n**I set the cost of one video for the Kusama treasury at $320.**\n\n**I create:**\n\n- dApp tutorials\n- Project reviews \n- “A bigger picture”-focused videos about the vision and role of the Polkadot in Web3\n\nA big part of my video creation are detailed ecosystem dapp/UI tutorials. **Within the last ∼7 months, I have released 21 tutorials.**\n\nIn the next 4 months, I am going to continue focusing on dapp tutorials and will create a detailed “hands-on” tutorial on each new dapp/UI launched.\n\nMy channel is the third biggest ecosystem-focused channel by **the average number of views/video - 394 views in the last 6 months.**\n\nIn [my proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jn_B-t_6HJ70LIvF1XYzwCDjvd9DHvls/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109251064373401876264&rtpof=true&sd=true), I put a strong focus on **providing KPIs** (Key Performance Indicators) of my channel over the last 6 months as well as the minimum, expected KPIs for the following 4 months. **Based on the past and projected KPIs, the CPV (Cost Per View) of my videos for the Kusama treasury will be between $0,92 - $1,28.**\n\nIn **the section 5 - ROI (Return on Investment)**, I aimed to provide my view at how the ROI of my video content can be measured and calculated, at least to some degree. \n\nIf this proposal is approved by the Kusama community, I will keep [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kC4E1EvXlyIH8XGfglKKF6CDYCnSW5eW2fS7DuD9g2Q/edit#gid=0) updated after each new video is released, **providing the community with all the KPIs, including the current CPV**. The spreadsheet will be available for the community to review and comment on anytime.\n\nOnce all 40 videos are delivered, **I will provide the community with a detailed performance report of all videos**, as well as with **the evaluation of how my set goals and projected ROI have been achieved.**\n\nI believe I have submitted a reasonable proposal to the Kusama community to vote on, bringing good value to the ecosystem, with reasonable pricing and mechanisms ensuring the treasury funds will be put to good use.\n\nThank you everyone for taking the time to review and consider my proposal and for voting. \n\nI will be happy to answer all your questions.\n\nMax\n\n(P.S. The prior discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2545).)\n\n",

      "content": "**Proposal Information:**\n\n🔹**Full proposal:** [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tO58ldSQOyyue0RPUslRx-crdMbMYoWUpq0jllkQOpg/)\n\n🔹**Discussion:** [Link>>](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2553)\n\n\n🔸Our previous Proposal #1: [Link>>](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/573)\n\n🔸Milestone Report #1: [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y3EcjT36WN6wlx4x-OoC7IzvvI1dJ7U0w50uSGAgBeE/)\n\n**Twitter Feedback:**\n\n🔸#1: [Link>>](https://twitter.com/RemarkPunks/status/1587922570828951553)\n\n🔸#2: [Link>>](https://twitter.com/RemarkPunks/status/1645026396689817607)\n\n---------------\n**Important updates after Discussion**\n\nAfter our initial discussion and many chats with community we decided to split the Milestone in **two parts** as well as funding for them. This is the 1/2 part of our Milestone, we will request remaining funding only after the Milestone is fully complete and report is published.  This first half of Milestone will include Statemine NFTs, general enhancements and mobile support and development of public API for Dotsama community.\n\n**Summary**\n\nKusaMint is a development kit for NFT artists, creators and the whole Kusama community in general. It provides different tools to mint and manage NFTs with ease.\nWe have successfully reached all milestones set in our previous proposal that became [Motion 573](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/motion/573).  \n\nThis proposal aims to receive funding that will allow us to offer Dotsama NFT community new functionality and expand to new NFT standards. \n\n--------------------------------\n\n**Key points in this proposal**\n\n- **KusaMint Enhancement**\n\n🔹 Access to NFTs on Statemine - Mint 1.0 NFTs on this chain. We aim to cover all possible NFT options in Dotsama eco, so KusaMint would be simply incomplete without Statemine.\n\n🔹 Mobile support - Mint/Manage NFTs from your phone. A mobile version of UI ready to be integrated to any crypto wallet.\n\n\n- **Public API**\n\n🔹REST API \n\n🔹GraphQL API \n\n**Potential API use cases:**\n\n- NFT Mint in crypto games - skins, achievements, characters, etc.\n\n- Marketplace integrations\n\n- Integrations to artists’ websites\n\n- NFT Mints for DAOs\n\n- …and many more\n\n--------------------\n**Requested Amount:** 1584 KSM/48987 USD (Proposal 2: 1190 KSM  + Proposal 1 Difference*: 394 KSM)\n\n**KSM price:** 30.91 USD (Coingecko data on 21th of April 2023)\n\n**Total team hours:** 780 Hours\n\n**Costs detalization:** [Link>>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tO58ldSQOyyue0RPUslRx-crdMbMYoWUpq0jllkQOpg/edit#heading=h.6aamk9mmhqlw)\n\n*Proposal 1 Difference - during our first proposal $KSM price dramatically went down, resulting in >$12000 loss. It was decided that we will apply to receive remaining funds in our next proposal. ",

      "content": "**Proponent:** [GHm6gp6khjcxQvnbnSsHdYejsFK1nNVxcGyGAsbDfsymtLr](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/GHm6gp6khjcxQvnbnSsHdYejsFK1nNVxcGyGAsbDfsymtLr)\n\n**Date:** 19 April 2023\n\n**Requested KSM:** 598\n\n**Short description:** a comprehensive directory for Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem & all its actors.\n\n**The PoC built:** \n\n- PoC [Polkadot Discovery Portal]([https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/](https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/))\n- Main repo - [https://github.com/anagolay/polkadot-discovery](https://github.com/anagolay/polkadot-discovery)\n- Kanban and dev board - [https://github.com/orgs/anagolay/projects/3](https://github.com/orgs/anagolay/projects/3)\n\n## Original motivation\n\n[Polkadot Discovery Portal](https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/) was born out of one developer’s struggle with finding artifacts, binaries, docker images, and specs for the chains he wanted to test. Through the discussion with fellow community members, the idea grew and evolved into the project you see in front of you, intended as a comprehensive ecosystem discovery: to connect all the ecosystem actors, from big to small. \n\nThe Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem is not only about parachains and relay chains; it’s also about pallets, wallets, apps and Dapps, browser extensions, utility libraries, websites, etc. In one word this ecosystem is about community. Without good project discoverability, the community cannot find the information it needs.\n\nOur aim is to make project discoverability seamless and simple. This way, everyone can access the information they need to contribute to the ecosystem's growth.\n\n## Retroactive payment for PoC development\n\nThis proposal is for **a retroactive payment** by Kusama Treasury to **reimburse for 60%** of the development costs for the work on Polkadot Discovery Portal PoC, [see the scope here](https://www.notion.so/kelp/Retroactive-Funding-for-Polkadot-Chain-Pallet-Discovery-09c9c9adc77e4f22b7c7b36494f991c5?pvs=4#4bcaaa1790d4481e9c9ba74f04ddeaea)\n\nIf this initiative gets initial support, as the next steps, based on the community feedback received so far, we are planning to prioritize the following: \n\n- coordinated projects onboarding, ambassadors engagement & incentives\n- implementing a minimalistic UI to allow for alternative forms of submissions\n- integrations with other platforms & channels\n\n## Key differentiators of Polkadot Directory Portal \n\n**All for chain discovery on Polkadot & Kusama:**\n\n- detailed descriptions & tags\n- runtime versions, genesis hashes\n- spec files for easy referencing\n\nUp-to-date and readily accessible information on the stage of each chain and the paraID and relay connection details for parachains.\n\n**Data updates & verification**\n\n- Any user can independently verify the info & contribute to improving the dataset by opening a pull request: [https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/how-to/](https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/how-to/)\n- To ensure the integrity of the data, we'll require a public display of approval from a member of the respective project (GitHub organization) before merging the PR.\n- See [Chart 1: Adding & Updating data](https://www.notion.so/kelp/Retroactive-Funding-for-Polkadot-Chain-Pallet-Discovery-09c9c9adc77e4f22b7c7b36494f991c5#ebc5785874ec4cdaaa7948e33ddab5e2) for details\n\n**Data Sources: \"Unused data is useless. Make the data flow!\"**\n\n- Anyone can access all the data collected and hosted on the Polkadot Discovery Portal in the form of JSON endpoints\n- the data sources are easily accessible as links on every project and pallet page on the right sidebar\n- focus on using the data instead of figuring out how to retrieve it.\n\n**Why all that?**\n\n- to provide developers, teams, and community members with a verified and trustworthy source of information for all things built on Polkadot and Kusama\n- minimize redundancies and maximize collaboration by streamlining the flow of information\n- ultimately, create a unified, comprehensive directory that drives progress and unlocks the full potential of the ecosystem\n\n**Please see the full proposal here  [https://www.notion.so/Retroactive-Funding-for-Polkadot-Chain-Pallet-Discovery-09c9c9adc77e4f22b7c7b36494f991c5](https://www.notion.so/Retroactive-Funding-for-Polkadot-Chain-Pallet-Discovery-09c9c9adc77e4f22b7c7b36494f991c5)** \n\nand, of course, check out the **Polkadot Discovery Portal** PoC already built [https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link](https://polkadot-discovery.macula.link/?ref=kusama_polkassembly_referenda_166)",

      "content": "Hello Kusama community,\n\nafter almost two years since our first proposal, we decided to come once again for your support. In this proposal, we are asking for $59,820 for the content creation, event organization and marketing activities for the  > Polkadot ecosystem that Polkadotters did since June 2022 with proposed funding until the end of this year (overall, a year and a half of our work).  \n\nFirst a bit of history - we started the first and only Czech & Slovak Polkadot community back in the summer of 2020 and after realizing that there isn't much quality content about Polkadot even in English, we decided > to fill this gap as well. Since then we have published almost 250 original articles on our Medium, promoted Polkadot and parachain ecosystem on YouTube interviews with various influencers, organized and co-organized a couple of conferences and meetups, hosted some popular Twitter Spaces with parachain teams and many more. \n\nTo put our current work into some numbers\n\n- 1591 followers on our Medium\n- almost 150k views of our articles with more than 40k reads\n- almost 5k followers on our Czech and English Twitter\n- around 15k views of videos where we promote and explain Polkadot with various local influencers\n- organized two local Polkadot meetups\n- co-organized the biggest altcoin crypto conference in Czechia with more than 1000 attendees with Polkadot as a main sponsor\n\nFor our future endeavors and how we plan to use the requested amount, please see the [detailed description and breakdown](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ou4nK4rvf-wehSCtO66nUQb6eJkS8BLRoLCzLOuAbfc/edit?usp=sharing) of our proposal. But in a nutshell, our aim is to keep delivering high-quality content and taking care of our local Czech community - with some extra perks like providing more content, developing a marketing strategy to reach a wider audience, starting to do monthly ecosystem recap videos, creating more Twitter content including spaces and many more. We also plan to focus on governance in general - by reviving our regular governance news, promoting interesting referenda in the ecosystem and obviously taking our part in voting and analysis of proposals. \n\nThank you for your support!\n\nYours Polkadotters :-) \n\nEDIT - To further bolster the chances of our proposal being passed, we have decided to put in some extra work we weren't planning to do! We will organize additional 6 meetups over the course of this year, and 3 of them will be in Prague starting in May. These meetups will hopefully bring more people into the Polkadot ecosystem and they will also serve as a promotion for conferences we co-organize - be it DOT Prague in June or the next iteration of DOT Brno in autumn. \n\nP.S. Links to our socials can be found on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/polkadotters)\n\nP.S.S. I have already submitted two referenda regarding this proposal - the first one (153) was with the wrong preimage set (`treasure.proposeSpend` instead of a `treasury.spend`) and the second one (154) was a swift attempt to cancel it while I didn't realize it takes 333 KSM for a deposit which we don't have. So these two referenda will eventually cancel out and I do truly apologize to the community for creating such a mess in the OpenGov. I learned my lesson and again, sorry for the mess!",

      "content": "**Context**\n\nWe are a team of academic specialists from [Robonomics Network](https://robonomics.network/) (which has a [parachain of the same name](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/explorer) on Kusama) led by Professor Alexander Kapitonov, one of the founders of the project.\nWe have set a goal to create comprehensive and illustrative educational materials for a wide audience with zero or initial knowledge of web3 technologies.\n\nAn explanation of our goals and lecture speech sample is also available on YouTube:\nhttps://youtu.be/WlGDvLHmbqE\n\n**Problem**\n\nResearch has shown that the existing courses dedicated to cryptocurrencies and web3, despite their sufficient elaboration, concentrate either on the financial component or are intended exclusively for developers. Courses dedicated to basic information about blockchain and web3, although they clearly explain the concept, do not give the potential user information about what values ​​and benefits he will get using decentralized applications. \n\n**Proposal**\n\nOur proposal is to create a course for those who see the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem for the first time. We plan to take several parachains that solve common web2 tasks and show these cases in video lectures and supporting text materials. A feature of the course will be the integral presentation of information with demonstration of real projects and everyday examples. We want to show ordinary users how basic knowledge of technology makes their life and everyday tasks safer and more convenient. \n\nWe plan to take several Kusama projects that solve regular web2 tasks, and show these cases in video lectures. Good candidates Statemine, Robonomics, Moonriver, Remark, Crust, Basilisk. We plan to release two variants of the course: on the Kusama mainnet and on the Rococo testnet. During the course the participants will use a combination of parachains to pass a task that will be evaluated by simple learning management system dapp.\n\nDeliverables: YouTube video lectures, GitHub texts and source code, dapp with learning management system elements.\n\n**Requested Amount**\n\nThe project is designed for 5 months and requests a total of 27 572,5$ (843 KSM).\n \n**Full Proposal**\n\nMore details are available in [the full proposal](https://crustipfs.art/ipfs/QmSgQbsSaT4he6BBtaGe3KwyjzZTRMM2FN6g9GCg32Xv3m).\n\nFeel free to share your opinion about the proposal. We consider feedback to be one of the key indicators of our project.",

      "content": "**Short description:** Funding for the production of 48 videos (Podcasts, interviews and tutorials) for the Spanish speaking community.\nBrand development and event attendance is included in the proposal. This content will be launched with a frequency of 2 weekly videos, for 6 months (May to October 2023).\n\nProponent: EAMbhBVW7SpJfH332uABbDNtsbNnaZBBXeGJwdfxkxkPm6o\nDate: April 7, 2023\nRequested KSM: 1,599.73  (7 days EMA) ($ 53,487.00 USD) KSM rate will be calculated on the date of submission and remaining KSM’s will be returned back to the treasury.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDiscussion since 9 days ago click [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2536).\n\nHi everyone! We are Nachito (Polkadot Senior Ambassador) and Roco (Polkadot  Ambassador). We have created a brand for the Spanish speaking community named [**DOTCAST**](https://linktr.ee/dotcast_), which started seven months ago as a weekly podcast on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3I8Ec-2pECzR_Y6lApwogA), based on the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem.\n It's not just an opinion podcast, we interview developers, founders and ecosystem members on the current topics of Kusama and Polkadot. We are also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dotcast_), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/68chK6sM4HYBPJlxSnSEBP?si=fc97e68479174e64&utm_medium=share&utm_source=linktree&nd=1) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@Dotcast_) as well. Constantly posting relevant info about the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem, aiming to “spread the word” in a friendly and understandable way for everyone.\n\nThis partnership began a year ago, translating from English to Spanish all the content that we considered important for the community. Like the rabbit-hole syndrome that we are sure many of you have experienced, we went from translating documents and ended up dubbing Polkadot videos for the community. \n\nIt's important to mention that we never discuss subjects related to price or financial speculation.\n\n**General Goals**\n\n- Create content that brings real value to our community.\n- Generate true and honest awareness.\n- Achieving growth in the Spanish-speaking communities around Polkadot.\n- Inspire others to get involved.\n- Show the community what and how the future is being built.\n\nOur development so far was covered by Wag Media, but we are looking to continue the work with a spending proposal.\n\n\n**Specific Proposal Goals**\n\n- Brand development for DOTCAST (Website creation, development and SEO on social media), seeking to increase visibility and followers.\n- Attend at least three Polkadot related events in 2023 (air tickets and hotel) creating original content within the event and increasing visibility with the focus on the Spanish speaking community.\n- To be able to pay for last year's re-branding and graphics to our designer.\n- Achieve stability to the team through funding and constant quality improvement on the product.\n\n**Problem statement**\n\n- Polkadot can be complex for its users, not to mention newcomers.\n\n- People need to be supplied with reliable and user-friendly information.\n \n- Lack of original and good quality content in native language that improves over time.   \n\n- Participation in governance should be encouraged.\n\n- Understand technical updates that are published.\n\n- There is a huge increase in the amount of information generated.\n\n- There is a large gap between the core ecosystem with its constituent members and people.\n\n**Solution**\n\nAs it was mentioned before, our goal is to continue creating original content for the Spanish speaking community aiming to raise awareness of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem with the focus on the way this technology is being built and which are the use cases for it.\n\n The general idea is to communicate in a friendly way so the potential users could feel in a peer to peer environment, as well as the users who already have a certain level of knowledge and would like to keep updated with quality information every week.\n\n We believe that Governance 2.0 is a key factor related to adoption and participation as well, with that being said we already dedicate a portion of the podcast to this topic to encourage people in this subject.\n\n The compiled information that we provide helps the community to stay updated in a trustless way, with the possibility to interact through comments, exchange opinions and generate feedback. \n\nAll of this is supported by interviews with developers from Parity and some of the parachains as well, and as you can check it for yourself, the community topic is always within our questions. Dotcast was born from the community and for the community, providing  a space for ecosystem projects to connect with people. \n\n**How does this proposal differ from other content creation initiatives?**\n\nThis proposal, in addition to creating original content in the native language, seeks to empower the community by binding their voices and encouraging them to participate in governance as a unit. With this union we also bring to spotlight the specific problems of our society looking for use cases within the ecosystem that can provide real solutions to users who need to be heard.  \n\nNowadays, the community is made up of dispersed groups that from time to time bind together to carry out a particular event. Dotcast believes that this union can be permanent, flexible and dynamic in order to achieve a clear message to the community users and accomplish important things by demonstrating its strength in the governance process. \n\nFinally, we are unaware of the existence of a native project born within the community, which has been under development for 7 months and has gone through two Bounties. Lucky enough to interview the founders of Polkadot and current developers, among other personalities, to then seek funding from the treasury with the same goals set out in this proposal.\n\n**Why not fund the project through a Bounty?**\n\n- The project has already participated in Wag Media's Bounty #12 and Creadores Web 3, it has managed to progress up to this level. Going back to a Bounty would be walking backwards in terms of natural evolution. \n\n- This project is about continuing to build a brand related to Polkadot & Kusama in Spanish, it is not just about content videos looking for a previously determined economic reward.\n\n- Not depend on others and continue to build our own reputation.\n\n- To have secured funds for a period of 6 months and a work schedule. The Bounty´s bags are usually out of stock before they are planned, due to the great demand and generation of content that they produce.\n\n- The content bounties were created precisely to incentivize and guide creators in their first steps within the ecosystem, therefore we believe that our product is not a good fit for them. It would be taking funds away from other potential creators in their first level of development.\n\n\n\nFull Proposal **[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xn8HvhyrBG0ktO433fp8LNvn7Xp5dyOH/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115896797857518580767&rtpof=true&sd=true)**.\n",

      "content": "[Original discussion started 6 days ago](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2539)\n\nProponent: G2VxaAzR3THxGPXmANM7EEDo17KtmTKiKEKXMTVEe9W8T1X\n\nDate: 06.04.2023\n\nRequested KSM: 1807 KSM / $60,800 paid after the approval. The price was calculated using the EMA7 rate on Subscan.\n\nImpulse DAO is a developers' DAO focused on creating a thriving ecosystem for on-chain WebAssembly (WASM) games and games for developers by leveraging Gear and ink! smart contracts. The project aims to address the limited number of WASM developers in the Web3 and Polkadot/Kusama community, showcase the capabilities of WASM smart contracts, and inspire developers to explore the untapped potential of 100% on-chain games.\n\nOver the course of three months, Impulse DAO will fund and support five teams to build fully-functioning dApps, featuring WASM smart contracts, front-end, and design. All project components will be open-source. Impulse DAO will also host online and offline WASM tournaments for developers, engaging the Rust developers community and providing a competitive and gamified learning experience.\n\n\n## Problem\n\n- a small community of WASM developers concentrated within Parity, Gear, Astar, and Supercolony teams;\n- lack of products that showcase the difference between EVM & WASM virtual machines.\n\n[Read more\n](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idmqemlqypn42UBI3uoNjY44yIDYn_SEdDV2bhZW0pI/edit#heading=h.vchj23z966kb)\n## Available solutions\n\n- Bounty #19. The existing bounty is focused only on ink! smart contracts. While Impulse DAO aims to support both Gear & ink! smart contracts for growing the Polkadot/Kusama WASM ecosystem.\n\n## Proposed solution\n\nGames for developers can be considered a solution to the stated problem because they offer an engaging and competitive way to learn and explore the capabilities of WASM smart contracts. By creating a gamified learning environment, these games can attract more developers to the Kusama ecosystem, showcasing the advantages of WASM smart contracts compared to EVM, and ultimately contribute to the growth of the developer community. This approach not only helps address the current shortage of WASM developers but also encourages the development of new tools, resources, and innovative on-chain gaming experiences, thereby demonstrating the potential and versatility of the Kusama network.\n\n## Scope of work\n\n- RnD ink! contracts\n- Validate hypotheses through [JBTD interviews](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done).\n- Find builders\n\n[Read more](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idmqemlqypn42UBI3uoNjY44yIDYn_SEdDV2bhZW0pI/edit#heading=h.kvr5owy65mfa)\n## Examples of games for developers\n\n[100% on-chain WASM game for developers](https://github.com/tmcgroul/AArena) made by Impulse DAO core members.\n\n[100% on-chain game made for a hackathon](https://mirror.xyz/0x67297B20204d49D15e2da00483c4ad6fFB67b813/wy0PGiStS-E5_eb792lGjm3VDqPvNNez6N_ywojXeTM)\n\n## Deliverables\n\n5 WASM 100% on-chain games for developers:\n\n- Gear;\n- AlephZero;\n- Astar;\n- Polkadot/Kusama community choice;\n- DAO choice.\n\nFinal report that includes:\n\n- Learning outcomes;\n- Hypothesis verification;\n- Overview of projects built by grantees;\n- Online tournament results.\n\n## Success criteria\n\n20+ engaged developers — players;\n\nPlayers contribute user-generated-logic for enhancing gameplay;\n\n40-60 learning-outcome survey respondents;\n\n40+ participants in the tournament;\n\n[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1idmqemlqypn42UBI3uoNjY44yIDYn_SEdDV2bhZW0pI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

These public projects enable the parachain teams and teams within their ecosystem to increase the data indexing speed of their SubQuery projects by up to 10 times.\n\n**Raw Data:** <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17829KgXp5aXKXkaPw7A7oCgjMBB8vEuCg2Pyk1MGQnY/edit#gid=0>\n\n**Full Proposal:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nOriginal Motivation\n===================================\n\nSubQuery is the universal data indexing toolkit facilitating the construction of Web3 applications of the future. A SubQuery project is a complete API to organise and query data from Layer-1 chains. Currently servicing Polkadot, Kusama, and other layer-1 chains in Substrate, Avalanche, Algorand, Terra, NEAR, and Cosmos projects, we provide data for developers to use for a wide array of projects (wallets, explorers, custom chains, or any other decentralised app). In the future, the SubQuery Network intends to replicate this scalable and reliable solution in a completely decentralised manner.\n\nThroughout the whole of 2022 (01/01/2022 - 31/12/2022) we've provided public SubQuery Projects, termed Dictionaries, for most parachains in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem to dramatically increase indexing performance (up to 10x faster) and so far these dictionaries have served over 1 billion requests.\n\nA SubQuery dictionary is a special SubQuery Project which scans over the network, and records metadata of every event and extrinsic on each block. When other SubQuery projects index data on any of these chains, they can ask the dictionary what blocks a filtered list of events/intrinsics appear on. Rather than having to search through each block, dictionaries reduce the amount of data that the indexer obtains from the chain, reduces load on free RPC endpoints across the ecosystem, and reduces the number of \"unwanted\" blocks stored in the local buffer. For example, instead of SubQuery inspecting each block of Polkadot's massive chain (600GB of unstructured data on over 12 million blocks) which can take many hours, dictionaries skip through to the exact right blocks.\n\nAdding the dictionary  to optimise indexing performance is as easy as adding the relevant network dictionary endpoint to your SubQuery Project. This has been added by default to all of our starter projects to make it default to use.\n\nHere you can find detailed documentation on how dictionaries work: <https://academy.subquery.network/academy/tutorials_examples/dictionary.html#>\n\nSubQuery Dictionaries have been created for most parachains to the public here <https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary> and have been deployed to our Managed Service. If any other team would like a dictionary created - we are more than happy to help out.\n\nFuture Targets for Our Dictionaries\n===================================\n\n-   We're proud of our record on stability and reliability. One of our core values is to be blockchain's most reliable indexer, and we don't intend to lose sight of this as we onboard more chains and expand the number of customers relying on our hosted service for their production applications. Our goal for 2023 is 99.99% uptime, we're starting off strong with 100% so far as seen [here](https://status.subquery.network/uptime/f3j5qtmn4rhd).\n\n-   Through 2022 we ran 24 dictionaries for the in-demand parachains that we believed would add most value to the dApp developers in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Moving forward we want to be able to offer the increased indexing performance to all active block-producing parachains, our goal will be to add 20 more dictionaries to our suite of tools in 2023.\n\n-   Being on the cusp of 1 billion requests to our dictionaries in 2022 has left us hungry to smash records in 2023. This year, with the launch of our decentralised SubQuery Network and ongoing Business Development efforts, we are looking to hit (and surpass) a target of 10 billion requests to our dictionaries.\n\nGithub Contributors. Our [dictionaries are completely open source](https://github.com/subquery/subql-dictionary), and SubQuery is a community project with a goal of complete decentralisation. Already last year, we welcomed contributions to our dictionaries from developers at Nodle and Subscan. We are working on making it easier for new parachains to assist us with creating dictionaries.\n\n--\n\n**Full Proposal Found Here:** [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18lOrE_O8C6oDswYamIYHDUAw2V-R-HwoW9YnujQxFfw/edit?usp=sharing)",

      "title": "Treasury Proposal - Substrate in Bits",
      "content": "**Dear community,**\n\n\nWith the aim of supporting ecosystem developers, I'm presenting this treasury proposal for \"Substrate in Bits\", a series of in-depth technical content focused on addressing the pain points of developers building with Substrate. \n\nThis proposal has been up for discussion for **9 days** [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2530)\n\nThe goal is to provide valuable and comprehensive resources that can help developers understand their code better as well as serve as a trusted reference for developers seeking to gain an in-depth understanding of how their codes work.\n\nEach article in the series will be written with the goal of providing detailed information and practical examples with the ultimate goal of serving as a trusted reference for the common problems logged on Substrate media platforms like the StackExchange, Polkadot Discord server, Substrate Matrix channel, etc.\nBy breaking down complex Substrate concepts into “bits” that are easy to understand and implement, we aim to make it easy for developers to gain a deeper understanding of their code and be able to make proper changes when things go wrong. \n\n<br>**Substrate in Bits**</br>\n\n<br>**Problem:**</br>\n- The depth and specificity of community-created content needs to be improved.\n- The developer community needs more reference resources that target specific pain points of developers.\n- The ecosystem needs more community-curated technical content that can easily evolve over time by  eventually leveraging the expertise and contributions of a diverse community of engineers.\n\n[Jump to the Problem section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.rtx22oudlknz)\n\n<br>**Available solutions**</br>\n\nThere are some existing solutions for substrate-related resources (Including the Substrate documentation and Blockchain training Alliance course) and some are in the works (eg, Polkadot.study). But a key different between \"Substrate in Bits\" and these solutions is that the technical content in “Substrate in Bits” are not designed to be specific courses. Instead, they’re designed to address specific issues often faced by developers. \n\nA key component of addressing these issues and creating technical content, is consulting with experts and getting their opinion (this is a core component of our research process). \n\n[Jump to available solutions section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.o7vbzgqhvmxu)\n\n\n\n<br>**Proposed solution**</br>\nThis proposal aims to tackle the existing problems by:\n- Creating technical content using a problem-based approach. The goal of these “Substrate in Bits” is to address common issues faced by substrate developers and go in-depth on why these problems arise and how to solve/avoid them. \n- Making technical content as collaborative as possible, allowing engineers from the community to make contributions and make Substrate in Bits an up-to-date and trusted reference for substrate developers. In order to achieve this, all our technical content will be housed on GitHub. This will make it easy for interested contributors to contribute to improving these pieces of content in the future.\n\nBy compiling these information in one easily accessible location, developers can more quickly and effectively troubleshoot their code and gain a deeper understanding of Substrate's technical components.\n\nThis will not only save developers time and effort but making the content open-source on Github contribute to the growth and success of the Substrate ecosystem by encouraging greater participation and collaboration.\n\n[Jump to the Proposed solution section of the Proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.4zgqeocu4ug5)\n\n\n\n<br>**Scope of work and Deliverables**</br>\nThe key deliverable for this proposal is 40 pieces of \"Substrate in Bits\" content. Priorities will ultimately be given to issues that are logged more often on substrate channels and the stackexchange and have less available solutions. These pieces of content will be housed on Github\n\nOther efforts that are not part of the key deliverable include:\n- Monthly analytics of our content and the living survey to gauge impact\n- Efforts at bringing \"Substrate in Bits\" into the limelight of developers\n- Running a \"Substrate in Bits\" channels where developers can brainstorm on \"Substrate in Bits\" content\n\n[Jump to the Key deliverables section of the proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.z2q1mv7r6x4g)\n\n\n\n<br>**Key success criteria**</br>\n- Developer reach: \n     - Target: 100\n- Percentage of developers that participated at least once in our living survey\n     - Target: 30% - 50%\n- Developers’ perception of our content\n    - Target: >70% of readers should find our content to be helpful and satisfactory\n\n[Jump to the success criteria section of the proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit#bookmark=id.wxgz8ueb2o7u)\n\n\n<br>You can find the full information in the [proposal document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4wgb2uEk7Uy77XwaKtM-L6NMlZFB0wIH7hb4U4VVyM/edit?usp=sharing)</br>\n\n\nOriginal discussion can be found [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2530)\n",

      "title": "Parachain Assets Fiat Onramp Support Bounty Program",
      "content": "Dear Kusama community,\n\nThis is Zhixi Zhang from [Interlay](https://interlay.io). We propose a bounty program aimed at helping Kusama parachains integrate fiat on-ramp support for their native assets with [Banxa](https://banxa.com/), one of the leading providers in the space. \n**Please visit discussion post regarding this bounty via this [link](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2513).**\n\nCurrently, acquiring native parachain tokens has been identified as a significant obstacle for new users in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, and many parachains are seeking solutions to incorporate an on-ramp service. However, integrating on-ramp services can be challenging for parachains due to high costs and extensive liquidity requirements. Meanwhile, in order to integrate parachain tokens, service providers face barriers such as limited token volume and restricted exposure to DeFi solutions.\n\nAfter conducting extensive research and interviews with various on-and-off-ramp service providers, along with numerous conversations with different projects in the ecosystem, we decided to work with [Banxa](https://banxa.com/), a leading payment service provider, to bring to you a bounty program that aims to provide an affordable on-ramp service tailored for Polkadot and Kusama assets.\n\nThis bounty program is intended to help as many parachains as possible in establishing easy and secure solutions for native token on-ramp, thereby improving the user acquisition process for the ecosystem as a whole. Please take a look at the full bounty proposal, we would love to hear what you think!\n\n[**Link to full proposal**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD-PcPPmhTNuejSvo4hezlZy66h2oBWo71Uv3XCn0D4/edit?usp=sharing) \n\n\n**Bounty Cost: $10 500 per parachain**\n\n**Bounty coverage:**\n\n- Parachain + native asset support for 9 Kusama parachains: $10 500 for each parachain support with one parachain native asset onramp support\n- Statemine support + Onramp support for Kusama native USD Stablecoins* +KSM: $10 500\n\n**Total requested budget: $105 000 USD of KSM**\n\n*Note: Native USDT onramp support is now available on Statemine and can be integrated. Onramp support for USDC and other stablecoins will be added once liquidity channels are in place.",

      "content": "**Update**\n\nI've been reading that a lot of people are voting against this proposal out of concern about the conflict of interest that curating the bounty might cause. So until that issue is resolved, I decide to remove this proposal.\n\nIn general and for the entire community, I would like to emphasize that when there are doubts with as much weight as this one, it would be good to be able to resolve them in the discussion, which is its objective.\n\n___________________________\nShort description: This proposal aims to fund the translation and dubbing costs of “Sub0, the Polkadot Developer Conference” 2022 playlist into Spanish. The deadline for submitting the proposal is 5 months from its approval.\n\nHi! I'm Sara and for some time I decided to combine two of my passions, \"web3\" and language, to create the YouTube channel [Polkadot y Kusama - Doblaje al Español](https://www.youtube.com/@DotsamaES) with the aim that the Spanish-speaking community has access to the official content of the ecosystem Dotsama and its new technology in Spanish. I've been working on the YT channel and contributing to the ecosystem since December 2021. I've worked on videos like the [Polkadot Behind the Code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Vbwe7WWl9TvtU0ECvMRAjjcG-nhAYyu) series, as well as dubbing the entire [Polkadot Decoded 2022](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2Vbwe7WWl9Rwp6ZYcVI6BgzJkFXSS9dG) playlist, funded by Kusama's Treasury and successfully completed as you can see [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/206).\n\nDubbing of [Sub0 Polkadot Developer Conference playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyWqupZ-WGvywLqJDsMIYdCn8QEa2ShQ) that has 24 hours of technical talks and interactive workshops to understand everything from building blockchains with Substrate to EVM and Wasm smart contracts, interoperability, trustless bridges, and building with Rust.\n\nThese videos will allow the Polkadot developer community and interested people to find out why builders are choosing Polkadot as the home of Web3. Also Sub0 event offered attendees avenues to deepen their skills, network, and explore career opportunities in blockchain’s second most active developer community. For the work proposed in this proposal we will be a team of 3 community members: 2 translators and an editor. The working team is detailed at point 6 of the proposal.\n\nThese videos will be accessible to any user through the [Polkadot y Kusama - Doblaje al español](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdhalsQc7NrYCvYkietak7A) channel, and will be available for any member to share through other channels and/or platforms (such as [Polkadot Hub](https://polkadotespanol.com/) or the [Polkadot en Español](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCARL1JqRrFN0x4jCcd87Aew) channel on YouTube).\n\nYou can read the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LEtKv9SArpaQkoEkWzEGtq6TO0YQKJ0HpBdXJhCPZ5U/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nYou can find the original post discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2467).",

      "content": "Dear community,\n<br/><br/>\nThis proposal seeks to fund collators of the `Statemine` network for the duration of `6 months` as a pilot.  If passed, a Collator will receive a `performance based`, fixed fiat reward of `USD$300.00` per month as well a one time `reimbursement` for work previously provided.  The proposal document was presented to current System Collators as well as Joe (W3F) and Zoltan (Encointer) to their satisfaction.\n<br/>\nAdditionally, I am taking the opportunity to test assigning a Curator to the bounty within the same proposal as approving it.  This is usually undertaken as a separate process because the bounty needs to be approved before it can be assigned a Curator.  Let's see how this goes, no time would be lost due to this experiment.  \n<br/>\nThe Curators are namely:\n\n- FrankyWild (`frankywild#8573`)\n- Tim Jansen (`Tim Janssen (Won't DM)#8682`)\n- Husni (`pastaMan#9738`)\n\nThese individuals are members of the Moderation and Anti-scam teams and also have experience with bounty curation.  They have also met the requirements as described within section 5.2 of the proposal.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n**Summary:**\n\n>A System Parachain (S.C.) is defined as any Parachain which attained its lease via governance.  This proposal aims to establish a framework for Collators on System Parachains to minimise censorship, maintain liveliness and incentivise efficient performance.  <br/>\n> \n> It attempts to achieve this by suggesting parameters for the selection, incentivisation and the ideal number of Collators on System Parachains.  It is also anticipated that this framework would form a standard that would aid future System Parachains as they are deployed. <br/>\n> \n> As a medium term solution, 1,873.69 KSM is requested to fund a bounty to incentivise Collators on the Statemine network for six (6) months.  This would be used as a pilot test and re-evaluated before further funding is provided.\n\n<br/>\n\n**Full proposal**\n\nThe full proposal can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H2T1Nx90HkSAYF_CaOPLG-o3LS7h_QAa2WLDdcSJMs0/edit?usp=sharing).  \n\n<br/>\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe proposal was left for [open discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2427) for a duration of two weeks and received only one item of feedback.\n\n\n<br/><br/>\nRegards,<br/>\nWill | Paradox",

      "content": "### General Project Information\n\n**Short description**: Subledgr is a platform for multi-token fund management, accounting & reporting (Phase 1)\n\n**Project Category / Type**:\n- Software development (applications, tools)\n- Miscellaneous (research, services)\n\n\n**Proponent**: derek // metaspan.com\n\n**KSM address:** HyLisujX7Cr6D7xzb6qadFdedLt8hmArB6ZVGJ6xsCUHqmx METASPAN\n\n**Requested allocation**: 1,430 KSM (~£50k @ £35/KSM 21-Feb-2023, EMA7 for KSM/USD, EMA7 for USD/GBP, ref. Budget section for full details)\n\n**Discussion date**: 31 Jan 2023 (discussion)\n\n### Problem Statement\n\n- **Multi-chain, multi-account** - Most users hold and manage tokens across multiple chains, and use different accounts for custody and control (e.g. stash & controller for staking/nomination). Account holders & fund managers do not have affordable tools focused on financial management, reporting and planning.\n\n- **New processes** - Fund and Grant Management is a niche area requiring specialist attention. Managing a fund-in-a-fund is common practice, and we need a toolset to support this.\n\\\nGovernance processes are evolving fast, with new features and capabilities being added all the time. We need aggregated tracking and accounting for funds locked in validating, staking, nomination pools, lending & governance processes (proposal, bounty, childBounty).\n\n- **Lagging tools slow adoption** - Users are mostly dependent on web2 tools and spreadsheets for financial management and reporting. These tools are focused on fiat with 2-decimal computation & reporting.\n\n- **Affordability** - Existing crypto accounting tools are charging large fees.\n\n- **Parachains** - None of the existing solutions cater for parachains.\n\n### Proposal\n\nThe goal of the project is to create easy-to-use tools for managing & reporting - in aggregate - across multiple chains and tokens.\n\nSubledgr would like to develop a quickbooks style accounting & reporting platform that can be tied-in with third party vendor tools for the purposes of tax calculation and compliance.\n\nSubledgr would also provide portfolio management and reporting features for working with multiple chains and accounts. We are inspired [and frustrated] by similar features from quickbooks/xero for web2 SME businesses. Following a style that is familiar to web2 users, this site will drive adoption of substrate-based tokens by making it easy to manage groups of wallets as a single fund.\n\n### Key deliverables\n\n- The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Phase 1 of Subledgr's roadmap includes the following features:\nReport on all transactions/extrinsics: Subledgr will provide a report on all transactions and extrinsics that have occurred on the blockchain, giving users a complete view of their cryptocurrency activities.\n\n- Categories: Transactions such as transfers between accounts, staking rewards, bond amounts, and fees will be allocated based on the user’s defined Chart of Accounts. This will help users better understand and analyse their cryptocurrency activities.\n\n- Categorisation - the basic feature that enables “bank” reconciliation and subsequent reporting \n\n- Profit & Loss: Subledgr will produce a Profit & Loss report for a specified period (e.g. week, month, year), including information on the movement of tokens earned and spent, as well as changes in exchange rates (e.g. GBP/USD).\n\n- Exchange rates: integration with an oracle for exchange rates\n\n- Export to CSV/spreadsheet: Subledgr will allow users to export their data to a CSV or spreadsheet format. This will provide a basis for any tax reporting or other financial analysis.\n\n### Success Criteria\n\nA user of the system will be able to execute the following processes:\n- Login, User management & password recovery\n- Create portfolio(s)\n- Add accounts to a portfolio\n- Review all transactions for the accounts from chain / indexer\n- Allocate transactions and fees to categories\n- Report on\n  - Fund (Portfolio) Value\n- Extract transactions to CSV\n\n### Additional info\n\\\n==> see original polkassembly posting and discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2413)\n\\\n==> LINK TO FULL PROPOSAL [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15F79YMx5B5qGB3N8AlPD9r7UYW4WcH-AECFNIb6BmnA/edit#heading=h.d1jf1dgpau8)\n",

With the launch of OpenGov we are now looking to extend the dashboard to also include all relevant data from this new governance system.\n\n<br>\n\n---------\n\n<br>\n\nWe are asking for a total of **31.889 €** for the undertaking. \n\nThrough our [last proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/54) we have been overpaid 4.160 € (due to KSM price increasing during voting period) which we discounted in this proposal. We will only be asking for 70% of the funds up front and 30% after completion to ensure accountability on our part.\n\n**31.889 € - 4.160 € = 27.729 €**\n\n<br>\n\n---------\n\n<br>\n\n\n<h3>Asking amounts of each proposal:</h3>\n\n**Up-front** payment through **proposal 1**: 27.729 € * 0,7 = 19.410 € => 669 KSM (10% price buffer)\n\n**Post-delivery** payment through **proposal 2**: 27.729 € * 0,3 = 8.319 €\n\n<br>\n\n---------\n\n<br>\n\nAny excess funds (due to a KSM price increase between referenda creation and payout) will be paid back to the treasury! This includes the price buffer of course.\n\nYou can find the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZRdGw7-sE0um9DjpMFdUjqW4soU4hLD_MO2nU9xroE/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nView the original discussion post [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2405).\n\n",

We must educate a generation of users who are passionate about sharing their knowledge and insights in order to establish this new paradigm in content creation.\n\nWe must totally distinguish our methodology from the way of working of influencers and marketing agencies, which always end up influencing the message and objective of the content generated by the creators they support, resulting in pieces with commercial or speculative claims.\n\nWith the work carried out by Creadores Web3 and all similar groups in this early stage of the ecosystem, in addition to rewarding with tips the generation of valuable content by users who carry out this activity more sporadically, we must prepare users and teams who want to formalize a personal brand or a brand of a podcast, informative website, etc. so that they can be truly competitive, learn how to define their content series and how to give them visibility.\n\nHere is the link to the **[full version of the proposal in english](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GoOflWHmQER-luWqQ29mw6JRbaINerV9/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111991717794509596698&rtpof=true&sd=true)** \n\nLink to **[Proposal Discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2156)**\n\n**[Creadores Web3 activity report\n](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189_GKlV7tDzVuRQI6WGQ_8oIiyhxoEZb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111991717794509596698&rtpof=true&sd=true)** (02/08/2022 - 02/12/2022)\n\n**Spanish**\n\nEsta propuesta de 6 meses es para renovar el financiamiento de Creadores Web3, un grupo de creadores de contenido y usuarios de la comunidad de habla hispana formado en WagMedia bajo Bounty 12.\n\nExiste una necesidad real de formar y educar a una generación de creadores de contenido competitivos que sean usuarios nativos del ecosistema de Polkadot y Kusama.\n\nCon esta propuesta nuestro objetivo principal no es sólo continuar revisando y recompensando la creación de contenido de valor para la comunidad.\n\nNo debemos pagar por la generación de \"un número X de piezas de contenido\", si no usar los recursos otorgados a esta iniciativa, y todas las similares, para educar a una generación de creadores, usuarios reales de esta tecnología, que puedan ser competitivos en las plataformas que operan, todo mientras siguen generando un contenido de valor para el futuro del ecosistema.\n\nLa labor realizada por estas iniciativas y lo que supone toda esta nueva forma de financiación para la creación de contenido debe consolidarse. Debemos educar a una generación de usuarios apasionados por compartir su conocimiento y puntos de vista para así establecer este nuevo paradigma en la creación de contenido. \n\nDebemos distinguir nuestra metodología totalmente con la forma de trabajar de las agencias de influencers y marketing, las cuales siempre acaban influyendo en el mensaje y objetivo del contenido generado por los creadores que amparan resultando en piezas con pretensiones comerciales o especulativas.\n\nCon el trabajo realizado por Creadores Web3 y todos los grupos similares en este estado temprano del ecosistema, además de recompensar con tips la generación de contenido de valor por usuarios que realizan esta actividad de forma más esporádica, debemos preparar a usuarios y equipos que quieran formalizar una marca personal o una marca de un podcast, web informativa, etc. para que ellos puedan ser competitivos de verdad, aprendan a definir sus series de contenido y cómo darles visibilidad. \n\nAquí tenéis el enlace a la **[versión completa de la propuesta en español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OPA5TsnHAuHh-7oVxzwQoYxKIAJx17b4/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111991717794509596698&rtpof=true&sd=true).**\n\nA continuación tenéis un vídeo donde explicamos algunos de los puntos más importantes de esta propuesta: \n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8BMAJwfbjI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

      "title": "Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Feb-23 to Apr-23",
      "content": "We'd like to fund maintenance of the [substrate-api-client](https://github.com/scs/substrate-api-client) from February 2023 until April 2023. This is a continuation of the [Treasury Proposal: Maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov-22 to Jan-23](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26).\n\nThe substrate-api-client is a Rust-library for connecting to a substrate-based node via RPC. It is an alternative to subxt, which provides a similar functionality. RPC clients are needed in any software component, connecting to a substrate parachain. Therefore it is advisable, that there is more than one client available for Rust developers. Apart from that, the substrate-api-client fills a gap, providing the possibility to create extrinsics in a no_std-environment. Thereby facilitating extrinsic creation from within trusted hardware (like Intel sgx). This has a big potential for further usage in IoT environments. Last but not least, the substrate-api-client has an easy-to-use interface and comes with many practical examples, which makes it a good option for new developers.\n\nThis proposal is a follow-up of the treasury proposal [maintenance for the substrate-api-client Nov22 - Jan 23](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/26). View our [report](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/26#cbace6d7-a2aa-4053-b9a3-9ba948f151e2) for details on our work there. We aim to seek ongoing funding. At the current stage, we want to work on improvements of the existing functionality and providing examples for using the client in different use cases. Furthermore, we want to start the implementation of a cli-wallet with password encrypted keystore.\n\nSee the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2159) and our [full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A25Sq4tr3HXB6WUj5vJP0EhC9enGZraGLh8CQpoB7GQ/edit?usp=sharing) for details.",

      "content": "##### Hello everyone!\n\nThis proposal aims to continue the work of the Poltuguese Content Guild, (previously called Portuguese Unit), which has been funded to date by Bounty 12.\n\nWe will continue the work we have done so far. From this proposal, the focus of the Poltuguese Content Guild will be on producing original content, something that gives more value to the content producer, creates authority and brand recognition.\n\nHere is the full proposal, it is in two languages, [Portuguese](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RTV8KsLIDzs7qWXTf4Iyqr7wvtffMrJo1fH99ck8fU0/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1) and[ English](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CgYvcCT4WdhYPYMHB5qehDY4j9gTDIw94qqN9mtqwA8/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1).\n\n[Here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2125) is the discussion about this proposal.\n\nI made some changes to the original proposal, as suggested by some feedbacks received. I lowered the funding proposal from 6 months to 4 and added spreadsheets with all the content produced by the team, along with the rewards for content.\n________________________________\n\n##### Olá a todos!\n\nEsta proposta visa dar continuidade ao trabalho da Guilda de Conteúdo Poltuguês, (anteriormente chamada de Unidade Portuguesa), que foi financiada até o momento pelo Bounty 12.\n\nIremos dar continuidade ao trabalho que fizemos até hoje. A partir desta proposta, o foco da Guilda Poltuguês será a produção de conteúdo original, algo que dá mais valor ao produtor de conteúdo, cria autoridade e reconhecimento de sua marca.\n\nAqui está a proposta completa, ela se encontra em dois idiomas, [Português](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RTV8KsLIDzs7qWXTf4Iyqr7wvtffMrJo1fH99ck8fU0/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1) e [Inglês](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CgYvcCT4WdhYPYMHB5qehDY4j9gTDIw94qqN9mtqwA8/edit#heading=h.v6is2ta0txr1).\n\n[Aqui](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2125) esta a discussão sobre esta proposta.\n\nFiz algumas alterações na proposta original, conforme sugerido por alguns feedbacks recebidos.\nBaixei a proposta de financiamento de 6 meses para 4 e adicionei tabelas com todo o conteúdo produzido pela equipe, juntamente com as recompensas pelos conteúdos.\n\n",

Polkassembly successfully launched the governance v2 [dashboard](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/gov-2) on the same date allowing the community to start participating in the new truly decentralized governance..\n\nAs of 18th January, 72 referendums have been created across various tracks. We recently witnessed the power of OpenGov when two governance bodies voted in a simultaneous and coordinated way to approve an on-chain proposal and help improve the overall network.\n\nThe proposal is intended to fund the expenses made while development of OpenGov.\nThe milestones & respective costs include all the necessary product, research, development, design and management work to reach the defined goals. Read the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWOiKBG_lARiy0EXDATxvt0htJ_N_LmtOnzirutAvns/edit?usp=sharing).\nWe are also excited to see how OpenGov improves on-chain governance for the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem while inspiring other blockchains to learn and adapt to such governance models.\n\nProposer: Polkassembly\n\nProponent: F1wAMxpzvjWCpsnbUMamgKfqFM7LRvNdkcQ44STkeVbemEZ\n\nCost: $92,210 - 3238 KSM.\n\nFull Proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vWOiKBG_lARiy0EXDATxvt0htJ_N_LmtOnzirutAvns/edit?usp=sharing\nDiscussion Post: https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2150\n\n",

      "title": "Governance 2.0 Referenda Audits",
      "content": "Dear community,\n\nBased on the recent experience with the increasing number of treasury proposals, I am presenting the following proposal aiming to improve the Governance 2.0 experience through a series of referenda proposal audits.\n\n[The original discussion.](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2138)\n\n**Governance 2.0 Referenda Audits**\n\n**1. Problem**\n\nSince the launch of Governance 2.0 on Kusama I spent many hours reading, reviewing, and trying to understand many treasury discussions and proposals. I try my best to understand every proposal before forming an opinion and voting. For the majority of the proposals, I try to provide feedback to the proposer explaining the reasons for either supporting or rejecting the proposal. So far I feel like proposals are sort of a wild game at the moment.\n\nMost proposals are not very well structured, lack information, and include budgets that seem very hard to defend. Proposals can also be very diverse with a focus on different areas that not everyone can be familiar with. For all these reasons it is significantly time-consuming for voters to truly understand the proposal and cast an educated vote on it.\n\nWith the given time constraints, it is not surprising that proposals are receiving very little or no feedback at all. The feedback is often provided in a free form and is not always clear and precise. Such insufficient information has little use for other voters. It provides low assurance to other community members that the reviewer has objectively formed an objective opinion on the presented proposals.\n\n**2. Available solutions**\n\nThe official Polkadot treasury page, Kusama and Polkadot Wiki provide a good source of information and documentation. Most of this information and guidelines explain the “old” Governance 1.0 system or in other words, it relates to the very specific set of proposal reviewers – Councilors. With the Governance 2.0 introduction, the set of reviewers dramatically increased from a limited set of councilors to a much wider Dotsama community. For this reason, all the documentation needs to be adjusted so it can be better presented to the wider audience where not everyone needs to be an expert in the field to have a good understanding of the proposal content.\n\n**3. Proposal Solution**\n\nThis proposal aims to create a clear and precise framework for creating and presenting the proposals. This framework is not meant to be a strict requirement but more as a set of guidelines for the proposers to successfully present their project and increase their chance to defend the proposal and win community approval.\n\nAs the counterpart to the proposal framework, the equally important audit framework will be created as guidance for the reviewers. This audit aims to provide more precise feedback to the proposer and give a sufficient and educated review that can be later used by other voters to form their opinion on the proposal.\n\nIn a young system like this, creating these guidelines is simply not enough. To create a better treasury proposal system, a great level of engagement is required. For this reason, I propose a temporary Project manager/auditor role for a period of 3 months. The main task of the PM is to actively follow the governance tracks, objectively check and audit the proposal content according to the proposal guidelines and produce and publish the audit according to the created framework. The task of the PM is to be available to the community and gather feedback and accordingly adjust the framework.\n\n**4. Key deliverables:**\n\nProposal template – a document with predefined categories and as many pre-filled and guided data (examples) as possible.\n\nFeedback template – directly related to the proposal template. Possible checklist for each category with additional room for the feedback\n\nProduce a minimum of 30 one-page audits with included feedback on active treasury proposals or proposal discussions\n\n**5. Key objectives/ Success criteria**\n\nReduce the time required to write a detailed and comprehensive proposal – measured by the proposal owner's feedback\n\nHigher community involvement in the governance – measured by the number of members involved in discussions, number of provided feedback, and number of interactions with one-page reviews\n\nAll these points are taken from the full proposal document.\n\n[Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Ze8Z_f9Pa3kjALGnhu-58DNdajFQ74ONbuDeWcaFoU/edit#heading=h.5x0d5h95i329)\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hello everyone in DotSama community, happy new year! \n\nThis is DrCAO, I am Ex. community manager at Parallel Finance and Para Space, and also director of Chinese community in WagMedia under Bounty 12. I'm a long-term supporter of DotSama, and I'm also active in supporting many other parachains in Dotsama project. This is my first proposal in Web3 in my whole life, and I am full of excitement and nervousness.\n\nMy first proposal to build AIWeb3 Chinese community unit. The mission of the AiWeb3 Chinese community is to continue building the community to support the Chinese content creators to focus on content creation in Dotsama, build connections for different parachain projects, and provide the latest information in Dotsama. The Chinese content creators can focus on researching and generating high-quality content, including dubbing, translating and also original content in Dotsama. In addition, we will put more resources into supporting the early-stage content creators so that they can build up the audience and brand.\n\nI have modified the original proposal based on the feedback from the community, and you can see the community discussion of the proposal here: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095). \n\n**The discussion posted on Jan. 2 received very positive feedback with 13 likes and 0 unlikes, we really appreciate your support on this proposal!  I would love to get feedback from the community so that I can come up with the best proposal, and I'd be happy to answer any questions and tweak the proposal as needed!**\n\nDotSama社区的各位，祝大家新年好！\n\n我是DrCao—— 我之前在 Parallel Finance 和 Para Space 担任社区经理，同时也是WagMedia里Bounty 12的中文社区负责人，我是DotSama的长期支持者，并且也很活跃的支持 Dotsama 中的许多其他平行链项目。这是我第一次在Web3中发起提案，有一些激动和紧张。\n\n这是我的第一个提案，建立一个“爱Web3中文社区”，爱Web3中文社区的使命是继续建设Dotsama社区，支持中文内容创作者专注于 Dotsama 的内容创作，为不同的平行链项目建立联系，并提供 Dotsama 的最新信息。中国内容创作者可以专注于研究和生产高质量的内容，包括在 Dotsama 中的配音、翻译和原创内容。此外，我们将投入更多资源支持早期的内容创作者，让他们建立受众和品牌。\n\n根据社区的反馈，我已经改进了原先的提案，你们可以到这查看社区的讨论和反馈: [https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2095)\n\n这个提案的讨论在1月2号发布，收到了很正面的回馈，有13个likes，0个unlike，非常感谢大家对这个提案的支持！",

This proposal supersedes the proposal made with governance 1.0 = https://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/246 . Further we added another 6.66 KSM due to an issue with u128 conversion for the requested amount in Polkadot JS. \n\n**Previous proposal**:\n\nhttps://kusama.polkassembly.io/treasury/171\n\nhttps://polkadot.polkassembly.io/treasury/134\n\n# Motivation\nArchives are an important piece of Polkadot and Kusama data infrastructure provided by Subsquid. They provide access to on-chain data in GraphQL format for all major parachains on Kusama and Polkadot, with more chains getting support as the ecosystem grows. They are being used as a data source for Squids and for efficient data exploration and ad-hoc queries. An up-to-date list of Archives is kept in a public Archive Registry\n# Achievements\nAt the end of Q2 Subsquid released a new generation of Archives, together with a major version of the SDK, both code named “Fire Squid”.\nThe improvements brought by this release include:\n- Substantial performance increase, with the ability to deploy a new Archive for a chain as big as Kusama, and the indexing to be ready in roughly a day\n- Fire Squid Archives support batch requests, which lead to a hundredfold increase in performance of indexing project connecting to them (squids)\n- Fire Squid Archives expose two separate gateways, configured and tuned for different uses (one for data exploration by humans, the other one specifically for programmatic and batch access)\n- Fire Squid Archives “unwrap” proxy, sudo and batch calls, tracing the origin, but making them much easier to access them\nSubsquid has also engaged in continuously improving the product, iteratively working on adding features, such as EVM Transactions indexing, and subscriptions to queries in the Graphql endpoints of indexing projects created with the Subsquid SDK (commonly called squids).\n# Statistics\nBetween 2022-09-03 (when tracking has started) and 2022-09-30 Subsquid’s Archive infrastructure has collectively:\n- Served a total of 129,468,038.2 (~129 million) queries in the month of September alone\n- Our 7 day average peaks above 5 million queries and adjusts around 3.3 million queries per day at the end of the period\nData from the month of October confirms the linear trend, allowing us to make assumptions for the months of July and August, given the steady growth of queries over time shown.\n\nFull report [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQji6zUckBRq3Q8H0xOSLjmFDUkKHckt9SiSIIMdCw_Ck_qpiAhFltGxnNavCmFJcebiBznKO_dleis/pub)",

      "title": "Polkadot Insider - Production of Dotsama ecosystem contents [NEW PROPOSAL]",
      "content": "Polkadot Insider is a media site that emphasizes on researching, creating insightful, educational contents of the Dotsama ecosystem, bringing HOTTEST news in the FASTEST ways, and the most important is to support projects built on Dotsama ecosystem to engage the community easier by creating marketing campaigns on Polkadot Insider.\n\nStarted from June, 2022, Polkadot Insider was created, and gained attention from Polkadot community on Twitter through our professionalized-simple content format, because we know the fact that, Twitter is the platform that people love to surf reading about cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, and a friendly content interface would easily catching their attention. The results is absolutely worth - until now December 2022, Polkadot Insider’s traffic is more than 1 million impressions per month. You can check out the [performance report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IDgIenmOBgLvcpDq_hhKp5jePqNrT6o7?usp=share_link) of the Polkadot Insider’s page.\n\nThe following proposal seeks funding for the production and development of Polkadot Insider in the next 4 months (from February 2023 to May 2023). This proposal is generated to officialize our contribution to the Dotsama ecosystem due to the last 6 months we seek a small amount of funding from separate projects to contribute directly to them.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to create a valuable media site for Dotsama that brings insightful content, fast news, and support promoting projects from different segments. Also, we intend to expand our work to the Youtube platform where we create an instructional library for users who love Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem!!\nMoreover, you can check again the [last discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2083) to have a better comparison. (I didn't clear the process so that I make new discussion)\nTo compare with the previous discussion, checking feedback from Raul, Kryptochain, Anaelle, and Polkadotter, there are some points I have updated:\n- Detailed 6 months' performance of our Twitter community in a very details report.\n- Detailed marketing strategy in the \"Outreach part\" of the full proposal.\n- In the last discussion, I called 148K for 6 months for maintaining our Twitter page, 60 How-to videos, 12 interview videos. In this new proposal, I adjusted down the cost to $61390 for 4 months for our Twitter page, 30 How-to videos, and 8 interview videos and manage a Crew3 community to get more potential users and enthusiasts on board (it would down 37,8% if we count on one month).\n- Audience target update: I updated our main target audience would be firstly in South Asia (when in my proposal mentioned about it more details).\n- Detailed Video plan that I would complete time by time.\n- Detailed budget distribution for each part.\n- Our official collaboration form for projects that have a campaign can contact us (we intend to diversify marketing campaigns for all projects have related to Dotsama with the same amount of content in terms of \"special campaigns\". \n- We'd expand time to deep-dive more amazing utilities to create content with this proposal as we mentioned in the documents, and Polkadot Insider daily would go higher than we did in the last period of time when we didn't have enough budget to invest enough time for it, still we got good results.\n- Lastly, we will start in February because we put it on chain in January.\n\n\nSome important documents: \n1. [Full proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZxVkqFmYMCbojl9ZLR9TC61DV4O9SDZhXlfIhz0PMu8/edit?usp=sharing)\n2. Full Treasury Proposal Spending [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1g2SRskVS-SirMFAj9wvZ2p75aa2TaGv7?usp=share_link) of Polkadot Insider\n3. [Public Report](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jW2nFwOFAi2QbTlaJnSP5WNzSb0a1kGm?usp=share_link) for the community to check our work (we'll update the report weekly for anyone who is interested in checking it, but the full report will release after the period of the funding request.\n4. Video Youtube [plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18lAiD1oTsJ1StuAE9ko9JdeHeN_QrzNkvi2L6h6ehgY/edit?usp=share_link)\n\nFinally, thanks for all the support and recommendation from all the wonderful people who commended the last discussion, especially those who support me to adjust this proposal in detail.\n\nWe will launch our full report from metric performance,  the community feedback and further strategy for the next phrase in the beginning of June. \n\nYou can check the discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2102)!",

      "title": "6 Month Funding of the Paraverse Content Creators",
      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nBounty 12 has evolved over the past few years into an impressive content generation machine that supports early-stage creators on their journey to becoming confident and independent stewards of the story of Polkadot and Kusama by incentivizing them with KSM rewards and sub-bounties. Now we're taking the next step forward. In an effort to decentralize even more, Directors of specific units will now completely and independently head their units while utilizing WagMedia's tools to further the growth of the creators incubating under their tutelage.\n\nThis proposal aims to continue the funding of the Paraverse Content Creators (previously General Unit in WagMedia) which supports creators who report on and create original content to help promote Polkadot and Kusama, especially content focused on parachains, the relay chains that secure them, governance, and general principles collectively held by the community. For greater than a year, creators within this group have generated content on the relay chains and nearly every parachain in the ecosystem. This content has been produced in many different formats including interviews with founders, long-form articles, Twitter threads, YouTube and TikTok videos, and more.\n\nThe tools and methods we use to evaluate and reward content have improved as well and you can [learn all about the proposal here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hhu6K0sMqlsND2rxCNmHj55zdc6ATRKm3KxOJbSmpPs/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nYou can see the community discussion of the proposal over the past week [with response to comments here.](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2089)\n\nWe appreciate your support and look forward to spreading the story of Polkadot and Kusama even further!

      "title": "Kusama Governance Dashboard",
      "content": "Dear Community,\n\nWe finally have a [governance dashboard](https://www.kusamagovernance.com/) (currently only includes gov1 data)!\n\nWhile the [Proof of Chaos](https://www.proofofchaos.app/) project aims to incentivise governance participation, until now there was no way to actually measure the impact of these efforts. We decided to build this dashboard since no alternatives were available and received treasury funding for the undertaking.\n\n*To align interests with a successful outcome and ensure delivery we only asked for approximately **half** (10500 Euros) of the funding up-front ([the original proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gj4HMhI4syYFu5tGwR86m_Vqs7HzxneEH4qGETaSaEA/edit?usp=sharing)). These funds have already been **received** by us through [Proposal 145](https://www.dotreasury.com/ksm/proposals/145). After receiving positive feedback on the related [discussion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2091), we are now creating this proposal for the **remaining funding** (9200 Euros).*\n\n*9200 Euros = 9824 USD*\n\n*Using the EMA7: 24.65 USD/KSM*\n\n*9824 / 24.65 = 398.5 KSM*\n\n#### The dashboard is split into 3 parts\n\n**Main dashboard**\n\nPresents the most important statistics to show insightful trends.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/vB1cvPT\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/3s1TYNj/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-22-44.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-22-44\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n**Single referendum view**\n\nDisplays all relevant information for a specific referendum.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/ZgCqT88\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/qgwT1ss/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-51-54.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-51-54\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n**Single account view**\n\nProvides insights into the voting behaviour of a specific wallet.\n<a href=\"https://ibb.co/Wy8Gk1h\"><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VSnJg81/Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-54-36.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-2023-01-01-at-14-54-36\" border=\"0\"></a>\n\n------------------\n<br />\n\nWe initially projected delivery to be in July 2022 and sincerely apologise for the **delay**. While work commenced immediately, we were not fully satisfied with previous iterations. Note that this project was largely executed by data analyst Claudia Yuan as to allow the existing devs for the Proof of Chaos project to keep focused on our other efforts.\n\n### Explanation of the design choices:\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\nFor the dashboard we built a custom [SubSquid indexer](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/indexer) that indexes all relevant governance data in real-time. You can query the data [here](https://squid.subsquid.io/referenda-dashboard/v/0/graphql).\n\n**Drawbacks**:\n\n1. Subsquid indexers are currently still running on **centralized** servers.\n2. The indexer needs to be updated each time there is a **runtime upgrade** with **breaking changes** to the existing logic. \n\n##### *Centralisation*\n\nCurrently all Subsquid indexers are running on the company's servers. While Subquery may have a more decentralized product, we still went with Subsquid due to the ease and speed of development with their solution. The support received from the Subsquid team as well as their commitment to the Polkadot Ecosystem also played a significant role in our decision. Note that Subsquid is working towards decentralisation.\n\n##### *Breaking changes through Runtime upgrades*\n\nThis should be less of an issue as the Kusama network becomes more stable and runtime upgrades become \"less invasive\".\n\n\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\nFor the [frontend](https://github.com/Proof-Of-Chaos/dashboard) we went with a Python Framework called Dash. While this helped us to build quicker, it limited us in flexibility. This route was chosen due to Claudia's familiarity with Python.\n\n--------------\n<br />\n\n### Continuation of the project...\n\nWe are of course interested in extending the dashboard to also include **OpenGov** (Gov2) data. This would be required to measure the effect of our incentivisation efforts going forward. It would involve updating the indexer to incorporate all OpenGov events + extrinsics as well as adapting the front-end to the new type of data (charts/filtering by tracks etc.).\n\nFeel free to also throw any **feature requests** you may have in the comments of the [discussion post](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2091). Thank you very much.",

      "content": "Hello, I'm Claudio and you probably recognise me from the KryptosChain Youtube channel. \nSome of you already know that I've also started a Youtube channel to also help educate the Romanian community on the Polkadot ecosystem.\nThe channel can be found here with the name [Polkadot Romania](https://www.youtube.com/@polkadotromania)\n\nI started this channel at the end of June 2022 and you can find all the details in the proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/121qMKEzJyioIyWvtDw7aYGuZsW9mfNBXc3Crd6Wf2b0)\n\nThe idea is to continue funding it for continuation so that the education can continue for Romanians in their native language.\n\nThe asking amount is **1,359.67 KSM** for **83** educational videos & at least **2 Twitter Spaces** per month to help drive more engagement through from other Romanian Crypto communities, which is worth approximately **$33,380** at the current market rate.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions or doubts, please feel free to ask in the comment section below. \n\nHappy New Year 2023 everyone & let's help the Polkadot ecosystem grow, together !\n\nRegards,\n\nClaudio\n\n********************************\n**Update !**\n\nThis referendum is currently winning and there are 8 days and 13 hours left from the time of writing this before a decision is made. Should this pass, the proposal from this [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2093) will no longer happen until a later time when funding for both channels will be requested and re-calculated based on the KSM price at the time and the dates would be modified. \n\nHowever, that being said, should 46 pass, I will continue to also deliver Polkadot content to my English channel so as to maintain the community up to date, but the quality will not be the same as if funding would be allocated to it due to the inability to pay a video editor and having to do the work myself.\nShould referendum 46 not pass, I will then go ahead and launch the proposal from the [discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2093) as a referendum on chain. I hope this is understandable. Thanks as always for your time !",

      "title": "On-chain Power of Attorney: case study in the Polkadot ecosystem from a legal perspective.",
      "content": "A while back I started preparing a proposal for writing 3 articles within the broader topic of privacy preserving legal transformation in Polkadot. You can find the previous proposal [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1505). I had sought feedback via the Kusama Direction channel back then and the topic of Power of Attorney (PoA) was a clear favorite. Therefore, I have now decided to pursue that topic specifically.\n\nTo reinforce that, I got feedback from the community members that as a first step to win the community's trust and prove added value, it might be better to focus on a smaller funding amount and as such limit the proposal to just one article. That's exactly my plan now.\n\nFinally, I've been told that by limiting the scope of research to the Swiss law only, the impact for the community might be reduced. As such, I've decided to expand the scope and focus on building a general legal framework to regulate on-chain PoA. The authorities (especially in Europe) will face the same types of challenges when dealing with digitising the legal system and I aim to provide a framework and guidelines for addressing these issues from first principles (both legal and technological). In order to ground my research in a practical environment and not just theoretical constructs, I will use the Swiss juridical system to provide examples where appropriate.\n\nYou can find the full proposal on [my GitHub](https://github.com/legal-julia/power-of-attorney-on-polkadot). Below is the summary of the topic and as always, feedback is very welcome:\n\n**On-chain Power of Attorney: challenges and promises for a legal system.**\n- How is PoA currently enforced in EU & Switzerland, who benefits from it and who can abuse it?\n- Private key ?= full access revisited: a need for additional, trusted verification (or else take all my money).\n- A partially government-controlled blockchain - pros and cons. Could a parachain be the solution?\n- Encrypted 'allow-revoke' mechanism, revealable only to selected parties, by the means of substrate chain and a user-friendly app.\n\nThe resulting research article will be submitted to an open-access journal.",

      "content": "## 1kv insights - website and analysis\n\nValidators are the core of NPOS networks like Polkadot and Kusama. In order to avoid concentrated risk with few validators, it is important that the set of validators is sufficiently diverse and decentralized. The Thousands Validators Programme (1kv programme) encourages decentralization of the validators by giving a platform to individuals that want to start running a validator. \n\n- This proposal will **build dashboards with the historical performance and statistics of the 1kv validators**. This unique and detailed insight is important for independent nominators and staking pool operators that are deciding to stake with a 1kv validator.\n\n- With all the data collected, the proposal intends **to answer fundamental questions about the 1kv programme**; for example, is the network more decentralized, does it fulfil its promise for long-term participants to become independent, ... Optimizing the 1kv programme will benefit the whole network.\n\n- Lastly, we intend to **document the inner workings of the 1kv scoring mechanism**. This will allow operators to better align themselves towards the priorities that 1kv wants to incentivize.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MathCryptoDoc/dotsama-snippets/main/1kv-insight-proposal/alpha-site.png)\n\nSince the last month, we have made available an [alpha version of the proposed 1kv insight page](https://insights.math-crypto.com/). It is functional but with only a few metrics. It has 20 to 30 unique visitors *daily*.\n\nFor more details including costs, see our full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mv0GbmkmtOz132C3C1byOK4PVjXxlB4MUak0YYQAaWs).\n\nThe proposal has been up for discussion [here](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1953) since 10 Nov 2022. Community feedback was incorporated.\n\nRequested funding: USD 39'923 or KSM 1'533 based on EMA7 at the time of submission.",

One for selecting the best validators and another for gathering staking income in a spreadsheet. You can try the validator selector [here](https://james-sangalli.github.io/dot-validator-selector/) and the staking income spreadsheet generator [here](https://james-sangalli.github.io/dot-staking-income-web/).\n\nI originally set out to create these tools because I was struggling with staking. Selecting the best validators and tracking your staking income were unsolved issues at the time and they are still causing confusion for many. Therefore, I decided to solve my own problems and the problems of others by creating simple, easy to use tools that would get the job done. \n\nYou can read the full proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YT2qssdH12AtWFRloRnBanK6H1sGuE6EaX782d4qK40/edit?usp=sharing).\n\nThank you for taking the time to consider this proposal!",

In short, we would like to build an open-source Chainlink external adapter for Kusama chaindata and a proof-of-concept dApp. This infrastructure will allow smart contracts on Ethereum to use Kusama chaindata.\n\nPrevious discussion and context [**can be found here**](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/2028).\n\nWe are asking for ~2,811 KSM = ~$83,000 using EMA14 on Kraken. We came to this number by taking the weighted average price of all KSM-USD trades on Kraken from December 1st, 2022 at 18:00 UTC to December 15th, 2022 at 18:00 UTC (13,274 data points).  That came out to a KSM price of ~$29.73 USD. This EMA14 figure can be verified using [**Kraken's API**](https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Trades?pair=KSMUSD&since=1669917600000000000).\n\nWe chose enactment at block #16000000 to put this in the tax year of 2023.\n\nThanks for all the support and feedback!\n\nAdam Steeber\nCTO - Steeber Solutions LLC\n\np.s. though some UIs say that medium spender can only spend up to 500 KSM, this figure was increased to 3,333 KSM in v0934 [**when the `QUID` unit increased by 10x**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/release-v0.9.34/runtime/kusama/constants/src/lib.rs#L29).",
