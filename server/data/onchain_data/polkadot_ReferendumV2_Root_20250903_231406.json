      "title": "Referendum #1729 - OpenGov proposal: Treasury USDT & USDC.",
      "content": "**Track**: Root\n\n**Proposer**: ChaosDAO, JUST Ventures, Jay Chrawnna \n\n**Date**: 26 Aug, 2025\n\n**Requested allocation**:  2,640,000 DOT\n\n**Short description**:  We proposed a structured approach for the Polkadot Treasury to obtain native USDT and USDC, for the purpose of diversification and enabling it to pay out expenses and treasury proposals in stable assets. Through this referendum, we aspire to continue schedules presented in previous proposals and convert 1,320,000 DOT into USDT and 1,320,000 DOT into USDC via the DCA mechanism described in detail below. This proposal presents a long-term solution to acquire different tokens in exchange for treasury DOT by Polkadot governance participants. Total duration with current EMA7 price: 183 days.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL, DIFFERENT TO [REF 1728](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1728)., INCLUDES ALL CALLS TO DCA USDC AND USDT BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE CALL AIMING TO SUPPLY 1M DOT INTO THE HYDRATION'S MONEY MARKET (BORROW FEATURE) TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL YIELD ON IDLE DOT IN TREASURY. A separate proposal will be submitted for this later.**\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**1. Context of the proposal:**\n\nOne of the most requested features for the Polkadot Treasury is the ability to submit proposals in stablecoins such as USDT or USDC. This request arises from a valid concern shared by many community members: reducing volatility in Treasury proposals. Allowing stablecoin-based submissions help preserve the value of Treasury funds, ensuring that sufficient resources remain available to support approved budgets in the future. With the latest upgrades to Substrate and the Polkadot runtime, the Treasury has a lot more tools available to it for its management, including proposals with non-DOT assets like stablecoins.\n\nSimilarly as was done in [referendum 457](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/457), this proposal aims to convert 2,640,000 DOT to USDT and USDC over the course of the next months, with 50% going to each stablecoin. This uses [Hydration's](https://hydration.net/) DCA feature to convert a little bit each day and ensure a steady flow of stablecoins into the Treasury. Like 457, this referendum purchases a fixed amount of stables per trade rather than selling a fixed amount of DOT. For better capital efficiency, the full amount of DOT will be also initially converted into aDOT (yield-bearing collateral token) and supplied into the Hydration Borrow feature. By doing so, the Polkadot Treasury will accumulate yield passively while substantially increasing the DOT supply available for borrowing: thus enabling more DeFi use cases. More details on the functioning mechanism can be found on [this post](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/posts/401).\n\nMoreover, this submission leverages the “Rolling DCA” feature, which allows the schedule to be renewed simply by sending DOT to the proxy account. This also enables the use of governance tracks with lower security assumptions (such as Treasurer) for smaller top-ups when needed.\n\nThis amount accounts for about 22% of the new DOT expected to be minted into the Treasury over the next 6 months (this could vary based on variables like the staking rate).\n\n**2. Proposal objective(s) or solution(s):**\n\nThe creation of a schedule that converts DOT into USDT and USDC via the DCA feature on Hydration, a parachain on Polkadot. The attributes of this proposal are:\n\n- Cost-efficiency (approx. 0.4% of the total amount).\n- No necessity to appoint curators who oversee and manage the process.\n- Conversion is done in small amounts over a longer period which provides a hedge - Against price volatility and manipulation.\n\n**DCA schedule parameters: [USDT]**\n\n- **Total duration with current EMA7 price:** 183 days\n- **Total amount:** 1,320,000 DOT\n- **Trade frequency:** One trade every 40 blocks (approx. 4 minutes)\n- **Per trade:** 80 USDT\n- **Per day:** 28800 USDT\n- **Send to asset hub after accumulating:** 5,000 USDT\n- **Total fee estimation:** 0.4% of total amount acquired\n\n**DCA schedule parameters: [USDC]**\n\n- **Total duration with current EMA7 price:** 183 days\n- **Total amount:** 1,320,000 DOT\n- **Trade frequency:** One trade every 40 blocks (approx. 4 minutes)\n- **Per trade:** 80 USDC\n- **Per day:** 28800 USDC\n- **Send to asset hub after accumulating:** 5,000 USDC\n- **Total fee estimation:** 0.4% of total amount acquired\n\n**Fee estimation breakdown:**\n\n- Trade fee: 0.3% (0.25% to Liquidity Providers, 0.05% to the protocol)\n- Slippage fee: 0.045% (→AMM)\n- Transaction fee on Hydration: 0.035% (→Protocol treasury)\n- Transaction fee on Polkadot Asset Hub: 0.02% (→Asset Hub collators)\n\n_Note: Fees depend heavily on the schedule settings and are estimated based on parameters used. It is worth mentioning that the Hydration protocol also uses dynamic fees based on block space utilization ranging 0.15-5% to protect liquidity providers in times of volatility. All time average trade fees as of proposal submission are around 0.3%._\n\n**Description of steps utilizing XCM to achieve the solution:**\n\na. Send 2,640,000 DOT from the Polkadot treasury to the Pure Proxy account [13JjZiX7QvmHCxwAmT92zugLE4yFNcjFFsbGirTaaYUp5xio] controlled exclusively by the Polkadot chain sovereign account on Hydration [12pPnA1aFic3ibBh9xMwssM1779vfrJBxqD4mDy8d18r4g95]\n\nb. After 1 block to process balance state changes on Hydration, schedule sending an XCM program to Transact on Hydration. This will initiate two DCA schedules, each with a total amount of 1,320,000 DOT, swapping DOT to 80 USDT and 80 USDC every 40 blocks.\n\nc. Once the first USDT chunk is accumulated, initiate a periodic schedule that sends cross-chain chunks of 5,000 USDT and 5,000 USDC from the Pure Proxy on Hydration to the General Treasury account on the Polkadot Asset Hub [14xmwinmCEz6oRrFdczHKqHgWNMiCysE2KrA4jXXAAM1Eogk], totaling to max. 14520 transactions.\n\n**3.

      "title": "Renewal of treasury USDT and USDC Acquisition ",
      "content": "**Track**: Root\n\n**Proposer**: ChaosDAO, JUST Ventures, Hydration\n\n**Date**: March 2025\n\n**Requested allocation**:  5,001,000 DOT\n\n**Short description**:  We proposed a structured approach for the Polkadot Treasury to obtain native USDT and USDC, for the purpose of diversification and enabling it to pay out expenses in a stable asset. Through this referendum, we aspire to renew the schedule presented in proposal #457 and convert 2,500,000 DOT into USDT and 2,500,000 DOT into USDC via the DCA mechanism described in detail below, where an additional 1000 DOT is reserved for transaction fees. This proposal presents a long-term solution to acquire different tokens in exchange for treasury DOT by Polkadot governance participants.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\n**Context of the proposal:**\n\nProbably one of the most-requested features is the ability to make Treasury proposals in stablecoins like USDT and USDC. This is for many reasons, including less volatility around Treasury proposals and preserving the value of the Polkadot Treasury to ensure funds are available to support a given budget in the future.\n\nWith the latest upgrades to Substrate and the Polkadot runtime, the Treasury has a lot more tools available to it for its management, including proposals with non-DOT assets like stablecoins.\n\nAs was done in referendum 457, this proposal is to convert 5,000,000 DOT to USDT and USDC over the course of the next year, with 50% going to each. This uses Hydration's DCA feature to convert a little bit each day and ensure a steady flow of stablecoins into the Treasury.\n\nUnlike 457, this referendum sells a fixed amount of DOT per trade rather than acquiring a fixed amount of USDT/C. For better capital efficiency, the full amount of DOT will be also initially converted into aDOT (yield-bearing collateral token) and supplied into the Hydration Borrow feature. By doing so, the Polkadot Treasury will accumulate yield on the dormant DOT, while substantially increasing the DOT supply available for borrowing, thus enabling more DeFi use cases. More details can be found in [this post](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/posts/401). \n\nMoreover it newly utilizes the “Rolling DCA” feature, which enables renewing the schedule just by sending DOT to the proxy account. This in turn means other governance tracks with lower security assumptions, such as Treasurer, can be used for smaller topups if needed. \n\nThis amount accounts for about 22% of the new DOT expected to be minted into the Treasury over the next year (this could vary based on variables like the staking rate).\n\n**Proposal objective(s) or solution(s):**\n\nThe central proposition entails the creation of a schedule that converts DOT into USDT and USDC via the DCA feature on Hydration, a parachain on Polkadot.\n\nThe attributes of this proposal are:\n- Cost-efficiency (approx. 0.4% of the total amount)\n- No necessity to appoint curators who oversee and manage the process\n- Conversion is done in small amounts over a longer period which provides a hedge for price volatility and manipulation\n\nDCA schedule parameters: [USDT]\n\n- Total duration with current EMA7 price: 365 days\n- Total amount: 2,500,000 DOT\n- Trade frequency: One trade every 20 blocks (approx. 4 minutes)\n- Per trade: 20 DOT\n- Per day: 7200 DOT\n- Send to asset hub after accumulating: 5,000 USDT\n- Total fee estimation: 0.4% of total amount acquired\n\nDCA schedule parameters: [USDC]\n\n- Total duration with current EMA7 price: 365 days\n- Total amount: 2,500,000 DOT\n- Trade frequency: One trade every 20 blocks (approx. 4 minutes)\n- Per trade: 20 DOT\n- Per day: 7200 DOT\n- Send to asset hub after accumulating: 5,000 USDC\n- Total fee estimation: 0.4% of total amount acquired\n\nFee estimation breakdown:\n\n- Trade fee: 0.3% (0.25% to Liquidity Providers, 0.05% to the protocol)\n- Slippage fee: 0.045% (→AMM)\n- Transaction fee on Hydration: 0.035% (→Protocol treasury)\n- Transaction fee on Polkadot Asset Hub: 0.02% (→Asset Hub collators)\n\n**Note**: Fees depend heavily on the schedule settings and are estimated based on parameters used. It is worth mentioning that the Hydration protocol also uses dynamic fees based on block space utilization ranging 0.15-5% to protect liquidity providers in times of volatility. All time average trade fees as of proposal submission are around 0.3%.\n\n**Description of steps utilizing XCM to achieve the solution:**\n\n- Send 5,000,001DOT from the Polkadot treasury to the Pure Proxy account [7N4oFqXKgeTXo6CMSY9BVZdHP5J3RhQXY77Fe7qmQwjcxa1w] controlled exclusively by the relay chain sovereign account on Hydration [7KQx4f7yU3hqZHfvDVnSfe6mpgAT8Pxyr67LXHV6nsbZo3Tm]\n\n- After 1 block to process balance state changes on Hydration, schedule sending an XCM program to Transact on Hydration. This will initiate two DCA schedules, each with a total amount of 2,500,000 DOT, swapping 20 DOT to USDT and USDC every 20 blocks.\n\n- Once the first USDT chunk is accumulated, initiate a periodic schedule that sends cross-chain chunks of 5,000 USDT and 5,000 USDC from the Pure Proxy on Hydration to the General Treasury account on the Polkadot Asset Hub [14xmwinmCEz6oRrFdczHKqHgWNMiCysE2KrA4jXXAAM1Eogk], totaling to max. 27500 transactions.",

      "content": "\n### **Context**\nFollowing the execution of Referenda 1339, the attacker has maliciously added their key as a proxy to the newly established sudo key, effectively freezing all associated PARA funds under the account. As a result, the new sudo key is unable to send transactions, while the attacker retains sudo ownership. Meanwhile, the attacker has initiated unbonding on all six of our accounts, putting 200,000 DOT at risk. We currently have only 16 days left to act, making it crucial to pass this referendum as soon as possible.\n\nThis referendum represents the first step of a two-part rescue plan. The first step is to break the chain and transfer funds to an account that no one controls. The second step will involve submitting another proposal to return the funds to users after securing them. Our team has been collaborating closely with Parity and srlabs, who have provided valuable feedback and a thorough review for this referendum.\n\nThe accounts at risk:\n\n- 14quGMw2tot6JxY2wSyk1Vc1uns3EmMRs2eQS2C66Mdv6uE9 (22.649 DOT)\n- 19cnUyebu52RUt4Rt67brDmmnVdaDD37xdxKbaJ7tuLnLfu (74.614 DOT)\n- 16kTs7tsJ6tYYWAXSWDmm4vYnRTFPWEhXTk4rNCtbw6NRvte (1.566 DOT)\n- 16ZbwPMyrp9yTbPScDqm9btzcNVKKQ5MHcMQp4rA1ztF4sBA (101.322 DOT)\n- 1dMif8G4jrXsdPSkvF87uBfaiahh2EvC9fPnsi91v4i1xKC (3.413 DOT)\n- 16cNboEKEudny4sdpZGNL542Re2sp4FDcTaZFFnYoqRixBwN (250.532 DOT)\n\n### **Objectives**\n1. **Break the Chain**: Disable the attacker's control, effectively neutralizing the parachain and halting any potential malicious activities.\n2. **Remove All Proxies**: Eliminate any proxies associated with the attacker’s key.\n3. **Force Unstake and Transfer**: Unstake the affected accounts and transfer the funds to a Non-Controlled Address.\n4. **Rebond as a Fallback Case**: Prepare for rebonding transactions in case the above strategy fails.\n\n### **Proposed Changes**\nWe have submitted the preimage (0x697eaaab356779518053f23f00eb0c56f53aafc0714556292974dfd7b0155d84), which includes the calldata to secure the funds.

The code demonstrates how to generate a Polkadot-compatible address using a predefined identifier string. The address is derived from a unique input (\"PARALLELFI\\_NEW\\_STAKING\\_ADDRESS\\\\0\\\\0\") and encoded with the Polkadot-specific SS58 format. \n      - The resulting address is safe and non-accessible because: It is generated from a hardcoded, deterministic input string; the input string does not correspond to a private key, meaning it cannot be used for signing transactions or accessing funds. This ensures the address can only be used as a placeholder without security risks. Here’s the code used to generate this special address:\n\n     ```rust\n     use sp_core::crypto::{AccountId32, Ss58AddressFormat, Ss58Codec};\n \n     fn main() {\n         let account = AccountId32::try_from([0x50, 0x41, 0x52, 0x41, 0x4C, 0x4C, 0x45, 0x4C, 0x46, 0x49, 0x5F,\n             0x4E, 0x45, 0x57, 0x5F, 0x53, 0x54, 0x41, 0x4B, 0x49, 0x4E, 0x47,\n             0x5F, 0x41, 0x44, 0x44, 0x52, 0x45, 0x53, 0x53, 0x00, 0x00]).unwrap();\n         let format = Ss58AddressFormat::try_from(\"polkadot\").unwrap();\n         let addr_ss58 = account.to_ss58check_with_version(format);\n         println!(\"Generated address: {addr_ss58}\");\n     }\n     ```\n\n5. **staking.rebond**\n    - This is the final safeguard. If all previous operations fail, the funds must still be successfully rebonded.\n    - This involves setting up a secondary process that can be triggered to re-establish the accounts’ staking status.\n\n### **Testing**\n\nVerification on Chopsticks:  \nWe conducted upgrade tests in the Relaychain fork environment.\nFirstly, we submit the proposal in the relaychain fork environment, then place the decision deposit and vote on the referendum.\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdQ1QXHBHaEMGJvm7MUtQUfMC49pATxKqrUghiz1wz6hJ)\n\n\nThen, we accelerated block production in the relaychain fork environment to ensure the proposal could be quickly approved and enacted. (Image 1 indicates the proposal has been successfully passed, and Image 2 indicates the proposal will be enacted at the target block.)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNwdvsUBqsAuLPDsCYyeZJHLcnoLrfbGxp4LhL4hkuGWR)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/Qme6bdRHaTuLPZbCSyhZXyi2JiU996Twq8FVnjig4vobgh)\n\n\nAfter the proposal is successfully passed, we can observe the following expected results:\n1. The parachain's head and runtime code were successfully reset to null, preventing the hacker from accessing it. The result of setting the runtime code value to 0x does not have a storage key that can be read and displayed. And we can confirm it occurred based on the behavior of the triggered event log.\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmatjYEaQ76jt7b1d6tCWTGMV9ahbJEYkZnd71G59sZxgZ)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmREH93Eb2DZgRGdoe1dNhn5RuTbTqvSqrS6D3sh8xH3Yr)\n\n\n2. The remove_lock operation was successfully executed, which is a critical step allowing us to regain ownership of the parachain in the future.\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXsaKqtFHiS2ypTzmuKPdReDQZuTdTS498iy5F7D6wqNv)\n\n\n3. For the sovereign address and all derivative accounts used for staking, the remove_proxies operation was successfully executed. Additionally, for the funds affected in the accounts used for staking, the force_transfer was successfully completed. Here is the comparison of the proxy and DOT balance states before and after the operation.\n    - Before the referendum executed\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmViDQcsGususedsGqkj4LQLiqc6RVWez8b5eBfuZZNURi)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmP3cmJ1PmcVYKwPqUWffdMeho81hdVYGVXtVc6h15hQbW)\n    - After the referendum executed\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmNbLzb2LJwXXGhKDqrSCzP6fENUBiWgJnNm1cXvqPzSec)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmRaBB5MM42qNFiMD145yRz9ZfVdpAXtk1pV6ij4JxaRUN)\n\n\n4. Our rebond operation, intended as a backup plan, did not come into play as expected in this operation, as all DOT in the derivative accounts had already been successfully transferred prior to the rebond.\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThis proposal represents an urgent step in regaining control over our parachain and securing 200,000 DOT users' funds. By breaking the chain, removing proxies, unstaking and transferring funds, and preparing for a rebonding strategy, we aim to fortify our defenses against this attack. Due to the time-sensitive nature of this situation, we will only execute this first step of the two-step rescue plan. We expect to submit another proposal to return the funds back to users once funds are in a secure place.\n\n\n",

      "title": "Critical Runtime Upgrade to Prevent Further Exploitation",
      "content": "### **Incident Overview**\n- The attacker maliciously upgraded the Parallel runtime, transferring over 312,185 DOT and 126,837 USDT. More than half of the stolen funds have been moved to CEX and sold for XMR. The attacker is still the sudo owner of the parachain and has the minting access, putting additional 125,688 DOT at risk. This proposal aims to prevent further DOT losses and ensure users can safely access their funds through an urgent runtime upgrade. Attacker's address [(Polkadot)](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/16cm11H5g5ZgiaqGL6FYDQVDFGPfujLe8kadQA36BdcTuwRt?tab=transfer) [(Ethereum)](https://etherscan.io/address/0xf6b852758a34c31641994ca6b4357b34ad1c18dc)\n\n### **Timeline of Events [(Please Check Detailed Link)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qxGBsAe99avsuj0ArEaDwCGM5nhT5X5P7b6A83x-KuI/edit?tab=t.0)**\n- **4/14/2024**: The attacker initially deposited DOT and began interacting with the parachain. [Link](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/20339726-2)\n- **10/31/2024**: Proposal of Malicious Runtime Upgrade: The attacker submitted a new runtime upgrade to the democracy pallet containing a malicious code addition. [Link](http://52.15.76.25/parallel/extrinsic/6991170-3/events)\n- **10/31/2024**: Voting on Proposal: The attacker voted to approve their malicious proposal. [Link](http://52.15.76.25/parallel/extrinsic/6991226-2/events)\n- **11/07/2024**: Triggering Malicious Upgrade: The attacker executed the malicious runtime upgrade, introducing a custom \"sudo\" pallet, granting themselves administrative privileges on the parachain. [Link](http://52.15.76.25/parallel/extrinsic/7034406-2/events)\n- **11/07/2024**: Exploitation of Permissions: The attacker leveraged sudo privileges to manipulate proxy permissions on the relay chain. [Link](http://52.15.76.25/parallel/extrinsic/7034718-2/events)\n- **11/22/2024**: Token Minting and Subsystem Control: The attacker minted unauthorized tokens (DOT and USDT) and seized control of parachain features. [Link](http://52.15.76.25/parallel/extrinsic/7112410-2/events) [Link2](http://52.15.76.25/parallel/extrinsic/7112404-2/events)\n- **11/24/2024**: Through the proxy account, the attacker successfully transferred a total of 303,208+ DOT from three of the parachain’s DOT staking ledger accounts to their attack account.  [Link](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/23554590-2) [Link2](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/23554601-3) [Link3](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/23553212-2)\n- **From 11/24/2024 onward**: The attacker unstaked funds on the Polkadot relay chain and sold them on exchanges for XMR (Binance, Huobi, FixedFloat, WhiteBit) (XMR addresses: 133W4GGX3WUEozsvVNMEWeptPfy8Cj8AjqQr6RXTjCT2W1cC, \n14dynDKN3Bcze5R7eYfS485apRCuGrxEBg3HZXvivHv7zNuH, and many more) [Subscan Account Activity](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/16cm11H5g5ZgiaqGL6FYDQVDFGPfujLe8kadQA36BdcTuwRt) \n- **11/30/2024**: All remaining funds were moved to Ethereum, through moonbeam and Axelar bridge. [Link](https://moonscan.io/address/0xf6b852758a34c31641994ca6b4357b34ad1c18dc#tokentxns) [Link2](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3d131a8f255e8a1b7a991f9b3a607ac550c1b5275917d147488c6d3f918da805)\n\n### **Why Is Upgrading the Runtime Necessary?**\n\n- Despite multiple attempts to fix the parachain internally, we discovered that the attacker has disabled critical governance mechanisms, such as the democracy and technical committee modules. This makes it impossible to remove the attacker's sudo access and proxy account without assistance from the relay chain. As a result, we have no option but to request Polkadot Governance's support in restoring our parachain, both for the benefit of our users and the broader Polkadot ecosystem.\n\n### Changes Introduced:\n- **[Github Release Link](https://github.com/parallel-finance/parallel/releases/tag/v3.1.1)** Our proposal is paras -> forceSetCurrentCode(para: 2012, newCode: [our good runtime], leading to the preimage hash of 0x5df19e1463d4bc3e19ad1210e860c4ab305dcf258bffd7ce778ef7bf3c337358 and preimage length of 1525669 as shown in the following screenshot:\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZASLKRh5pjHd4eVZ7VhnSkxi237S8SPgZ3Ar1x9QcJKf)\n- **(1) Addition of the Sudo Pallet**  \n   - This pallet is required to enable the sudo origin; otherwise, the chain state can only be managed through the governance module, which has been disabled by the attacker.\n   - [Code Reference](https://github.com/parallel-finance/parallel/compare/add-sudo#diff-d2685e64237e14800d06d327652f1288d0b39f7eb0e32e1b2424387a2df35863R42)\n\n- **(2) Introduction of a Dummy Pallet**  \n   - A dummy pallet has been implemented to allow our parachain to set a Sudo Key (`5CLbxwBcUf8PG4zzf56w27YwwJzkyGv4ULsBNfkCBGEdRGKv`) under the control of our team. This Sudo Key is guaranteed a minimum balance of 10,000 PARA.  \n   - [Code Reference 1](https://github.com/parallel-finance/parallel/compare/add-sudo#diff-1b6f29a5be0db968850f479f59f7abccaffa98ec1520745ae4bbee429101e2b4R5)  \n   - **Ensuring Sudo Key Integrity:**  \n   - From lines 14 to 27, the code ensures that the `Sudo.key` is always set to the correct value, even if tampered with. During each block initialization (`on_initialize`), it compares the current `Sudo.key` with the expected value. If they differ, the code uses `unhashed::put` to overwrite the incorrect key with the correct one.  \n   - Once updated, an event (`SudoMigrated`) is triggered to log the change, ensuring transparency. This mechanism guarantees the Sudo Key remains properly set, securing administrative control of the chain.  \n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdJYsKqHF6akbay1JYpediTv439AaRi9rxcjCcJZTfuzw)\n   - **Maintaining Sudo Key Balance:**  \n   - From lines 29 to 36, the code ensures the Sudo Key always has sufficient funds for critical actions. It checks the Sudo Key’s balance using `free_balance`. If the balance falls below the predefined minimum (`amount_to_add`), the code uses `deposit_creating` to credit the account with the required amount.  \n   - This operation automatically creates the account if it doesn’t exist. Any system imbalance resulting from this process is safely handled using `drop(imbalance)`. An event (`SudoBalanceDeposited`) is also triggered to log the balance update, ensuring transparency. This ensures the Sudo Key remains functional at all times.\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmZqqB1e7L6XNPfFyCxMZ7jbv4a9bfhw6NheUgu1HJGtqP)\n\n- **(3) Maintaining the Current Spec Version**  \n   - To avoid triggering additional runtime upgrade logic, the current spec version has been maintained.  \n   - [Code Reference](https://github.com/parallel-finance/parallel/compare/add-sudo#diff-4b5d1f2c43c51c8acf794a115560d58f6c7b58e84dbc40af983fb15651b66f88R188)\n\n- **(4) Removal of Migration Scripts and Minor Adjustments**  \n   - Some migration scripts were removed, and minor adjustments were made. These changes are purely for optimization and do not impact runtime logic.  \n   - [Code Reference](https://github.com/parallel-finance/parallel/compare/add-sudo#diff-4b5d1f2c43c51c8acf794a115560d58f6c7b58e84dbc40af983fb15651b66f88L2137)\n\n- **(5) Updating Docker Image Versions and Off-Chain Scripts**  \n   - Docker image versions were updated, and off-chain scripts (including RPC changes) were adjusted. These updates are strictly for optimization purposes.  \n   - [Code Reference](https://github.com/parallel-finance/parallel/compare/add-sudo#diff-af4495a79209e1eae5ace85b8f5dabe2c42ed4e245664a670d4be1b76c2f6878R55)\n\n### Testing:\n- **Upgrade Testing:**  \n  - Upgrade tests were conducted in both a fork of Heiko (Parallel’s testnet on Kusama) and the real Heiko environment. The tests confirmed that the Sudo Key was successfully reset to the specified value.  \n\n- **Verification on Heiko Mainnet:**  \n  - The Sudo Key for Heiko was verified to be `hJFU3r4zioT39AaBiTriJCVvoepeEGViF38DAkKECUjVwsvZK`, corresponding to the universal ss58 address `5CLbxwBcUf8PG4zzf56w27YwwJzkyGv4ULsBNfkCBGEdRGKv`.  \n  - [Heiko Mainnet Link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fheiko-rpc.parallel.fi#/explorer/query/6280198)\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmetUY7yhXCEihquvF3DasZphZymgcEK5wsFV3wU5bLbZe)\n\n- **Verification on Chopsticks:**  \n  - We also conducted upgrade tests in a parallel fork environment. It works as expected: the sudo key was successfully replaced with the desired address. Even when the sudo key’s native balance was emptied, it was still able to mint some gas for the sudo key in the new block. Screenshot here:\n![image.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmexFfMyxqANwbsZAcikURRy87kqGuC427zAshwXeBfWNb)\n\n\n\n### **Action Plan After the Runtime Upgrade**\n\nOnce the proposal is passed and the Sudo pallet is restored, the following actions will be taken:\n\n- **Remove Proxy Accounts**: Eliminate all proxy accounts that the attacker has access to on the relay chain. Detailed steps for this process will be shared next week.  \n- **Revoke Unauthorized Privileges**: If the attacker added additional privileged access (e.g., minting admin) during the voting period, we will revoke these privileges. Similarly, if the attacker unbonded any available DOT during this period, we will rebond them.  \n- **Monitor Suspicious Activity**: Closely monitor transactions from the democracy pallet to prevent similar attacks in the future.  \n- **Remove Asset Mint Admin Access**: As previously promised, we will remove the asset mint admin access to enhance security.\n\n### **How to Recover Stolen Funds?**\n- **Exchange Blocking:** After collaborating with law enforcement and security firm, we successfully engaged over 55 exchanges to actively block and freeze funds from attacker's addresses. For full transparency, we includes an [analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SSfK3pulrfnW_TEd1X1mzSpLPUhb0bKrQXSXziBb9iE/edit?tab=t.0) from SlowMist.\n- **Negotiation:** Despite multiple attempts to communicate with the attacker, we have received no response. \n- **Law Enforcement:**  Every action the attacker takes leaves a trail, and eventually, the net will close. A generous bounty will be offered for information that results in the attacker's capture.\n\n### **What’s Next?**\n- **Regular Communication**: We will keep users, partners, and the community informed about the situation’s progress and any updates to product policies or services.  \n- **Commitment to Users**:  \n   - We are committed to maintaining the codebase and implementing robust security practices to prevent similar issues.  \n   - We will ensure that users’ funds are protected and accessible safely and securely.  \n   - We are dedicated to doing right by our community and users.  \n- **Community Supervision**: We encourage the community to actively supervise and provide feedback to ensure transparency and accountability throughout this process.\n\nWe are pleased to share our [announcement](https://parallelfinance.medium.com/rebuilding-after-the-parachain-attack-a-message-to-our-community-9dccd6c2a080) for addressing some of the existing issues on our platform. Please know that we are fully committed to assisting every user to the best of our abilities. We also welcome your suggestions on how we can improve. Additionally, if you're interested, you can check out this AAG [video](https://x.com/TheKusamarian/status/1867660770017751417) where Yubo explains the proposal and answers some of the community's questions.\n\nThank you for your support!\n",

      "content": "Dear Polkadot Community, As referenced by the account address provided, we are responsible for the whitelist call proposal regarding Parallel Finance goverance taker over,\n\nas noted in Polkadot Referendum #1322.\n\nWe would like to clarify that our action against Parallel Finance given current vote process, we anticipate our failure in that regard. While we are committed to returning the sudo privileges to the proper owners, we must emphasize that **we should not return control to the Parallel Finance team**. This decision is based on evidence of significant fraudulent activities carried out by the team months prior to our actions.\n\nThey are fearful of being discovered and have even decided to remove their Polkadot identity information on Subscan. However, it's not a problem for us, as we have record them.\n\nEvidence suggests that Parallel Finance may have begun executing a rug pull as early as April, though our investigation only covers activities starting from April due to time constraints. **While our attack is only effective begun around Parallel Finance block 6990839-2, on around October 31, 2024.**\n\nWe will list the following addresses at first:\n\nParallel Finance 1 (PF1): The technical and general council account controlled by Yubo p8BDTWhQXouTCuVSSQTSYYDCxAC523iDZXNS9zT8ujgvnbyBh\n\nParallel Finance 2 (PF2): Parallel Finance ancient sudo account, current General Council p8FhJ2kCvAtetismfbfgLBeGwBknFuqT77L9nJXdLTvct35HD, assumed to be controlled by Yubo, , to stay 2/3 control of GC.\n\nCurrent Technical council (TC3): Existing on parallel network only, controlled by Yubo, to stay 2/3 control of TC. p8GZVea2tDJ8s8JY8wWw3heHycetNXmvRnMnncF8VNpfKae77\n\n0xrjman (based on github activity): A key engineer and tech+general council member whose activities appear to be at the heart of many illicit operations p8DShFJGrR5GNZoMvVUMc498Yh1SyuZYntRmnzrwm8t2eTctG\n\n0xrjman is a highly capable individual, and this account serves as an Oracle script account responsible for updating key data, such as the Oracle feedValue extrinsic. The account's activity is designed to enhance privacy by integrating governance and sensitive transactions within a high volume of other transactions, effectively shielding them under a large number of inconspicuous operations.\n\nParallel Finance 3 (PF3) p8ES3KZSGYNLDyRKpGMKZN7iTQzZfNte1g14S4wh562qn6eUv\n\nParachain Finance 4 (PF4), The asset manager for all tokens, endowed with the authority to mint and burn tokens of all types. p8ENzw1bAMXwkUHKySWPhDwD4tN3y4u3DrdAnArS8MBx7MRHP\n\nParachain Finance 5 (PF5), A substantial amount of funds have been transferred from this account to Binance/other exchange. p8F7wLP9JBWrurpuQD6ctb9p7ns2M5YL25DFsyw8cAUQ4v7rn [https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/15BNvxBSi3oZewUURMLHDCzGRbwjhQaf6gRPXSjFA8jRumiK?tab=transfer](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/15BNvxBSi3oZewUURMLHDCzGRbwjhQaf6gRPXSjFA8jRumiK?tab=transfer)\n\nParallel Finance 6 (PF6), A substantial amount of funds have been transferred from this account to Binance/other exchange. p8GLeJ7fK6Vb8mWPofUHNYjLDzD87jw3pGWD4dEfAZjqL5GYd [https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/16Q5tghTd2XnZcxssizmAnWNcx3WMoJTHyNaAkFoZQAh4w3q?tab=transfer](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/16Q5tghTd2XnZcxssizmAnWNcx3WMoJTHyNaAkFoZQAh4w3q?tab=transfer)\n\n\\[The identity of the above account can be verified through multiple methods, even if all identifying information, including the Parallel Finance Project address label on Subscan, is removed.\n\nFor instance, to confirm PF1 [https://polkadot.subscan.io/account\\_list?role=multisigMember&account=152JHcbqqzhWdcz88GLk4n2wYyhfZq6CjxTQa8TbXJxnDZHJ](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account_list?role=multisigMember&account=152JHcbqqzhWdcz88GLk4n2wYyhfZq6CjxTQa8TbXJxnDZHJ)\n\nHowever, this account was previously labeled as the 'Parallel Finance' multisig, which contains several prominent leaders and organizations from the Polkadot ecosystem, unrelated to Parallel Finance.\n\ne.g\n\nOnFinality.io\n\nHanwen, founder of Litentry network\n\nYaoqi, Marketing Director of Parity Asia, Altlayer founder\n\nQinWen, Polkadot web3 Foundation Councilor\n\nSota, founder of Astar network They can provide testimony that the account belongs to Parallel Finance.\n\nPF1’s polkadot format address 1Gu7GSgLSPrhc1Wci9wAGP6nvzQfaUCYqbfXxjYjMG9bob6 Is among multisig.\n\nBased on our knowledge, Parallel Finance is involved in the following activities:\n\n(1) Disable the Statescan/Subscan explorer service support and conduct the XCM token transfer discreetly, as Subscan does not display XCM transfers from parachains to Polkadot when the parachain is unsupported by Subscan.\n\n(2) Secret Minting and Burning of cDOT Tokens: Transactions indicate the minting of cDOT tokens to self-controlled addresses around May. The Parallel Team announced the closure of the crowdloan service for cDOT-6/13, cDOT-7/14, cDOT-8/15, and cDOT-9/16 on July 19. The corresponding function was offline by August 1, followed by a massive burning of users' existing cDOT tokens by GC, which suggests evidence of Parallel Finance burning user positions instead of returning funds.\n\n(3) Using the general council to remove the balance lock on Yubo's account loan position, recreate the borrowing, and transfer the corresponding DOT to Binance. Subsequently, applying the same general council process to reimpose the lock, effectively emptying it.\n\n(4) mint sDOT to self, and do unstaking cheating, mint USDT to self\n\n(5) mint GLMR, ACA and other parachain’s assets, noticed by Moonbeam team.\n\n(6) Covertly modify the market collateral ratio requirements for lending and borrowing multiple times, followed by the mass execution of liquidations on users' positions.\n\nThe evidence provided here is just a small sample of numerous transactions. We have selected only a few due to time constraints, as conducting a thorough analysis from the raw data is not feasible at the moment.\n\nFor (2) Secret minting cDot parallel finance block\n\n5930448-2 2024/05 Asset manager PF5 mint PF6 c8-15\n\n5930457-2 2024/05 PF6 crowdloan redeem 100k DOT\n\n5930462-2 2024/05 PF6 transfer DOT to self on polkadot\n\n5931463-2 2024/05 Asset manager PF5 mint PF6 c8-15\n\n5931484-2 2024/05 PF6 crowdloan redeem 100k DOT\n\n5931495-2 2024/05 PF6 transfer DOT to self on polkadot\n\n5934704-2 2024/05 Asset manager PF5 mint PF6 c8-15\n\n5934989-2 2024/05 Asset manager PF5 mint PF6 c7-14\n\n5934991-2 2024/05 PF6 crowdloan redeem 100k DOT\n\n5934998-2 2024/05 PF6 transfer DOT to self polkadot\n\nBurning user position:\n\n6529428-2 The burn operation, executed by 0xrjman, is a single sample. This extrinsic is combined with oracle feed values.\n\nThere are simply too many mint/burn operations to keep track of. While they may argue, they will return if the user requests it; they’ve just chosen a poor approach. But how can a user track their previous position?\n\nChecking PF5 and PF6 on Polkadot will reveal more insights. The cash flow provides a good summary, though it lacks a detailed breakdown of the affected users.\n\nFor (3) Remove democracy lock of loan position This account is possibly controlled by Yubo. [https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/12VhSPt4Lz6d9DWT1s2kTFkpomir3x5GgZNqUW2MnFf9g8z7?tab=transfer](https://polkadot.subscan.io/account/12VhSPt4Lz6d9DWT1s2kTFkpomir3x5GgZNqUW2MnFf9g8z7?tab=transfer) p8CSFqpqupT9yM6wNocKMqCagB2oTS5pdf6DKvzRinbKngQZB\n\n5740643-2 2024/04 general council proposed by PF1, remove yubo account balance lock\n\n5740650-2 PF1 vote yes,\n\n5740653-2 TC3 vote yes\n\n5740659-2 PF4 close and execute proposal (so here you may say PF4, asset manager is controlled by Yubo)\n\n5740671-3 Lock removed, so yubo account minting loan position\n\n5740681-4 Yubo XCM transfer borrowed DOT to Polkadot and directly to binance\n\n5740684-2 general council proposed by PF1, set lock back\n\nEverything happened within 10 minutes. This is not the only instance of cheating. As far as we can tell, the following account uses the same pattern (removing the lock method) to evade detection: p8B3QXweBQKzu8DhkggwJqFkUVQ53kB1RejtFQ8q3JMSFqqMd\n\nFor (4) mint sDOT cheat\n\n6822134-2 2024/09/29 PF4 asset manager mint 30000 DOT equal sDOT to p8B3CQTp3mAZWQ9ikcDEjmS6ufphivZbpQ9NAx983UVvRqFhK 6822143-2 2024/09/29 unstake\n\n6834989-2 2024/10/2 PF4 asset manager mint 30000 DOT equal sDOT to p8B3QXweBQKzu8DhkggwJqFkUVQ53kB1RejtFQ8q3JMSFqqMd 6834991-2 2024/10/2 unstake\n\nmint USDT cheat\n\n6901070-2 2024/10/14 PF4 asset manager mint p8B3CQTp3mAZWQ9ikcDEjmS6ufphivZbpQ9NAx983UVvRqFhK 30000 DOT equal sDOT and 120000 USDT\n\n6868169-3 2024/10/08 PF4 asset manager minting PF6 the following asset 51391 DOT 31212 USDT 150000 sDOT 10787 ACA 146 GLMR\n\nFor (5) Attacking other parachain token 6900855-2 2024/10/14 PF4 asset manager minting 140K GLMR to 0xrjman.\n\nMoonbeam is so great, response and close XCM channel just in a couple of hours. [https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-74-fast-track-proposal-to-secure-159k-glmr-in-response-to-potential-parallel-finance-chain-exploit/1898](https://forum.moonbeam.network/t/proposal-74-fast-track-proposal-to-secure-159k-glmr-in-response-to-potential-parallel-finance-chain-exploit/1898)\n\nAll of the events mentioned above took place prior to the hacking incident and are completely unrelated to our activities.  \n  \n(6) The tx are too many and each one is huge. We did not sugguest using polkadot.js viewing, since it will block your browser. We should wait until explorer backonline.\n\nBased on PF5, PF6 and other known cheating account, we estimate a sum of 2M+ DOT, and other currency, (should be more than $16M given current market price)\n\nAs highlighted by the Moonbeam team, the current RPC maintained by Parallel Finance is experiencing instability, and it remains unclear whether this is intentional.\n\nIn the event that Parallel Finance shuts down their RPC for verification and investigation, we hope that node providers such as OnFinality and Dwellir, alongside explorers like Statescan and Subscan, will collaborate to restore the explorer and ensure it remains online.\n\nYubo has a prior criminal record related to the failure to return user funds.

We disclose these matters only because doing so does not compromise our interests.\n\nWe will wait for Polkadot Community decision.",

This can be solved by replicating the setup on Asset Hub following the [guidelines](https://blog.kchr.de/guides/force-create-a-pure-proxy-account/) created by Basti, a Polkadot Technical Fellowship Grand Architect.\n\nBelow are the projects that have inaccessible funds on Asset Hub (With Social Media Editorial Board receiving their funds on Nov 20th after [Ref 1306 ](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1306) was submitted.

Similar to [referendum 457](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/457), it uses Hydration's DCA feature to sell a fixed amount of DOT per day. The allotted amount covers one year of conversions.\n\nUnlike 457, rather than acquiring a fixed amount of USDT/C per trade, this sells a fixed amount of DOT per trade.\n\nSee the [proposal doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/113gRdJ-LxqbzhSZZOewL1XPLINjOG0oFtNM9IZVQFX8/edit) for more details, methodology, and calculations.",

      "content": "This is a referendum to follow up on the [discussion](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/post/2324) about funding the Fellowship sub-treasury. It will send 2 million DOT from the \"main\" Treasury into the account controlled by the Core Fellowship sub-treasury. The only feedback was that it should be bigger, so I have increased the proposal from 1 to 2 million.\n\nThis will allow the Fellowship to propose and approve funding proposals directly, allowing teams with more technical proposals to pitch directly to the Fellowship for their work rather than going through the main referendum tracks. Other collectives will have the same ability to grant proposals from their sub-treasuries.\n\nIn the future, with the implementation of [RFC-89](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/89) and related issues, the runtime could automatically configure tranches of inflation to go to specified sub-treasuries.",

      "title": "Proposal for unlocking $PINK from Phala soverign account to sibling account",
      "content": "### TL; DR\n\nThis referendum proposed by Phala Network aim to unlock $PINK from Phala soverign account (on polkadot) to Phala sibling account (on AssetHub) on AssetHub. Thoese $PINK are airdrop we received from PINK team, and is plan to distribute to Phala community.\n\n### Background\n\nRecently, PINK team send the $PINK to all the projects including Phala who join the their lunch game earlier. Within this [extrinsic](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/0xca5c3d7937402d9e737e5c845ef8b88b6ef5167c3c84051ff7cdc4171ff120b0), Phala's soverign account [13YMK2efovqo4yTgPvgeUnDeKWiLpGXkspJfhJo4YuiehJwG](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/13YMK2efovqo4yTgPvgeUnDeKWiLpGXkspJfhJo4YuiehJwG) has received 18,862,885 $PINK in total.\nHowever, due to our mistake (there is nothing regarding to PINK team), we provide the soverign account to PINK team, whereas we should provide the sibling account **[13cKp89Utf2hCaBpwvdjbRZTZzPeXgarwTx6xGKZRdkDZ2Z8](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/account/13cKp89Utf2hCaBpwvdjbRZTZzPeXgarwTx6xGKZRdkDZ2Z8)** instead. By the design of XCM protocol, we have no control of the sovereign account on AssetHub, thus we don't have the ability to move asset through XCM.\nFor now, the $PINK was unlocked on sovereign account, it is safe because no one else has the ability to move it.\n\n### Why we need this referendum\n\nGenerally, the admin of an asset (based on pallet-asset) have the ability to move assets between any account, but to make the community truly decentralized, PINK team has already renounced the admin role. So the only way to move $PINK out is to send XCM message from Polkadot (the relay chain), this operation need to have a referendum to do so.\n\n### What we will  do if the proposal passed\n\nAfter $PINK being move to our sibling account 13cKp89Utf2hCaBpwvdjbRZTZzPeXgarwTx6xGKZRdkDZ2Z8, we will follow the google sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14E-IvAwnottmkGN8-E3TxVBPElyeJJYVkb7Msa4TKuA/edit?usp=sharing) to distribute $PINK to the luck users.  The distribution strategy was entirely discussed and proposed by Phala community, check [here](https://phala.subsquare.io/posts/16).\n\nMuch appreciated for your voting.",

      "title": "Proposal for JAM Ratification, Conformance, Performance by Polkadot Fellows",
      "content": "The scope and direction of JAM as specified in the [Gray Paper](https://graypaper.com/) describes a protocol which could replace the Polkadot Relay-chain. Although this is not yet decided, the paper reads: \n\n“In this paper, we introduce a decentralized, cryptoeconomic protocol to which the Polkadot Network could conceivably transition itself in a major revision. Following this eventuality (which must not be taken for granted since Polkadot is a decentralized network) this protocol might also become known as Polkadot or some derivation thereof. However, at this stage this is not the case, therefore our proposed protocol will for the present be known as Jam”\n\nAn early, unrefined, version of this protocol was first proposed in [Polkadot Fellowship RFC-31](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/31), known as “CoreJam”. CoreJam takes its name after the collect/refine/join/accumulate model of computation at the heart of its service proposition.\n\nFor all of the reasons above, this proposal aims to make a decision on the responsibility regarding ratification, conformance and performance of JAM. Those voting Aye will vote for Polkadot Fellows to be responsible for:\n \n- Ratifying the final JAM protocol and defining conformance and performance tests for the Polkadot JAM Protocol. \n- The development and deployment of a Polkadot-Relay-chain compatibility service on the JAM protocol. \n\nIf JAM is to replace Polkadot Relay-chain, the Polkadot Relay-chain should halt on signal from the Polkadot Fellows when it is determined that the Polkadot JAM chain, the Polkadot Relay-chain compatibility service and all required system parachains are ready for launch. Readiness shall include a minimum of independent professional audit of the protocol specification and of three independent and viable block producing implementations which pass the published conformance and performance tests.\n\nThis proposal is submitted as a remark call: this means that the approval of this proposal aims to signal the willingness of the community to accept the ratification and supervision of JAM by the Technical Fellowship - but no changes onchain will be executed if the proposal is approved.",

      "content": "This is a referendumV2 whose proposer address (14jLVudzMk7udKvBUdFwPpgQnFKPpE4GxAYRJpEpokBgdmKq) is shown in on-chain info below. Only this user can edit this description and the title. If you own this account, login and tell us more about your proposal.\n\n# **Abstract/TLDR**\n\nFollowing a significant hacking incident compromising Starlay Finance [https://twitter.com/starlay\\_fi/status/1755605617421795560](https://twitter.com/starlay_fi/status/1755605617421795560 \"Starlay hacking incident\"), we are urgently seeking support from the Polkadot community. \n\n# **Details of the Request**\n\nThe gravity of this situation and its potential repercussions on our users and the broader ecosystem necessitate your immediate support. We aim to explore viable measures to transfer all the DOT from the hacker's account to Starlay's account.\n\n-   **Amount at Risk:** Approximately 200k DOT\n-   **Concerned Hacker’s Addresses on the Relay Chain:**\n\n-   The hacker’s addresses are colored in red in the account  tab\n    -   [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Xko-3xY40qhF9rkPMYgrl35QAoT2aVkjsNsKYp15ns/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11Xko-3xY40qhF9rkPMYgrl35QAoT2aVkjsNsKYp15ns/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n# **Situation: Hacking Details**\n\nThe hack compromised all DOT and LDOT deposits within the Starlay protocol, with significant activities traced to the account **`0xe6F6D3cd38e9BF1e118C8Fd1528D303d261BA4F7`**. The exploitation centered around the Starlay interest-bearing USDC (lUSDC) address, which can be reviewed [here](https://blockscout.acala.network/address/0x28A5AFACF605955e4c3aaF23b704C42Acd44EBb4/token-transfers#address-tabs).\n\n## **Incident Summary**\n\nThe exploit was a result of anomalies within the USDC pool's liquidity index calculation, enabling the attacker to withdraw significantly more than their initial deposit after borrowing LDOT. This incident underscores a critical oversight in the pool's maintenance, particularly the failure to update the liquidity index due to prolonged inactivity.\n\n## **Incident Description**\n\nThe USDC pool remained devoid of funds for an extended period, approximately 20 to 25 days. This inactivity led to significant timestamp changes, resulting in an abnormally large newLiquidityIndex. The lToken (representative of a user’s share in the pool) balance calculation, which relies on the normalizedIncome derived from the liquidityIndex, became distorted. Consequently, an attacker capitalized on this miscalculation by depositing into the pool, which triggered an unexpected increase in the liquidityIndex to 1,350,009,778 \\* 10^27. This inflated the attacker’s lToken balance well beyond their actual deposit. The formula used was: balanceOfLToken = rayMul(realDeposit, liquidityIndex) = (realDeposit \\* liquidityIndex + 0.5 \\* 10^27) / 10^27. With a real deposit of 20,000,000 (with 6 decimals), the balanceOfLToken escalated to 27,000,195,560,000,000,000. This discrepancy allowed the attacker to withdraw USDC funds after borrowing LDOT (or DOT), despite the initial deposit being significantly lower.\n\n## **Initial Setup and oversight:**\n\nAt the launch of the Starlay protocol, three tokens were slated for listing: DOT, LDOT, and USDC. While DOT and LDOT were integrated through the Euphrates initiative, the USDC pool did not receive the necessary attention and remained unfunded. This neglect resulted in the liquidityIndex not being updated for an extended duration, setting the stage for the exploit.\n\nWe welcome any assistance, advice, or support you can offer. Together, we can overcome this adversity and strengthen our ecosystem against future threats.Thank you for your attention and solidarity.",

      "content": "# Polkadot Ambassador Program\n\nThis document describes the mandate for a proposed Polkadot Ambassador Program, to be realized as an on-chain, rank-based, system collective.\n\nMembers of the program, Ambassadors, should represent Polkadot outside of its existing sphere and help bring new entrants into the Polkadot ecosystem. In this capacity, ambassadors have a lot of similarity to what might normally be considered business development, outreach, and relationship management. They should introduce new people and organizations to Polkadot, speak at and host events, and facilitate partnership creation.\n\nAlthough anyone can perform these services in their own capacity, having a program that formally recognizes members makes the work more effective. The recognition that comes with a title like Ambassador helps in building important relationships.\n\nA rank-based, on-chain collective will allow the network to manage membership in a decentralized way, and also allow the organization to manage a treasury for salaries, events, and other expenses incurred in fulfilling its objectives.\n\n## Membership\n\nThe program will have four ranks, from highest to lowest: Head Ambassador (HA), Senior Ambassador (SA), Ambassador, and Candidate Ambassador (CA).\n\n### Head Ambassadors\n\nHead Ambassadors are the highest ranking group of ambassadors and correspondingly hold the most power within the group. Head Ambassadors can only be appointed (or removed) via general token-holder referendum on a new, Ambassador Admin track. This track should be configured in a similar fashion to the existing Fellowship Admin track.\n\nThe role of Head Ambassador should necessitate activity on par with a full time job. Besides their capacity of leading the program, HAs should be able to represent Polkadot effectively to new people and businesses and be able to speak fluently on the philosophy underpinning Web3 technologies, on Polkadot and its high-level design decisions, how Polkadot compares to other blockchain tech stacks, and typical user stories like staking, participating in governance, or building parachains. They may not be (and probably are not) developers, but they should demonstrate sufficient skill, understanding, and communication ability to be trusted to work autonomously in the best interest of Polkadot.\n\nThe program should only allow up to 21 Head Ambassadors. Once the number is reached, adding a new HA shall require replacing an existing HA or making a proposal to all token holders on the Ambassador Admin track to alter the program.\n\n### Senior Ambassadors\n\nSenior Ambassadors are promoted from Ambassador on the Head Ambassador track. The SAs should be experienced Polkadot Ambassadors who have already made substantial contributions to the success of Polkadot. One would expect that SAs have been using Polkadot and are engaged in the ecosystem by for example hosting or speaking at events or participating in a non-trivial way in governance discussions.\n\n### Ambassadors\n\nThe Ambassador tier is the main level of the program where the majority of people will stand. Ambassadors should be fluent in most end-user applications of Polkadot. They should, for example, be able to show a new person how to stake via a nomination pool or how to set an identity on-chain. Ambassadors may do any number of things, like translate documentation, make tutorials in written or video form, host/attend events, etc. It is up to the judgement of the HAs and SAs to set objectives for the program and decide what is most effective and what should be recognized.\n\n### Candidates\n\nAll new joiners to the program enter as a Candidate. Ambassadors can induct Candidates, but they will need approval from the Senior Ambassador track to get promoted to Ambassador. Members should generally not stay Candidates for long (as a guideline, no more than six months); it ensures a fast onboarding to the program, but those who are inactive should be removed and those who are active and competent should be promoted to Ambassador.\n\n## Treasury and Salaries\n\nThe Ambassador Program should have an on-chain Treasury. It is envisioned that this Treasury is used in the following ways.\n\n### Salaries\n\nHead Ambassadors shall receive a salary of 10,000 USDT (or equivalent stablecoin) per month. This represents their commitment to representing Polkadot in the equivalent of full-time capacity and their ability to bring high-value entrants into Polkadot. Given that personal circumstances can necessitate periods of lower activity (e.g. vacation, family, illness), HAs can place themselves on a passive 2,000 USDT per month allowance until they are back full-time.\n\nOther members of the program do not receive a regular salary, although they may make proposals to the Treasury to cover expenses or recognize exceptional work.\n\n### Proposals\n\nMembers of the program at any rank can make funding proposals to the Treasury. These proposals could be to cover expenses related to hosting an event, for rewarding exceptional contributions by members, putting funds into the salary account, or for general Treasury management (for example converting some DOT to a stablecoin or other asset).\n\nThe Treasury shall have two main tracks:\n\n1. Spends of less than 1,000 USDT can be approved by the Senior Ambassador track.\n2. Spends of 1,000 USDT or greater must be approved by the Head Ambassador track.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<!-- -->\n\n## Seeding\n\nThe introduction of the program to the Polkadot runtime should not include any initial members. Only after the program is included in the Polkadot runtime should referenda be held to appoint Head Ambassadors.\n\nBecause the Head Ambassador track is powerful within the group and there will be a seeding phase where there is a small number of HAs, the HAs shall not take any action until there are at least ten HAs appointed. That is, until such point, the program should not be allocated Treasury funds, all remarks from HAs shall be ignored, and HAs who use the track to induct Ambassadors or Senior Ambassadors should have a referendum to be removed as Head Ambassador.\n\n## Modifications and Evolution\n\nMuch like the Technical Fellowship, the Ambassador Program may want to implement changes to how the group operates. It should do this by passing a remark on its Head Ambassador voting track that states the change. This is similar to the Fellowship’s RFC process.\n\nChanges that significantly affect token holders or Head Ambassadors, like program salaries or how many HAs should exist in the program, should pass referendum on the public Ambassador Admin track.\n\n## Tracks\n\nThe Ambassador Program should have the following internal tracks:\n\n- Head Ambassadors: A track expressing the voice of Head Ambassadors. As only HAs can vote, each vote is weighted equally.\n- Senior Ambassadors: A track expressing the rank-weighted voice of Senior and Head Ambassadors. Each HA shall have five votes and each SA shall have one vote.\n- Ambassadors: A track expressing the rank-weighted voice of Ambassadors, Senior Ambassadors, and Head Ambassadors. Each HA shall have ten votes, each SA shall have two votes, and each Ambassador shall have one vote.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n<!-- -->\n\nAll tracks should have a voting period of seven days, with a linear curve such that greater than 50% turnout unanimously in favor can pass a motion at its start and a simple majority of voters at the end (as in, no turnout requirement).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAn on-chain group of ambassadors, dedicated to furthering the awareness, adoption, and ultimate success of Polkadot will be a powerful organization. It should have resources and recognition from the network itself that will attract skilled and effective representatives of Polkadot.\n\n\\============\n\nThe format of the remark is taken from [RFC-12](<https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/eb7679a/text/0012-process-for-adding-new-collectives.md>) in the form `APPROVE_COLLECTIVE(\"{collective name}, {commitment}\")`, where the collective name is \"Polkadot Ambassador Program\" and the commitment is the Blake2 hash of the program description, `98dfd4f93660b5858d21d4522f4266484b9bc8303c9db7190200f15086dcf6b7`.\n\nTo regenerate the commitment and the on-chain call, you can download the attached `ambassador-program.md` file and run the following python script:\n\n```python\nfrom hashlib import blake2b\n\nfname = './ambassador-program.md'\nh = blake2b(digest_size=32)\n\nwith open(fname, 'rb') as f:\n    h.update(f.read())\n\nprint('{}'.format(h.hexdigest()))\n\n# Output: 98dfd4f93660b5858d21d4522f4266484b9bc8303c9db7190200f15086dcf6b7\n```\n\n[https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kBUg8Ahrm5UQJf-zBxvFKmqlVAjDeEz/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17kBUg8Ahrm5UQJf-zBxvFKmqlVAjDeEz/view?usp=sharing)",

In this capacity, ambassadors have a lot of similarity to what might normally be considered business development, outreach, and relationship management. They should introduce new people and organizations to Polkadot, speak at and host events, and facilitate partnership creation.\n\nAlthough anyone can perform these services in their own capacity, having a program that formally recognizes members makes the work more effective. The recognition that comes with a title like Ambassador helps in building important relationships.\n\nA rank-based, on-chain collective will allow the network to manage membership in a decentralized way, and also allow the organization to manage a treasury for salaries, events, and other expenses incurred in fulfilling its objectives.\n\n## Membership\n\nThe program will have four ranks, from highest to lowest: Head Ambassador (HA), Senior Ambassador (SA), Ambassador, and Candidate Ambassador (CA).\n\n### Head Ambassadors\n\nHead Ambassadors are the highest ranking group of ambassadors and correspondingly hold the most power within the group. Head Ambassadors can only be appointed (or removed) via general token-holder referendum on a new, Ambassador Admin track. This track should be configured in a similar fashion to the existing Fellowship Admin track.\n\nThe role of Head Ambassador should necessitate activity on par with a full time job. Besides their capacity of leading the program, HAs should be able to represent Polkadot effectively to new people and businesses and be able to speak fluently on the philosophy underpinning Web3 technologies, on Polkadot and its high-level design decisions, how Polkadot compares to other blockchain tech stacks, and typical user stories like staking, participating in governance, or building parachains. They may not be (and probably are not) developers, but they should demonstrate sufficient skill, understanding, and communication ability to be trusted to work autonomously in the best interest of Polkadot.\n\nThe program should only allow up to 21 Head Ambassadors. Once the number is reached, adding a new HA shall require replacing an existing HA or making a proposal to all token holders on the Ambassador Admin track to alter the program.\n\n### Senior Ambassadors\n\nSenior Ambassadors are promoted from Ambassador on the Head Ambassador track. The SAs should be experienced Polkadot Ambassadors who have already made substantial contributions to the success of Polkadot. One would expect that SAs have been using Polkadot and are engaged in the ecosystem by for example hosting or speaking at events or participating in a non-trivial way in governance discussions.\n\n### Ambassadors\n\nThe Ambassador tier is the main level of the program where the majority of people will stand. Ambassadors should be fluent in most end-user applications of Polkadot. They should, for example, be able to show a new person how to stake via a nomination pool or how to set an identity on-chain. Ambassadors may do any number of things, like translate documentation, make tutorials in written or video form, host/attend events, etc. It is up to the judgement of the HAs and SAs to set objectives for the program and decide what is most effective and what should be recognized.\n\n### Candidates\n\nAll new joiners to the program enter as a Candidate. Ambassadors can induct Candidates, but they will need approval from the Senior Ambassador track to get promoted to Ambassador. Members should generally not stay Candidates for long (as a guideline, no more than six months); it ensures a fast onboarding to the program, but those who are inactive should be removed and those who are active and competent should be promoted to Ambassador.\n\n## Treasury and Salaries\n\nThe Ambassador Program should have an on-chain Treasury. It is envisioned that this Treasury is used in the following ways.\n\n### Salaries\n\nHead Ambassadors shall receive a salary of 10,000 USDT (or equivalent stablecoin) per month. This represents their commitment to representing Polkadot in the equivalent of full-time capacity and their ability to bring high-value entrants into Polkadot. Given that personal circumstances can necessitate periods of lower activity (e.g. vacation, family, illness), HAs can place themselves on a passive 2,000 USDT per month allowance until they are back full-time.\n\nOther members of the program do not receive a regular salary, although they may make proposals to the Treasury to cover expenses or recognize exceptional work.\n\n### Proposals\n\nMembers of the program at any rank can make funding proposals to the Treasury. These proposals could be to cover expenses related to hosting an event, for rewarding exceptional contributions by members, putting funds into the salary account, or for general Treasury management (for example converting some DOT to a stablecoin or other asset).\n\nThe Treasury shall have two main tracks:\n\n1. Spends of less than 1,000 USDT can be approved by the Senior Ambassador track.\n2. Spends of 1,000 USDT or greater must be approved by the Head Ambassador track.\n\n## Seeding\n\nThe introduction of the program to the Polkadot runtime should not include any initial members. Only after the program is included in the Polkadot runtime should referenda be held to appoint Head Ambassadors.\n\nBecause the Head Ambassador track is powerful within the group and there will be a seeding phase where there is a small number of HAs, the HAs shall not take any action until there are at least ten HAs appointed. That is, until such point, the program should not be allocated Treasury funds, all remarks from HAs shall be ignored, and HAs who use the track to induct Ambassadors or Senior Ambassadors should have a referendum to be removed as Head Ambassador.\n\n## Modifications and Evolution\n\nMuch like the Technical Fellowship, the Ambassador Program may want to implement changes to how the group operates. It should do this by passing a remark on its Head Ambassador voting track that states the change. This is similar to the Fellowship’s RFC process.\n\nChanges that significantly affect token holders or Head Ambassadors, like program salaries or how many HAs should exist in the program, should pass referendum on the public Ambassador Admin track.\n\n## Tracks\n\nThe Ambassador Program should have the following internal tracks:\n\n- Head Ambassadors: A track expressing the voice of Head Ambassadors. As only HAs can vote, each vote is weighted equally.\n- Senior Ambassadors: A track expressing the rank-weighted voice of Senior and Head Ambassadors. Each HA shall have five votes and each SA shall have one vote.\n- Ambassadors: A track expressing the rank-weighted voice of Ambassadors, Senior Ambassadors, and Head Ambassadors. Each HA shall have ten votes, each SA shall have two votes, and each Ambassador shall have one vote.\n\nAll tracks should have a voting period of seven days, with a linear curve such that greater than 50% turnout unanimously in favor can pass a motion at its start and a simple majority of voters at the end (as in, no turnout requirement).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAn on-chain group of ambassadors, dedicated to furthering the awareness, adoption, and ultimate success of Polkadot will be a powerful organization. It should have resources and recognition from the network itself that will attract skilled and effective representatives of Polkadot.\n",

Additional details about this proposal were made available in a Medium article titled \"[Introducing Q Token and Enhancing Equilibrium’s Ecosystem](https://medium.com/equilibrium-eosdt/introducing-q-token-and-enhancing-equilibriums-ecosystem-52dbcb7c99f8)\"\n\nThis proposal introduces Q as a new token and proposes a conversion rate of 502.96 EQ for each new Q token, effectively diluting existing investors by 100. The disconcerting aspect is that only 5.915% of the original tokens are allocated for swapping, suggesting a dubious attempt to print new tokens at the expense of the original investors. It's important to note that Equilibrium (EQ) tokens are actively traded on platforms such as Gate.io, exposing original investors to potential harm.\n\n**Concerns**:\n\nThe unsettling elements of Equilibrium's proposal include:\n\n- **Deceptive Tokenomics Adjustment**: The proposed tokenomics adjustment is perceived as deceptive, potentially constituting a scam that undermines the trust and confidence of loyal investors.\n\n- **Opaque Decision-Making**: The referendum reveals a lack of transparency in the decision-making process, raising concerns about the project's commitment to community engagement and open communication.\n\n- **Detrimental Impact on Original Investors**: The proposed changes, especially the substantial reduction in token value, disproportionately affect original investors who have been integral to Equilibrium's growth.\n\n\n**Proposed Action**:\n\nTo address these concerns, we propose the following actions if the Equilibrium referendum moves forward:\nDeregistration of Equilibrium Parachain: \n\n- Initiate the process to deregister Equilibrium as a Polkadot parachain.\n\n- Early Refund of Crowdloaned Funds: Refund the crowdloaned funds to contributors given the change in project direction and potential harm to investors.\n\n**Governance Mechanism**:\n\nThe OpenGov system will facilitate the governance process for this proposal. Polkadot token holders will have the opportunity to review and vote on the proposal through the Polkadot governance platform.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nThis proposal aims to protect the interests of Polkadot token holders and maintain the integrity of the Polkadot ecosystem. The community is encouraged to review and participate in the governance process to ensure a fair and transparent resolution to the concerns raised by the Equilibrium referendum.",

      "title": "Proposal for USDC Sufficiency on Polkadot Asset Hub",
      "content": "Circle is a global financial technology firm and the issuer of USDC. USDC is a fully reserved digital dollar, also known as a stablecoin that’s 100% backed by highly liquid cash and cash-equivalent assets, and is always redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. USDC is one of the largest and most widely used stablecoins in Web3 with over $25B in circulation as of October 2nd, 2023.\n\nCircle publishes weekly breakdowns and monthly attestations of the USDC reserve (see [here](https://www.circle.com/en/transparency)), and its financial statements undergo annual audits. Circle has registered USDC on Polkadot Asset Hub (Asset ID 1337), which can be verified [here](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/assets/1337?tab=activity).\n\nCircle is requesting Polkadot Relay Chain governance to make USDC sufficient on Polkadot, so that USDC can be used to pay transaction fees and exist on accounts without DOT. Circle is excited to be working with the Polkadot ecosystem because of the broad reach and growth potential of XCM, the security assurances from Polkadot validators, and the increasing developer traction within the Polkadot community.\n\nAssets on Polkadot can be Sufficient or Non-Sufficient. To hold a Non-Sufficient asset in a Polkadot Asset Hub wallet address, a corresponding Polkadot Asset Hub account needs to exist on-chain. This is different from other chains, where a wallet address can hold other tokens by default. On Polkadot Asset Hub, users need to ensure that the receiving wallet address holds at least 0.1 DOT, which is the Existential Deposit for establishing a Polkadot Asset Hub account, prior to sending additional assets to the address. However, Sufficient assets can also establish a Polkadot Asset Hub account, such that the Existential Deposit in DOT is not necessary. Circle is requesting this property of sufficiency for USDC to be voted on by Polkadot Relay Chain governance.\n\nThis sufficiency proposal can make it easier for Polkadot to attract mainstream users, who would be able to use USDC to directly pay gas and execute transactions on Polkadot. Simplifying user experience and expanding access to USDC liquidity can help developers onboard more users and bring new use cases to the Polkadot ecosystem. Ultimately, sufficiency for USDC can improve accessibility and help the ecosystem grow and attract future projects.",

      "title": "Unbrick Nodle",
      "content": "Please check our post [here](https://medium.com/nodle-io/latest-parachain-upgrade-what-everyone-should-know-9d5563e97a70) describing the incident and its reasons. In this document we will be focused on a detailed description of the steps taken to resolve the issue.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nThe Nodle Parachain is bricked after its last upgrade failed. This proposal proposes to use the _forceSetCode_ functionality on Polkadot to ensure the prompt restart of the parachain.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe solution presented below intends to maintain the existing Parachain state, and not require to revert previously approved transactions which would break finality guarantees.\n\nIt appears everything in the recent upgrade was sound with all state transitions being correct and intended. However, _the migration code associated with the upgrade is taking too long and caused the proof of verification to grow beyond what the relay chain validators tolerates_. Because the migration happens right when the runtime is upgraded, this causes the parachain to halt block production as the next block would always be rejected by the Polkadot validators. _As such, the head of the parachain did not progress to any undesired state, and thus can be reused_.\n\nThis means that it should be possible to unbrick the parachain by force setting the current code to a new runtime that is very similar to the stored runtime. As such, [a new runtime has been prepared](https://github.com/NodleCode/chain/releases/tag/2.2.2-hotfix) with the changes below:\n\n-   Identical spec version than initially deployed\n-   Keeps the uniques pallet at the same storage prefix\n-   Remove the migration\n-   Remove the new pallet associated to the migration\n\nWhen this code is forced on the relay chain then collators can use the _\\--wasm-runtime-overrides_ flag to force their nodes to use the appropriate wasm code that is recognized by the relay chain.\n\n**Testing and verification**\n\nHere are the steps we took to test this proposal:\n\n1.  We used _polkadot-launch_ and ran a local rococo relay chain with a few validators and a collator of our _eden-dev_ parachain. All with fresh states starting from scratch. For the relay chain binary we used _Polkadot-0.9.42_ and for our parachain we used _nodle-2.0.30_ which is the previously published image for our nodes and contains the exact same runtime as it was on our chain right before the problematic upgrade.\n2.  We made runtime wasm out of [code](https://github.com/NodleCode/chain/blob/sample-failure/runtimes/eden/src/migrations.rs#L25-L26) that could easily induce the heavy migration step for a local test. We selected the integration of an infinite loop as the fastest way to reproduce the conditions of the issue.\n3.  We upgraded the local collators runtime with the runtime wasm which had the intentional failure in its migration. We noticed the node indeed stopped producing blocks with the exact same message as we had seen on our collator “Discarding proposal …took too long“. _This confirms correct reproduction of the current issue_.\n4.  We then used Sudo on the local rococo relay chain and called _forceSetCurrentCode_ with the [runtime wasm](https://github.com/NodleCode/chain/releases/tag/2.2.2-hotfix) that we are going to use in our proposal. Let’s refer to that as the good runtime. We already have discussed the idea behind this code change in the Solution section above.\n5.  We then stopped the collator and re-ran it using _\\--wasm-runtime-overrides_ and setting it to the folder that contained the good runtime. The storage of the collator was maintained and no modification was made there. After the restart the collator started producing blocks and the relay chain backed and included them.\n\n**Proposal Preimage**\n\nOur proposal is _paras -> forceSetCurrentCode(para: 2026, newCode: \\[our good runtime\\]_, leading to the preimage hash of “_0xbdeb173184c3a932473b7921c0feb233900bbe9228c54dc346239a93b186e9cc_” and preimage length of _1216833_ as shown in the following screenshot:\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/p4jJth8/Screenshot-2023-08-24-at-2-05-52-PM.png)\n\n**Prevention Strategy**\n\nWe intend to work with the Polkadot community to improve existing testing tools to detect similar issues to the one being fixed today. Namely, we would like to extend _try-runtime_ to at least show if the PoV for a runtime upgrade is growing beyond the 5MB limit that is set for validators. Alternatively, this could also take the form of an independent test tool as well.\n\nRegardless of what tool is developed, we will enforce the benchmarking of any migration code in our upgrade process.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to investigate whether some patches could be contributed to the Polkadot codebase to optimize for the liveness of parachains by falling back to the last known good runtime in case of upgrade or migration failures. Because this sounds like a much bigger effort given our team expertise, we will need further discussions on this topic.",

This proposal aims at correcting that by modifying the on-chain config.\n\n## Problem\n\n The `HostConfiguration::consistency_check` function asserts that the on-chain [`max_code_size`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.41/runtime/parachains/src/configuration.rs#L376) is never larger than `MAX_CODE_SIZE`. This is violated on Polkadot since the concrete `max_code_size` on-chain is 10 MiB and `MAX_CODE_SIZE` is only [3 MiB](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.41/primitives/src/v2/mod.rs#L331).  \n You can verify this by querying [PolkadotJS](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/js):\n \n```js\nlet config = await api.query.configuration.activeConfig();\nconsole.log(config.maxCodeSize / (1024*1024), \"MiB\");\n// Prints 10 MiB\n```\n\nIt is neccecary to correct this since otherwise the `consistency_check` will stay a No-OP with the [assumption](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/v0.9.41/runtime/parachains/src/configuration.rs#L1324): \"You cannot break something that is already broken\".\n\n\n## Proposal\n\nSet the on-chain `max_code_size` back to a sane value of 3 MiB. A larger value is not expected to work due to networking restrictions. Related discussions about this are in [polkadot/#7108](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7108) and [polkadot/#7105](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7105).\n\n## Impact on Para*s\n\nParachain/Parathread teams should check that all queued runtime upgrade have a size of at most 3 MiB (the `Runtime Size` as reported by `srtool`). A sweep across [all parachains](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/7108#issuecomment-1516220831) showed that the largest is currently 1.7 MiB, that is about 57% of the new limit.
