      "title": "[Whitelisted Caller] Reduce the number of pending messages allowed in an HRMP channel",
      "content": "\nBy default, when opening an HRMP channel, the number of pending messages that can be queued on the relay chain for the channel is the one defined in the active host configuration (`HostConfiguration::hrmp_channel_max_capacity`).\n\nThe current value is 1000 and this referenda proposes to reduce it to 25.\n\nA sending parachain can push at most 1 HRMP message to the relay chain per block while the receiving parachain processes all the pending messages at once. When the limit of pending messages is reached, the sending parachain can't forward any more HRMP message to the relay chain, having to queue them locally. The local queue also has a backpressure mechanism. Even if the receiving parachain has a delay of a couple of blocks in processing the pending messages, 25 pending messages should be enough for everything to work smoothly. \n\nAnd if we're in a corner case where the receiving parachain is stalled, it's best to not have a lot of pending HRMP messages on the relay chain, since this will increase the load on the receiving parachain when it recovers.\n\nThe new limit will apply only to newly opened channels. This will not impact the channels that are already opened, which will keep the old limit. \n\nAlso this is just the default limit and it will apply to the channels opened via `establish_channel_with_system` for example. If a bigger limit is needed for an HRMP channel, there are extrinsics that can be used for setting a custom limit.\n\nWhitelisting referenda: https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/396",

RFC103 is a `PoV` replay protection mechanism that is mandatory to be implemented by parachains that will use multiple cores. \n\nWe have successfully enabled RFC103 on Kusama with [569](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/569). More details can be found in [this](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/elastic-scaling-wen-500ms-blocks/11971/4?u=sandreim) forum post.\n\nWhitelist: https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/390",

      "content": "## Description\n\nThere are two changes proposed here:\n1. A runtime upgrade of Coretime system chain to 1.6.0.\n2. Increasing the number of cores from 66 to 100.\n\nThe runtime upgrade is meant to fix the current Coretime [situation](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/april-2025-coretime-purchase/12526) on Polkadot. It does this by the following:\n\n1. We configure a minimum price of 10 DOT, to prevent prices to drop to unreasonable low values, which cause the system to take forever to recover in case demand picks up.\n2. Renewals are now no longer completely decoupled from the market, but will be adjusted to cost at least the end price of the current sale. Immediate effect will be that renewals will be adjusted to the minimum price too.\n\nDetails are outlined in https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/149.\n\nSome fellowship members had a call with all parachain teams describing changes of RFC-149 in detail and from what I know they were on board and want the coretime issue get fixed.\n\nThe enactment block of the proposal was chosen to be https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/26803000.\nNote however, that both changes will take place in the next sale period after the enactment, which is around July 25/26.\n\n## Build\n\n```\nopengov-cli build-upgrade --network polkadot --only --coretime \"1.6.0\"\n# modify the build call to 0x630004000100b50f04082f0000060202eb4353e21a0600a428020800095b5a86cc8055e729b7b8660f2f551d8bfe6712b24d2e637a0624444addcc8d2e32128c00\nopengov-cli submit-referendum \\\n    --proposal \"0x630004000100b50f04082f0000060202eb4353e21a0600a428020800095b5a86cc8055e729b7b8660f2f551d8bfe6712b24d2e637a0624444addcc8d2e32128c00\" \\\n    --network \"polkadot\" --track whitelistedcaller --at 26803000\n```",

      "title": "Assigning Coretime to Xcavate and Mythical",
      "content": "Both Mythical and Xcavate currently own bulk Coretime. However, both have missed the opportunity to renew their core. The problem is that someone bought all the cores because they [think that the current price per core is too low](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/april-2025-coretime-purchase/12526). While the assessment is correct that the price per core is too low and tries to draw more attention to the topic, this should not be done at the expense of existing parachains. Without Coretime, parachains will not be able to produce blocks. I contacted the Coretime buyer via mail and asked to buy two cores for 200 DOT per core. The Coretime buyer requested $150K USD for one core. This demonstrates that the Coretime buyer is ultimately just a scammer who is not genuinely interested in improving the Coretime system. As I and others want to ensure that Mythical and Xcavate are able to produce blocks, I'm opening this whitelisting proposal. As a member of the Fellowship, I acknowledge the scamming attempt as a flaw in the Coretime protocol. I also opened an [issue](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/issues/142) to discuss potential improvements to the protocol, ensuring that reasonable projects always get access to Coretime and are protected from scammers. I and other members of the Fellowship will push for a fast change to ensure this kind of scamming does not occur again in the future. We also don't want to repeat this kind of proposal. It should be a one-off proposal to help these two parachains. For the future, we encourage every parachain to opt-in to the auto-renew feature of the Coretime chain. A proper guide for setting up this feature will soon be added to the Polkadot wiki.\n\nThe proposal will send two XCM messages to the Coretime chain. Each XCM message will request the relay chain to increase the core count from `62` to `66` cores. So, in total, `4` new cores will be added to the relay chain offering. The tasks `3369` (Mythical) and `3,413` (Xcavate) will both be assigned a lease for `~64` days. So, they will get around `~2` months of free Coretime. The last operation of each XCM message is to call `set_storage`. This `set_storage` call puts each parachain into the so-called `WorkPlan` for the next region. This ensures that both parachains will receive a core assignment in the next region.",

This was done using Chopsticks and Foundry for Polkadot and Ethereum respectively.\n\nSince the Ethereum side of snowbridge has no fallback governance or centralized escape hatches, it is critical to ensure that the upgrade does not affect the ongoing viability the gateway. In this regard, the fork tests in [ForkUpgrade202502.t.sol](https://github.com/Snowfork/snowbridge/blob/main/contracts/test/ForkUpgrade202502.t.sol) verify that cross-chain signalling is preserved.\n\n# Audits\n\nThe Ethereum contracts were audited at revision `cb05e1f8bf7018dfca42a8d93d73826a97c99100`, which includes the features described above. The audit report is still undergoing a QA process and will only be published some time later. We can provide a provisional audit report on request.",

      "content": "**Context**\n\nFollowing the execution of Referenda 1339, the attacker maliciously added their key as a proxy to the newly established sudo key, effectively freezing all associated PARA funds under the account. As a consequence, the new sudo key is unable to send transactions while the attacker retains sudo ownership. Additionally, the attacker has initiated unbonding on all six of our accounts, putting 200,000 DOT at risk. With only 8 days remaining to act, it is crucial to pass this referendum as soon as possible.\n\nTo address this issue, Referenda 1424 has been submitted. However, given the time remaining until unstaking concludes, we plan to execute a straightforward rebond call to restake the DOT. This will provide an additional 28 days for Referenda 1424 to be executed.\n\n**The addresses designated for rebonding DOT are:**\n\n14quGMw2tot6JxY2wSyk1Vc1uns3EmMRs2eQS2C66Mdv6uE9 19cnUyebu52RUt4Rt67brDmmnVdaDD37xdxKbaJ7tuLnLfu 16kTs7tsJ6tYYWAXSWDmm4vYnRTFPWEhXTk4rNCtbw6NRvte 16ZbwPMyrp9yTbPScDqm9btzcNVKKQ5MHcMQp4rA1ztF4sBA 1dMif8G4jrXsdPSkvF87uBfaiahh2EvC9fPnsi91v4i1xKC \n\n**The calldata link is:**\n[Link](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/extrinsics/decode/0x17031a02181a030001aa006b3de1565c48ade1c1f3b646090be49389327f6b214076e5d2bd2ba0fb0207130b005ce1171ad11a03000106926c6bab20739b8d4710e56a9ce6db7b0f67986a4f29664919620653f3a43507130f003e8eacc8b1021a030001fe5326ff816ac945120d53cffdd00919268032f0e478d40c23dea72a69e5366007130b00045771840e1a030001f60aa184555b35cfcd6dc246424240068da18dd1bfeefccf8d5a26713b9917f707130f00041ddcaa95031a0300011bba940dce8f85a0088315d47c39f4318a107cff37333206e40f227c90a3f6a007130b009a0e6d9d1f1a030001f82777e46281c5f5000af5dbb01fa41cdf0ff53ac4167b7297e386d834ff7c0e07130b009aa23d4702)\n",

      "content": "This referenda increases schedulerParams.lookahead value to 3.\nWhy this change is needed?\n\nscheduler.lookahead determines the size of the claim queue and at the moment is set to 2. The claim queue shows which parachains are about to be scheduled on a specific core. A value of two shows what will be scheduled for a window of two blocks.\n\nasyncBackingParams.allowedAncestryLen is an async backing parameter which determines the oldest relay parent a candidate can be built on. 2 here means that a candidate can be built on the latest know relay parent or the two relay parents before it. In total this gives a window of three blocks.\n\nSo we have got a discrepancy. Async backing will accept candidates based on three different blocks while the claim queue shows information only about two. Bumping schedulerParams.lookahead to 3 will correctly align these values.\n\nThe same change was executed on Kusama: https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/488\n\nLink to the whitelisting referenda on Collectives: https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/288",

      "content": "**Goal of the Proposal:**\n\n- To rebond all balances related to the attack.\n- The approach does not impact the sovereignty of the funds but delays availability of funds\n- It allows the Parallel team to win time and explore alternatives to regaining control of their parachain governance. \n\n**Context:**\n\nAn account took control over Parallel Fi governance, upgraded the parachain's runtime and used it to transfer out over DOT and USDT. The account executed a malicious runtime upgrade, introducing a custom \"sudo\" pallet, granting themselves administrative privileges on the parachain. Through the proxy account, they successfully transferred DOT from three of the parachain’s DOT staking ledger accounts to their account. To obfuscate the trail, the account moved assets across parachains: including from AssetHub USDT to Moonbeam (most channels between parachains have been closed by now). The account is still actively unstaking staked DOT through an added proxy.\n\nTo fix this a root proposal is needed: however given the time calculated until unstaking ends, might make a root proposal unsuccessful. This whitelisted proposal aims to issue a simple rebond call to restake the DOT to buy additional 28 days of time for Parallel: providing time for the team to look into options to regain control of its parachain governance. The addresses in which DOT is to be rebonded are:\n\n`14quGMw2tot6JxY2wSyk1Vc1uns3EmMRs2eQS2C66Mdv6uE9` (22.649 DOT) `19cnUyebu52RUt4Rt67brDmmnVdaDD37xdxKbaJ7tuLnLfu` (74.614 DOT) `16kTs7tsJ6tYYWAXSWDmm4vYnRTFPWEhXTk4rNCtbw6NRvte` (1.566 DOT) `16ZbwPMyrp9yTbPScDqm9btzcNVKKQ5MHcMQp4rA1ztF4sBA` (101.322 DOT) `1dMif8G4jrXsdPSkvF87uBfaiahh2EvC9fPnsi91v4i1xKC` (3.413 DOT)\n\nThese addresses hold Parallel Fi funds.\n\nCall data: [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/extrinsics/decode/0x1500160d02d721ec7d460998cc42686dbb0f57ea9d59f1e2380eaf371fd1fadb72ef3d817ce8000000010a000000).\n\nPreimage hash: [here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpolkadot-rpc.dwellir.com#/extrinsics/decode/0x0a00a10317031a02141a030001aa006b3de1565c48ade1c1f3b646090be49389327f6b214076e5d2bd2ba0fb0207130b0018f7c7a2cb1a03000106926c6bab20739b8d4710e56a9ce6db7b0f67986a4f29664919620653f3a43507130f00e0dadd4ca4021a030001fe5326ff816ac945120d53cffdd00919268032f0e478d40c23dea72a69e5366007130b002c14b9f50b1a030001f60aa184555b35cfcd6dc246424240068da18dd1bfeefccf8d5a26713b9917f707130f00f01b1c6682031a0300011bba940dce8f85a0088315d47c39f4318a107cff37333206e40f227c90a3f6a007130b000cea6ec41c).\n\nThis proposal, given its root need, has been submitted via Whitelisted Caller Track. A proposal to whitelist the submission is up for vote on Technical Fellowship as well. Please note that relay chain is **not** affected by this event but we aim to assist the Parallel parachain community in taking back control of these accounts. \n\nPlease make sure to review and vote at your convenience!",

By this referendum passing before the interlude ends, the current sale will be unaffected.\n\nThis is a high priority which must pass within 6.5 days to ensure the 5 cores on the open market are not sold at this unintended low price.

It is a follow up to \n[1143](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1143) and [1107](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1107) and is the last step in the transition of the Polkadot network to Agile Coretime.\n\nIt is set to enact at block [22602000](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/22602000) at the earliest, which falls just after 0900 UTC on 2024-09-19. This is to ensure that it will pass after 1143 even if this is highly backed.\n\nMore information about the calls:\nThe desired candidates and candidacy bond are set to 7 and 1000 DOT respectively to bring them in line with other Polkadot System Parachains.\n \nThe broker pallet is configured using the following config:\n```\n{\n  advanceNotice: 10\n  interludeLength: 50,400\n  leadinLength: 100,800\n  regionLength: 5,040\n  idealBulkProportion: 100.00%\n  limitCoresOffered: null\n  renewalBump: 3.00%\n  contributionTimeout: 5,040\n}\n```\nwhich is very similar to the configuration on the Kusama Coretime Chain, but with a longer lead-in period (and thus shorter fixed-price period at the end of the sale).\n\nThe sales are started with 5 cores on the open market and a target price of 10 DOT. This means that the price at the start of the lead-in period will be 100 DOT, decreasing according to the pricing curve through the lead-in period. This also means that leases ending in this period will be allowed to renew at 100 DOT.",

This move was tested with the KSM Treasury in [Kusama 370](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/370). This will enable new spend patterns like staged payouts, as demonstrated in [Kusama 382](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/382).\n2. It sets asset rates the same as [Polkadot 645](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/referenda/645), but under XCM v4. Normally, these should have been migrated with the switch to v4, but since the referendum was open when the upgrade happened, there was nothing (yet) to migrate.\n\nRequires whitelisting from the Fellowship.",

      "content": "This referendum is meant for enabling async-backing on polkadot, more information about what is async backing and what this parameter changes will do can be found here [async backing](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-async-backing)\n\nAll async backing logic will be enabled with polkadot runtime upgrade [1.2.0](https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/648), but in sync mode, parachains can produce block only at 12s rate.\n\nAfter this referendum parachains can decide to produce blocks at 6s rate, by following this guide https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-async-backing, but that is not mandatory, they will still run at 12s rate without any changes needed on their side.\n\nWhitelisted by: https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/102.\n\n## Testing done\n\nAsync backing has been running on Rococo since December 2023 and on Westend since February 2024 with all system parachains migrated to produce blocks at 6s rate and on kusama after https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/374\n\nOur final checklist enablement can be found here: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/3226\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Async backing runtime APIs come in polkadot runtime v1.2, which will get enacted with: https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/648, this referendum needs to be enacted after that.\n\n## Known issues\n\nNo critical issues are known at this moment, however  to make the transition smooth all validators need to be upgraded to a version higher that *v1.8*. There are still around 3-5% validators in the active set that are not upgraded, so when it is their turn to back they won't back anything, and if 3 out of 5 nodes are in the same backing group the group won't be  able to back the candidates it is assigned to. **Action** Un-upgraded validators please upgrade to something higher than 1.8 node version.\n\n",

      "content": "Similar to Kusama, our approach on Polkadot involves adjusting the `setOnDemandMaxQueueSize` to 500. This change stems from an observation on Rococo, where a parachain's batch call for about 5,000 orders in a block, combined with a surplus of on-demand cores, resulted in notably slow block import times, as detailed in [the reported issue](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/3051). As a temporary fix, we're limiting the total number of orders by modifying the configuration via `setOnDemandMaxQueueSize` to a smaller value, and for the initial launch, 500 is deemed a secure limit. Once a more permanent solution is implemented, the maximum number of orders can be reconsidered.\n",

It also combines the call from referendum 428 (which should be rejected) to update the minimum balances of sufficient assets to maintain their ratio with the DOT existential deposit. You can check the call hashes of the inner `xcm.send(..)` to verify.\n\nA few notes around scheduling:\n\n- The referendum is set to enact at block 19,466,900, which is 24 hours after the v1.1.0 release upgrade is scheduled to take place. This will be Tuesday 13 Feb. This is within the 28-day decision period so is dependent on passing in time. If it passes after that block, it will just enact immediately.\n- The sufficient asset minimum balance call is scheduled to enact 590 blocks *after* sending the message to authorize the Asset Hub upgrade. Since the authorization only allows one to submit the new runtime, and the upgrade takes 600 Relay Chain blocks, this will leave a minimum of 10 blocks where the ratio is different. Someone should submit the runtime in a timely manner to maintain consistency, but it should not cause major problems.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n",

      "content": "The proposal addresses a recent XCM issue where the `SetTopic` instruction in XCM programs conflicts with destinations set to default version 2. This mismatch lead to failed transactions. [Referendum 305](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/305) has successfully resolved the issue on Kusama. Now, this proposal sets its sights on Polkadot's relay chain, advocating for a similar adjustment by aligning the `safeXcmVersion` to v3 and ensuring it sends XCMs in the v3 format by default.\n\nThe mismatch in XCM versions can lead to issues between the relay chain and parachains. To resolve this, we propose setting the relay chain's safeXcmVersion to v3. This adjustment ensures that the relay chain will send XCMs in the v3 format by default.\n\nNote that the proposal has been submitted on the Whitelisted Caller track, meaning the Fellowship is also voting on a proposal (no. [56](https://collectives.subsquare.io/fellowship/referenda/56)) to whitelist the submission hash",

It is merely a 1 liner change to the former Polkadot runtime that was version 9430. \n\nThe enactment time is set to [this](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/17840000) block, which is roughly 2 days before the funds unlock from crowdloans. \n\nThe corresponding fellowship referendum to whitelist the call is [https://collectives.polkassembly.io/member-referenda/24](https://collectives.polkassembly.io/member-referenda/24).",

While collators execute state transitions by reading parachain data from disk locally, parachain validators must load state proofs into memory. Therefore, they should have a higher memory limit than collators. Otherwise, a parachain block that made full use of memory when executed by the collator could fail to be executed by validators. To fix this, we propose increasing the memory limit for PVF execution to 512MB.\n\nPlease note that a similar proposal has already been successfully executed in Kusama.

KSM will be a sufficient asset with a minimum balance of 0.01 KSM.\n\nThe \"owner\" of the asset is the account ID conversion of the path (expressed as a Multilocation) to the Kusama Relay Chain, i.e. the governance location of Kusama.\n\nThis registration by governance is part of the initialization of a Polkadot <> Kusama bridge. Future assets that are sent over the bridge will not need governance motions from the system Root origin. There is a [similar referendum](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/258) to register DOT on Kusama.\n\nA note about metadata: I discovered while testing that `force_set_metadata` is not included in the `SafeCallFilter`, so it cannot be executed over XCM. This will be fixed in [this PR](https://github.com/paritytech/cumulus/pull/3044). A follow up referendum can set the metadata (name: Kusama, symbol: KSM), however this is not necessary for functionality (and the asset identifier itself is expressive of the asset meaning).",

Note that the first transfers to the sovereign accounts of parachains 1,001 (Collectives) and 1,002 (Bridge Hub) are slightly greater than the 20 DOT channel deposit.
