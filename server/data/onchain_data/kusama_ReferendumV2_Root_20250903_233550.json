      "title": "SEE UPDATE: Acquisition of dUSD stablecoin for Kusama treasury on Asset Hub and set dUSD as a Sufficient Asset",
      "content": "**Proposer:** Decent Partners\n\n**Date:** May 2025\n\n**Track:** Root (decision deposit will be placed at resolution of [#522](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/522))\n\n**Requested amount:** 25k KSM held in [Asset Hub treasury](https://assethub-kusama.subscan.io/account/HWZmQq6zMMk7TxixHfseFT2ewicT6UofPa68VCn3gkXrdJF)\n\n**Total exchanged:** ~400k dUSD ($16 KSM EMA30)\n\n## Summary\n\nWe propose a structured approach for the Kusama Treasury to obtain native dUSD issued by [Brale](https://brale.xyz/stablecoins/dUSD) on Asset Hub, for the purpose of diversification, enabling expenses to be paid out in a stable asset and to recirculate yield back into the ecosystem.\n\nThis proposal is to convert a slightly forgotten 25k KSM in Asset Hub treasury to dUSD via Asset Hub’s asset conversion pallet through a DCA mechanism over the course of five weeks creating ~$400k.\n\nAs the main KSM LP in the pool was provided by the Kusama treasury, the community will recoup ~50% of the 0.3% pool fees (note LP shares are currently received by Brale, who will send them on as they accrue).\n\nThe proposal also includes making dUSD a Sufficient Asset (as USDC/T are on Polkadot) so that the stablecoin can be used to pay transaction fees and exist on accounts without KSM.\n\nWe are bundling the DCA and sufficiency request into a single proposal as both require the Root track and large 3,333 KSM submission deposit.\n\n## Further reading:\n\n- [Brale announcement](https://brale.xyz/blog/introducing-dusd-on-kusama-with-decent-partners)\n- [Kusama twitter coverage](https://x.com/kusamanetwork/status/1917581420983210244).\n\n## Background\n\nStablecoins allow the treasury to diversify risk, reduce volatility for proposals and enable more predictable financing for the network.\n\nUniquely, Brale’s platform enables partners like Decent to launch branded stablecoins and benefit from a share of yield that can be recirculated as public goods, rather than being extracted and privatised as with Circle/USDC.\nTechnical approach\n\nThe referendum uses Asset Hub’s asset conversion and scheduler pallets to create a simple DCA feature that converts KSM to dUSD stablecoins that are then spendable by the treasury.\n\nA fixed amount of KSM is sold per trade rather than acquiring a fixed amount of dUSD.\n\n## DCA schedule parameters\n\n- Total duration: 5 weeks and 6 days\n- Total amount: 25,000 KSM\n- Trade frequency: One trade every 600 blocks (approx. 60 minutes)\n- Trade total: 1000 trades\n- Per trade: 25 KSM\n- Per day: 600 KSM\n- Destination: Kusama treasury account on Asset Hub\n- Total fee estimation: 0.15% of total amount (50% of LP fees returning to the community/treasury.)\n\n## Fee structure\n\nStablecoin acquisition is performed natively and without intermediaries on Asset Hub through the KSM:dUSD pool which operates with 0.3% fees to LPs. There are no collator fees.\n\nThe treasury provided the initial KSM liquidity ([ref #428](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/474)) with Brale providing dUSD meaning Kusama community/treasury will receive 50% of fees.\n\nWith the recoup this leaves a 0.15% fee.\n\n## Treasury LP share\n\nNote the original plan was for the KSM and dUSD to be added separately, but Asset Conversion Pallet’s logic needs a single account to add liquidity as noted in [ref 480](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referendawish471).\n\nThe short term solution was for Brale to manage the pool directly and add both KSM and dUSD and to send the LP shares back as they accrue.\n\nA longer term solution is in the works which will enable the addition of single sided liquidity when contracts are live on Kusama Asset Hub, meaning these shares can be received by the treasury directly.\n\n## Pool management fee\n\nOwing to the inability to add dUSD and KSM separately Brale took on overall management of the pool.\n\nThey charge a fixed $1000 monthly fee for rebalancing the pool.\n\nThis is the subject of a separate contract with Decent Partners.\n\nWe have settled the fees to date (March/April) by reallocating unused KSM from the KSM:dUSD liquidity proposal.\n\nThis reallocation also covered currency loss on [ref 471](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/471) so we avoided needing to top up from the treasury.\n\n[See full transaction list and calculations.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13TuYevRunyg2SeE6WV4OMPYf8CHdu9Yspr8VLH_m-sQ/edit?gid=1115641577#gid=1115641577)\n\nThere will be a future proposal by Decent Partners to cover these monthly ongoing costs until we have a solution for adding KSM liquidity directly when contracts are live.\n\n## Making dUSD Sufficient\n\nAssets on Kusama can be Sufficient or Non-Sufficient.\n\nBy making dUSD sufficient the currency can be used to directly pay fees and execute transactions on Asset Hub and beyond.\n\nTo hold a Non-Sufficient asset in a Kusama Asset Hub wallet address, a corresponding Kusama Asset Hub account needs to exist on-chain. This is different from other chains, where a wallet address can hold other tokens by default.\n\nOn Kusama Asset Hub, users need to ensure that the receiving wallet address holds at least 0.00000333 KSM, which is the Existential Deposit for establishing a Kusama Asset Hub account, prior to sending additional assets to the address.\n\nSufficient assets can also establish a Kusama Asset Hub account, such that the Existential Deposit in KSM is not necessary.\n\nSufficiency for dUSD will improve accessibility and user experience for existing and arriving projects.\n\n## dUSD Integrations and Updates\n\nWith the treasury funded Brale integration ([ref #471](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/471)) into Kusama Asset Hub, the issuance of the US regulated decent/dUSD stablecoin (asset ID [50000002](https://taniko.soda.zone/assets/urn:ocn:kusama:1000/50000002)), the launch of the KSM:dUSD [liquidity pool](https://kheopswap.xyz/#/kusama/pools) and integration into a number of established and emerging projects like [Kreivo](https://virto.team/), [Bloque](https://bloque.app/) ([ref 499](https://kusama.subsquare.io/treasury/proposals/437)), [Kippu](https://kippu.rocks/) (W3F grant recipient) and [Kwickbit](https://kwickbit.com/) ([Decentralized Futures recipient](https://medium.com/web3foundation/decentralized-futures-introducing-kwickbit-62016c8d3343)), Kusama now has native infrastructure for developing a regenerative and incentives aligned on-chain economy.\n\nAlongside this, Brale have just announced their IO product - a new [zero fee stablecoin onramp](https://brale.xyz/blog/introducing-io-from-brale-in-alpha) allowing simple, fee-less purchases of dUSD directly on Kusama Asset Hub.\n\nThere will soon be a permission-less Asset Hub based stablecoin exchange from the Bloque team to run alongside their VISA debit card issuance platform that will enable proposal beneficiaries to easily receive dUSD from the treasury and off-ramp to USDC and/or bank accounts.\n\nWe also expect a Polkadot native integration of Brale's issuance platform to go live in the next couple of months.\n\n## Regulatory news\n\nAs highlighted by Parity/W3F on the Kusamarian's [Regulatory Rewind](https://www.youtube.com/live/Jpo6-JZtX8E?si=rYPTs5X2tYMRbAw7&t=768), the UK has recently announced a regulatory exemption for foreign stablecoin issuers like Brale as part of closer co-operation with the US in regulating the emerging global market for digital assets including a ‘transatlantic sandbox’ creating conditions for broader adoption of the technology.\n\nThe clarification around regulation and the US exemption opens the door to dUSD being more easily adopted by developers, companies and users, creating a platform for future innovation. \n\n## About Brale, dUSD and Decent Partners\n\nBrale is a US regulated issuer of stablecoins. Unlike Circle (USDC) and Tether (USDT) stablecoins, Brale shares yield on the underlying reserves with community partners in line with adoption.\n\nUSD yield is paid to the Decent Partners organisation on Kreivo (note this UI is being superceded by new work) where it creates a treasury derived from dUSD adoption that can be recirculated into the ecosystem rather than be extracted by private entities.\n\nDecent Partners is a UK based company.",

      "content": "**This Referendum can be moved to Treasurer track. This will keep the Root track available for other important referenda.**\n\n\nThanks to Polkadot ecosystem's Interoperability and Cross Consensus Messaging through Polkadot \\<> Kusama trustless bridge, DOT can be accessed directly on Kusama. At the time of creating this post, there is around 4900+ DOT on Kusama. You can query the chain state to get the accurate number\n\n![DOT on Kusama](https://i.ibb.co/ns9n8dXs/mdx-Editor-Radha-1746308625297.png)\n\nIt is possible to send DOT to Kusama Treasury and access it through Kusama OpenGov. For the treasury tracks on Kusama to work as expected, a proper spend limits in terms of DOT need to be set. For this purpose, the asset rate parameter is used. For instance, DOT/USDC/USDT conversion rates were set on Polkadot through [referendum 645](https://polkadot.subscan.io/referenda_v2/645?tab=preimage\\&focus=post), which allowed for Polkadot OpenGov to spend USDT/USDC directly through its treasury tracks.\n\nIt is worth noting that the current asset rate for DOT/USDC and DOT/USDT on Polkadot is 1 DOT = 10 USDC/T. This should not be confused as the actual exchange rate of the assets. Instead, the asset rate just applies this factor to adhere to spend limits. This rate can be adjusted through governance if the actual rate diverges too much.\n\nIn that light, the asset rate of 1 KSM = 4 DOT is reasonable to set, which translates to an asset rate of 25. We understand it is a bit counter intuitive. Please check the explanation below which converts assets into the smallest units (plancks) represnted on-chain:\n\n* 1 KSM = 1000,000,000,000 (hence KSM token has 12 decimals)\n* 1 DOT = 10,000,000,000 (hence DOT token has 10 decimals)\n* 4 DOT = 40,000,000,000 when multiplied by 25 results in 1000,000,000,000 units which are interpreted as 1 KSM by Kusama OpenGov treasury tracks",

This should not be confused as the actual exchange rate of the assets. Instead, the asset rate just applies this factor to adhere to spend limits. This rate can be adjusted through governance if the actual rate diverges too much.\n\nIn that light, the asset rate of 1 KSM = 4 DOT is reasonable to set, which translates to an asset rate of 25. We understand it is a bit counter intuitive. Please check the explanation below which converts assets into the smallest units (plancks) represnted on-chain:\n\n* 1 KSM = 1000,000,000,000 (hence KSM token has 12 decimals)\n* 1 DOT = 10,000,000,000 (hence DOT token has 10 decimals)\n* 4 DOT = 40,000,000,000 when multiplied by 25 results in 1000,000,000,000 units which are interpreted as 1 KSM by Kusama OpenGov treasury tracks",

      "content": "# Setting a realistic target for coretime sales\n\n## Background\n\nThis proposal aims to adjust the parameter that controls the ideal target for coretime sales to a value that better reflects the expected demand of Kusama cores. This change will help stop coretime prices from being driven to near-zero and instead drive prices to a more realistic value, benefiting the Kusama ecosystem.\n\nThe main utility of KSM is to pay for coretime (which gets burned), but current prices are virtually 0, making it hard for the system to benefit from its main product offering. Elastic scaling will help grow demand for coretime and thus KSM, and there might also be new sources of KSM demand like Kreivo's memberships, but we need to adjust the core business model.\n\n## Proposed Change\n\nThis proposal focuses solely on adjusting the `ideal_bulk_proportion` parameter:\n\n* Setting `ideal_bulk_proportion`: From `100%` to `40%`\n\n> The proportion of cores available for sale which should be sold.  \n> If more cores are sold than this, then further sales will no longer be considered in determining the sellout price. In other words, the sellout price will be the last price paid, without going over this limit.\n\n## Rationale\n\nA previous proposal ([Referendum 507](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/507)) included both this parameter change and an inflation reduction. However, community feedback, particularly from validators, raised concerns about the inflation reduction component. Validators expressed that reducing inflation would make validator operations unprofitable, potentially harming network decentralization and security.\n\nThis modified proposal addresses those concerns by focusing only on the coretime sales parameter, which has received broader support. By setting a more realistic target for bulk coretime sales (40% instead of 100%), we can help discover coretime's true value while maintaining the current inflation rate that supports validator operations.\n\nNote that this number is not set in stone; it's a starting point that can help us better discover coretime's true value. The parameter can be adjusted in the future based on market response and ecosystem needs.\n\n## Future Considerations\n\nThis proposal is part of a broader effort to optimize Kusama's economic parameters. A future proposal focused on inflation may be developed in collaboration with validators to ensure any changes to inflation include conditions for newly minted KSM that benefit both validators and the broader ecosystem.\n\nAs a Kusama community member, I believe this focused change represents a balanced approach that addresses immediate concerns while setting the stage for future improvements.\n",

      "content": "# Reducing Inflation\nSome time has passed since our wild cousin Polkadot successfully reduced its annual inflation to 8%(with gradual reduction), as a KSM token holder I believe our loved bird is due an adjustment of its inflation parameters as well. Instead of copy-pasting Polkadot's model, Kusama can try something different, some DOT holders were left wondering if inflation could be lower, I propose we reduce it to 5%. The high initial inflation was good for early bootstrapping and incentivizing participation, the ecosystem has matured enough to aim for long-term sustainability.\n\n## Changed parameters\n- Setting `MaxInflation`: From `10%` to `5%`\n- `UseAuctionSlots`: From `true` to `false`.  \n  From the [docs](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/v1.4.2/relay/kusama/src/lib.rs#L687): \n  > With the move to agile-coretime, this parameter does not make much sense and should generally be set to false.\n\n**NOTE:** As `IdealStake` is \"75%\", `UseAuctionSlots = true` had the effect of making the *real* target around 45%, this is intentional as it would increase the treasury income to around 10% with current staking levels.\n\n![inflation.png](https://subsquare.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPLVu1AjKvG9eekJets2BxHLn6bK5kfYP3KWJ7hsQbucK)\n\n\n# Reducing ideal bulk coretime sales\nThe reduction of inflation should be balanced with an increased demand for the KSM, the main utility of KSM is to pay for coretime(which gets burned) but current prices are virtually 0 making it hard for the system to benefit from its main product offering. Elastic scaling will help grow demand for coretime and thus KSM, there might also be new sources of KSM demand like [Kreivo's memberships](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/sustainability-model-of-a-tokenless-protocol/8683) but we need to adjust the core business model.\n\nA while back I [proposed setting a minimum price](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/469) but it was pointed out by @seadanda that a better approach is to change the parameter that controls the ideal target for sales to a value that better reflects the expected demand of the Kusama cores to stop the price from further being driven to 0 and quite the opposite drive its price up to a more realistic value.\n\nNote that this number is not set in stone, it's a starting point that can help us better discover coretime's true value.\n\n## Changed parameters\n- Setting `ideal_builk_proportion`: From `100%` to `40%`\n\n>The proportion of cores available for sale which should be sold.\nIf more cores are sold than this, then further sales will no longer be considered in determining the sellout price. In other words the sellout price will be the last price paid, without going over this limit.\n\n---\nAs self-proclaimed Kusama enthusiast#1, not only as KSM-only holder but as full-time exclusive builder on this network for several years, I hope this proposal well received and not seen as malicious as I only have the best intentions for this ecosystem :)",

      "content": "Acala Foundation have registered para id 2233 and won a parachain slot auction by bidding with the intention to use the new lease to renew Karura para lease.\n\nHowever, due to historical reasons and missing migrations, para id 2233 is locked and in a bad state that can only be managed by root track.\n\nIn order to fix the bad state and improve the parachain lock mechanism to ensure this cannot happen in future, I have proposed [RFC-14](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/pull/14). A draft implementation is also implemented: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/pull/7560.\n\nBut Polkadot Fellowship is still on the process of taking over the ownership of Polkadot runtime, which slows everything down. We do not know if the RFC-14 can be accepted, implemented, and enacted before lease 32 ends.\n\nAs a result, I would like to perform a lease swap between Karura (Para ID 2000) and Para ID 2233 with root track. \n\nOnce RFC-14 is enacted, we would be able to self-service the lease swap in future and other parachain teams will be less likely require root track governance intervene for least swap or state update.",

          "content": "> We propose to increase identity registration and make the process efficient by more than 75%. Easy UX, safer ecosystem! \n\n\nPolkassembly is an integral part of Polkadot and Kusama governance. It is dedicated to fostering transparent governance and active participation within the Kusama and Polkadot ecosystems. The team is excited to announce its application to become a registrar.\n\nOn-chain identities in the Polkadot ecosystem are crucial for trust, accountability, and interoperability. By establishing unique digital fingerprints, participants can securely interact within the network. An on-chain identity fosters a reliable and verifiable framework for participants within the Polkadot ecosystem, which is governed by a defined set of rules. It enables seamless integration and collaboration between different projects and stakeholders.\n\nIt also builds accountability as the participants are vetted and there are multiple points of contact for an individual/team. Hence, when requesting funds or proposing changes, the network and its resources have an additional layer of protection via the verification process. \n\nThe goal of setting an on-chain identity is to enhance transparency, security, and the overall ease of interaction between the participants of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.\n\n**Problems in current on chain identity system**\n\n- The current process for verifying the identity is extremely fragmented\n- The process requires a heavy reliance on navigating through PolkadotJS, which can be overwhelming to those who are new to the ecosystem\n- Twitter, Element and email verification is done manually and the process is very complicated for any user. The verification process also relies on availability of the registrar, creating further friction in the process. \n- The process is also broken away from the governance and proposal creation interface, which makes it difficult for a lot of the community as they need to adapt to multiple tools for serving different use cases\n\n\n**Objective for Registrar Application**\n\n- The primary objective of creating the registrar application is to build an easy and integrated governance experience for all users within Polkassembly. \n- This involves building for automation of proposal creation, addition of education nudges on proposal evaluation, verification of on chain identities and comprehensive user level profiling with leaderboards and gamification for governance participants\n- Taking the onus for ensuring verification of users and building security for funds requested from treasury\n- All teams requesting funds should be able to create an onchain identity, verify themselves and use our product suite to create a multisig (via Polkasafe or any other publicly available multisig SDK) when requesting for funds\n- The time required for identity registration and verification will be reduced by more than 75%, enhancing the adoption of the feature and enabling a more robust and secure treasury management. \n\nEfficiency improvement of 75% was deduced by using the average time difference between the two methods for 3 unique users\n- The time required by the earlier method was 20-25 mins, and via Polkassembly will be approximately 5 mins\n \n\n**Why is Polkassemby uniquely positioned for this application?**\n\n- We believe that leveraging the right set of prompts and experiences, we can ensure teams are adopting the on chain identity feature set provided by the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems \n- Polkassembly has continuously been working on differentiating its experience for proposal creators, governance participants, and networks and the verification of on chain identities can be a critical step towards the success of this initiative\n- Polkassembly has also been developing an extended feature set which will allow for an end to end experience \n- Creation of opengov proposals directly via the platform, in a simple and user friendly way\n- Observing locked, available and transferable balances while ensuring an easy mechanism to unlock bonded tokens\n- A super powerful delegation ecosystem, where track level delegation is  easy and helps build accountability for teams receiving delegations\n- Voting based on verification of credentials and track record of individuals and their contributions to the ecosystem\n\n**How will Polkassemby enable users to apply for on chain identity verification?**\n\nAttached below is a step wise explanation of how Polkassembly plans to receive and process on chain delegations \n\n**Step 1** - \nDiscovery on on chain identity setup\nUsers will be provided with contextual nudges on Polkassembly for setting up on chain identity\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/J3kBSVd/2-premiurly-1686908742146.png)\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/NFDMvtD/2-premiurly-1686908782463.png)\n\n**Step 2** - \nEducating users on what is on chain identity and why is it important\n- Explaining the process of setting up and on chain identity and how verification works\n- Helping users understand how to identify users with a valid on chain identity\n- Clear communication on the total amount required (Please note the amount mentioned is representative and may vary based on market conditions)\n- The breakdown of the feed will also be provided\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/VN7DkWT/2-premiurly-1686908809370.png)\n\n**Step 3 **- \nProviding the user with an interface to share all their social and contact information\n\n- The user will be allowed to choose any one of their address which they want to verify\n- They can choose their legal and display name\n- They can identify their social handles for further communication with the community\n- They are informed about the bond, which is mandatory while setting up an on chain identity \n- They are also informed about the fees charged for setting up or changing the social handles, which will be the fee per handle * # of handles being verified \n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/mzVVfyj/2-premiurly-1686908855717.png)\n\n**Step 4** -\nConfirming the fees and initiating the step by step identity verification process\n\n- Each social handle will need to be independently verified after the input is provided \n- Once all verifications are completed the success states will be provided\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/7V4DK76/2-premiurly-1686908890788.png)\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/N9MrHHV/2-premiurly-1686908932198.png)\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/9rjw3NR/2-premiurly-1686908948205.png)\n\n**Step 5** -\nThe team will complete verification for the provided credentials and share an update over email for the candidate. \n\nThe tentative process will be as follows - \n- Website liveness will be checked using https://helloacm.com/tools/can-visit/ or a similar tool. \n- Email verification would be a verification link based hence removing a lot of manual steps involved currently. \n- Element & Twitter verification will be done using their APIs, again automating the process and removing manual steps of using polkadot.js and DMing registrars for verification. \n- Once the data is verified, there will be an final approval from registrar for a few days\n- (This will be eliminated permanently, completely automating the process and making it permissionless)\n\n\n\nFull Proposal [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wYkC09wMjC6KstW2E9VtHLgoRd1bV_GLhYoTOQ8gv8U/edit)",

      "title": "Moving a paraid to a new manager address - Kabocha",
      "content": "EDIT - *No-one has objected, so I'm going to go ahead with this.*\n\nEDIT AGAIN - Passed and executed correctly.  Thank you to everyone who supported it!\n\nI'm interested in the communities views on whether the following is technically feasible and whether they would likely support it, please.\n\nWe're coming to the end of the Kabocha parachain lease (paraid 2113), and we've secured another lease on another paraid (2268).  Unfortunately, I hadn't realised that the parathread would instantly upgrade to a parachain and lock lease swaps, so we're going to need to use a root referendum to resolve it.\n\nHowever, there are a few other longer term issue that we'd like to resolve at the same time, if possible.  The current paraid is on a regular single owner account.  We'd like to move it to another account - probably a pure proxy so we can update control of the account as key people move in and out of the project.  I believe there isn't currently a way to update the manager of a paraid?\n\nWith that in mind, and noting that Kabocha will revert to a parathread in a few days, I'd like to set up a root track referendum that does the following in a batch (in order):\n\n1. registrar.deregister(2113) - release the paraid from the current holder and free the reserved balance.\n\n<wait 2 epoch for offboarding>\n\n2. registrar.forceRegister() - with the pure proxy account, standard 280.3KSM deposit (see below), paraid 2113, and the head hash and validation_code at the point where Kabocha stops making blocks (not yet known).\n\n<wait 2 epoch for onboarding - might not be strictly necessary>\n\n3. registrar.swap(2113,2268)\n4. registrar.swap(2268,2113)\n\nMy assumption is that this will move the paraid to the new account, offboard 2268 and onboard 2113 as parachains, and Kabocha should start making blocks again.  Is there anything fundamentally wrong with this assumption?  Or, indeed, is it too complex for the community to allow, perhaps?\n\nValidation wise, we can set remarks from the accounts involved (the current manager accounts for the two paraids and the new pure proxy), to confirm intent.  Is this sufficient?\n\n[About Kabocha, for anyone not familiar](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-kabocha-an-experimental-kusama-parachain-incubated-by-the-edgeware-community/327)\n\n\nEDIT to add **validation on-chain remarks**\n\n[Paraid 2268 manager account](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18149800-2)\n\n[New paraid 2113 manager account, via proxy](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18149835-2)\n\n[Old paraid 2113 manager account](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18154737-2)\n\n\nEDIT to add **notes on deposit for forceRegister()**\n\nThe fee for setting the parachain PVF and head is just under 280.3KSM (this is more than the fee when Kabocha was first registered).  I will use the current fee in the forceRegister() extrinsic.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/RpQRz5S/4031-jelliedowl-1685570490210.png)\n\nEDIT: In case it's useful for anyone in future - this is the preimage I used:\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/jLtPpdB/4031-jelliedowl-1687038852464.png)",

          "content": "EDIT - *No-one has objected, so I'm going to go ahead with this.*\n\nI'm interested in the communities views on whether the following is technically feasible and whether they would likely support it, please.\n\nWe're coming to the end of the Kabocha parachain lease (paraid 2113), and we've secured another lease on another paraid (2268).  Unfortunately, I hadn't realised that the parathread would instantly upgrade to a parachain and lock lease swaps, so we're going to need to use a root referendum to resolve it.\n\nHowever, there are a few other longer term issue that we'd like to resolve at the same time, if possible.  The current paraid is on a regular single owner account.  We'd like to move it to another account - probably a pure proxy so we can update control of the account as key people move in and out of the project.  I believe there isn't currently a way to update the manager of a paraid?\n\nWith that in mind, and noting that Kabocha will revert to a parathread in a few days, I'd like to set up a root track referendum that does the following in a batch (in order):\n\n1. registrar.deregister(2113) - release the paraid from the current holder and free the reserved balance.\n\n<wait 2 epoch for offboarding>\n\n2. registrar.forceRegister() - with the pure proxy account, standard 280.3KSM deposit (see below), paraid 2113, and the head hash and validation_code at the point where Kabocha stops making blocks (not yet known).\n\n<wait 2 epoch for onboarding - might not be strictly necessary>\n\n3. registrar.swap(2113,2268)\n4. registrar.swap(2268,2113)\n\nMy assumption is that this will move the paraid to the new account, offboard 2268 and onboard 2113 as parachains, and Kabocha should start making blocks again.  Is there anything fundamentally wrong with this assumption?  Or, indeed, is it too complex for the community to allow, perhaps?\n\nValidation wise, we can set remarks from the accounts involved (the current manager accounts for the two paraids and the new pure proxy), to confirm intent.  Is this sufficient?\n\n[About Kabocha, for anyone not familiar](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/introducing-kabocha-an-experimental-kusama-parachain-incubated-by-the-edgeware-community/327)\n\n\nEDIT to add **validation on-chain remarks**\n\n[Paraid 2268 manager account](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18149800-2)\n\n[New paraid 2113 manager account, via proxy](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18149835-2)\n\n[Old paraid 2113 manager account](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/18154737-2)\n\n\nEDIT to add **notes on deposit for forceRegister()**\n\nThe fee for setting the parachain PVF and head is just under 280.3KSM (this is more than the fee when Kabocha was first registered).  I will use the current fee in the forceRegister() extrinsic.\n\n![image](https://i.ibb.co/RpQRz5S/4031-jelliedowl-1685570490210.png)",

      "title": "Kusama Treasury Staking Configuration",
      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI have proposed a very exciting root track referendum that will effectively increase the Treasury's revenue by ~43,000 KSM per year. This solution is totally decentralized, autonomous, and, most importantly, can be enacted without needing to issue a `system.setCode` call to upgrade to a custom runtime. I can't afford the decision deposit myself, so I'm calling on anyone with enough liquid KSM to place the deposit if you want this to be considered by the ecosystem.

[**Here**](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x3307a76ee737f5374e5e397d3eedcf4ee75b394001aa8da5bf862e086dc29ea8) is the call that removed my account as a delegate for each one. [**Here**](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/0x087e02a033404fb175329ccd4d012f68c57d78ad022ab6a3d1179c87a6e9e1d3) is the call that confirms that I indeed do not have control of the proxies.\n\nThe reason for the proxy configuration is that the Treasury itself can't join multiple nomination pools, so to achieve thorough decentralization we need to utilize proxy accounts that are only controlled by the Treasury. And even if we wanted the Treasury to join just one pool, 270,000 KSM in one pool would yield very inefficient rewards since each validator in the pool would be nominated with way more than the average.\n\nI hand-selected these pools because they are maintained by people and organizations that have a good track record and are clearly here to stay. If a pool starts misbehaving, it will be quite easy to get a referendum passed to unbond from that pool and join another. This selection is the only potentially biased decision made in this process but I hope the ecosystem can trust my judgment - I really tried to be as unbiased as possible.\n\nThe amounts are what I believe to be a good balance between liquidity and passive revenue. With the Society funds, the Treasury only needs to offer up about half its free balance to these pools. If the community believes the Treasury needs to be more liquid, we can simply pass a referendum to unbond a certain amount from each pool and transfer the funds back to the Treasury. Remember *these funds are not being spent*. They are being staked.\n\nJust a quick note, the reason for the 30,001 KSM balance transfers but only 30,000 KSM being joined to a pool is because an account cannot dip below the existential balance while joining a nomination pool. These 9 KSM will be returned to the Treasury when the first reward claim is enacted by the scheduler. I know I enlivened the proxies with existential balances after I made them, but it's best to be redundant.\n\nFinally, the scheduler call is scheduled for Block #17,798,400 because I wanted to make sure that it would get scheduled even if this referendum took the maximum time possible, i.e. 432,000 blocks from the next spend period which starts at block #17,366,400. The maximum time this referendum could take is equal to 5 spend periods, so **the Treasury would receive its first RoS sometime around May 6th**. Also, the scheduled calls have a priority of `49` to ensure there's enough higher priorities for other scheduled calls and repeats 333 times to ensure automated payouts for the next few years.\n\n### Projected Effects\n\nBefore we get into projections, I want to address a *very* annoying bug in polkadot.js that probably hurts the ecosystem's marketability. The app uses [**`api.query.auctions.auctionCounter`**](https://github.com/polkadot-js/apps/blob/master/packages/react-hooks/src/useInflation.ts#L54) to calculate the ideal staking proportion in the ecosystem. This is wrong and it's [**not what the runtime does**](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/blob/master/runtime/kusama/src/lib.rs#L517). By using `api.query.auctions.auctionCounter` you're querying the *total* number of auctions that have ever happened - currently at 76. Since this is greater than the max of 60 parachains allocated 30% of the supply, the app defaults to 60 in its ideal staking calculation. In other words, it takes that whole 30% allocation away from 75% to get an ideal staking proportion of 45%. That's why it shows ~10% RoS because that's what you get when you plug those numbers into [**the inflation rate formula**](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/overview/2-token-economics.html). If you use the *correct* number of 43 non-system parachains and account for the 270,000 KSM throwing the total staked proportion off-kilter, you get an RoS closer to 16%. I can perform the math if anyone wants confirmation.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, if we estimate the expected revenue with the ecosystem average return on staking of 16% (rewards not compounding), we get ~118 KSM per day in revenue, or 0.00822 KSM per block on average. [**Based on my analysis of the Treasury over 1.2 million blocks**](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/kusama-treasury-analysis-reconfiguration/2484), the average revenue per block is currently at 0.0166. Therefore:\n\n**This referendum will instantly increase the Treasury's revenue by ~50%.**\n\nIt will be interesting to see what this number actually ends up being if this referendum passes. Needless to say, I think everyone can agree that if this can be done, it definitely should.\n\n### Follow-up Referenda\n\nThis referendum is the first step in a multi-referendum plan to stop the unsustainable decline of the Treasury's balance\n\n1. Give most Society funds to the Treasury and boost its revenue via nomination pools.\n2. As being discussed in [**this forum post**](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/kusama-treasury-analysis-reconfiguration/2484), we propose a custom runtime upgrade to change the spending tracks from general spending categories to topic-based spending tracks and restrict spending bandwidth.\n3. Assuming KSM's price increases in the next year or so, we strategically convert KSM to a stable asset, like USDT on Statemine, to bootstrap a stable Treasury on Statemine.\n\nThe first two steps are actionable and can be executed within the next 30 - 45 days. The 3rd step in this plan is where it gets vague, but that's only because it's far in the future and relies on variables that are out of our control. We would obviously monitor revenue, spending, and KSM price to ensure we are being prudent with Treasury management.\n\n### Potential Objections\n\n**Nomination pools aren't the solution for this, we should instead implement a Treasury staking pallet in the runtime.**\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this has been a topic of discussion for many months, *yet there has been no call to action or any real change in all that time*. Here is a solution that works *right now* and doesn't require a `system.setCode` call. If we strike this down, that's just more time the Treasury isn't earning this revenue. Enough pussyfooting, let's get a solution out *now* even if that solution isn't the best possible one.\n\n**I support this solution but I don't agree with the selection of the nomination pools.**\n\nOkay, [**then reconfigure the call**](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.ibp.network%2Fkusama#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) and pick 9 different pools. Want more pools? Then create more pure proxies in the same way I did, reconfigure the call, propose your own `root` track referendum, and leave it to the token holders to decide.\n\n**You don't have to use proxies to do this, there's a better batch of calls, the scheduler call could be better, etc.**\n\nLike I said above, just reconfigure the call and submit your own referendum then. This is *openGov* after all. If you have a better way of doing this, by all means, please show everyone how it's done.\n\n**There is a fundamental problem with using fees collected from transactions to secure the network via staking.**\n\nThis is something I've been pondering - is staking Treasury/ Society funds into the ecosystem a lot like a snake eating its own tail? I've come to the conclusion that no, recirculating \"burned\" funds back into staking doesn't hurt the security of the network. That's because the funds would otherwise eventually end up getting paid out to independent parties who would sell it on the open market. At the end of the day, these funds will eventually go back into circulation, so best to stake them across a decentralized set of validators.\n\n**How do you know that these calls will work?**\n\nPlease feel free to test these calls yourself by using Chopsticks and follow my testing environment documentation below. You can also verify these calls using different tools, whatever floats your boat. While I am very confident that these calls will work as expected it's always good to get more eyes and minds scrutinizing the technicalities.\n\n### Testing Environment\n\nBefore I could confidently propose this on chain, I had to make sure that every call worked exactly as intended.I decided to utilize [**Chopsticks**](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) because it seemed to be the easiest way to test exactly how Kusama works. I'm sure there are far more efficient ways of setting up a dev environment that can test Kusama, especially ones that don't require the workarounds I had to utilize, but I was shooting for convenience and speed. Since Kusama doesn't have a `Sudo` pallet and I couldn't figure out how to hardcode an account with root origin in the config.yml file, I had to be clever. In the process of finding workarounds I came to the important realization that **confirmed referenda on Kusama are nothing more than scheduled calls in the `scheduler`**. That means if I could hardcode the `scheduler.agenda` in the Chopsticks config, I could simulate any successful referenda on Kusama. I needed to test the following:\n\n- Can `root` submit a `balances.forceTransfer` to move Society funds to the Treasury?\n- Can `root` submit a `utility.dispatchAs(signed,call)` on behalf of the Treasury?\n- Can the Treasury be a delegate of pure proxies?\n- Can `root` submit a `proxy.proxy` via `utility.dispatchAs(signed,call)` on behalf of the Treasury?\n- Can Treasury funds be staked to nomination pools using all of the above?\n- Will such large amounts joining the pools break the pools at all?\n- Can the Treasury automatically receive its rewards using all of the above? \n\nI obviously wouldn't have submitted this referendum on chain if any of these things weren't possible. Turns out `root` is really, really powerful! To test these things I had to hard code proxies, scheduled calls, preimages, and nomination pool rewards. I first focused on proxy configuration and joining nomination pools by adding the following under `import-storage` in the default `kusama.yml` file in Chopsticks:\n\n```\n  Proxy:\n    Proxies:\n      -\n        -

That's because Chopsticks only writes a new block when you submit an extrinsic. So all I needed to do to test this call was to submit a `system.remark`. By doing so, the Treasury successfully transferred 30,001 KSM to each pure proxy and joined 9 distinct pools via the scheduler. The pools remained open and the protocol also scheduled the desired reward claim.\n\nJust a note: the scheduler automatically requests its own calls' preimages so there is no need to explicitly store the preimage needed to claim pool rewards. \n\nI then tested whether the `claimPayout` + `transferAll` would work. I had some trouble hard coding the nomination pool to accommodate the massive claim, but got it figured out by adding the following to the default `kusama.yml` in Chopsticks:\n\n```\n  Proxy:\n    Proxies:\n      -\n        - [G8dY4RCzMW85s55GjubvUBQEGFqri7Y6BB3HhJN3QF6NYHS]\n        -\n          - \n            - delegate: F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29\n              proxyType: Any\n              delay: 0\n          - 668033331300\n  Preimage:\n    PreimageFor:\n      -\n        -\n           - ['0x6d4c5902a1a43810dfe33fa7c1e142392068c6af51f6788363173723b2c31712', 113]\n        - '0x180300016d6f646c70792f747273727900000000000000000000000000000000000000001e00009d5935861195dfc92a0e61ecfb09cc6016acbd90b16e8db292ca9a92d6cfcc570018040829020404006d6f646c70792f7472737279000000000000000000000000000000000000000001'\n    StatusFor:\n      -\n        - ['0x6d4c5902a1a43810dfe33fa7c1e142392068c6af51f6788363173723b2c31712']\n        - Unrequested:\n            deposit:\n              - 5FEejaLgafnvB64mmXnw4o7P4PsuWhpPpgw8neeVB5fj4j7P\n              - 1339233326100\n            len: 113\n  Scheduler:\n    Agenda:\n      -\n        - [17202800]\n        - \n          - maybeId: null\n            priority: 0\n            call:\n              Lookup:\n                _alias:\n                  hash_: hash\n                hash_: '0x6d4c5902a1a43810dfe33fa7c1e142392068c6af51f6788363173723b2c31712'\n                len: 113\n            maybePeriodic: null\n            origin:\n              system: Root\n  NominationPools:\n    BondedPools:\n      -\n        - [1]\n        - points: '30000000000000000'\n          state: Open\n          memberCounter: 66\n          roles:\n            depositor: E8a4iJyDLd2ZysHt4bWfg5VG3RwNfHqSZtkyt5SPNJpmYoq\n            root: E8a4iJyDLd2ZysHt4bWfg5VG3RwNfHqSZtkyt5SPNJpmYoq\n            nominator: Fc51t7QUm5sPhx6gJdxzVBjznqqoRyp2gHTJSnbRBcLExAo\n            stateToggler: GF5PrXFcW7YDKKKfgJsMJE9xKF1UgE64kVSWYxNNo7waZYe\n    RewardPools:\n      -\n        - [1]\n        - lastRecordedRewardCounter: '10000000000000000'\n          lastRecordedTotalPayouts: '5000000000000000'\n          totalRewardsClaimed: '2500000000000000'\n    PoolMembers:\n      -\n        - [G8dY4RCzMW85s55GjubvUBQEGFqri7Y6BB3HhJN3QF6NYHS]\n        - poolId: 1\n          points: '30000000000000000'\n          lastRecordedRewardCounter: 0\n          unbondingEras: {}\n  System:\n    Account:\n      -\n        -\n          - 5FEejaLgafnvB64mmXnw4o7P4PsuWhpPpgw8neeVB5fj4j7P\n        - data:\n            free: '10000000000000000000'\n      -\n        -\n          - G8dY4RCzMW85s55GjubvUBQEGFqri7Y6BB3HhJN3QF6NYHS\n        - data:\n            free: '1000000000000'\n      -\n        -\n          - F3opxRbN5ZavB4LTn2FZim9tPCHyvapGAAZzdDp5pzfg3sy #stash\n        - data:\n            free: '30000000000000000'\n      -\n        -\n          - F3opxRbN5ZavB4LTn2XJkJjzssVSUggzq75YZueYesPwk5J #reward\n        - data:\n            free: '30000000000000000'\n```\n\nI tested this with the same process as above. The reward was claimed successfully and transferred to the Treasury as expected. I only needed to prove the concept with one proxy since we can simply batch all the others.\n\nWith that, I confirmed that everything I hypothesized was absolutely possible on Kusama.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nThis referendum will configure 9 pure proxies controlled only by the Treasury to stake a total of 270,000 KSM across 9 nomination pools on behalf of the Treasury and pay out rewards to the Treasury every 6 days starting ~May 6th. Out of the 270,000 KSM, 120,000 KSM comes from the [**Society**](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/F3opxRbN5ZbbNGg1tFTKna9ymddEen74rNVr5JRPb3nRsXX) and 150,000 KSM comes from the [**Treasury**](https://kusama.subscan.io/account/F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29).\n\nBy staking these funds, we expect a projected revenue increase of ~43,000 KSM per year, which is approximately a 50% increase from what the Treasury is earning now.\n",

      "content": "Using a `batch` call, this Referendum aims to cancel proposals that have been approved by the community but have failed to enact on time due to UI misconfiguration.\n\nNamely, as we started to navigate OpenGov, it was brought to our attention that a misinterpretation of the parameter `after`, which is NOT an absolute block number but a delay expressed in blocks, implied that after approval, these referenda would take years to enact.\n\nAmong others, Referenda: [4](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/4), [5](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/5), [6](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/6), [7](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/7), [9](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/9), [10](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/10), [11](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda/referendum/11), currently sitting in the scheduler, are expected to be approved from 1025-1100 days from now.\n\nHowever, as the teams have already resubmitted their proposals with the updated parameters (see [referenda history](https://kusama.subsquare.io/referenda) of various tracks), I am bringing forward the following call to cancel the proposals and avoid any complications in the future.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/zGG0cDTX/Screenshot-2023-02-06-at-14-43-33.png)",

      "content": "Auctions on Kusama are scheduled using the Scheduler Pallet. [Referendum 72](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/72) was proposed on Kusama through root Track given that the Scheduler Pallet can’t be called by the Auctions Admin (this PR will change that). Due to voting turnout, Referendum 72 will not be executed before the first scheduled call, set to happen at block height #16_367_188. This means that the first batch of auctions for LP27 will not be executed, as the scheduler pallet does not allow the execution of an action in a past block (the other batches will be scheduled).\n\nIn order to alleviate the demand of auctions (teams that need to renovate their slot during LP27 to keep uptime of their parachains will not be able to do so, therefore having to interrupt their service to the community) we have proposed the following two referenda, up for vote now and scheduling 3 auctions from next week:\n\nThis referendum aims to schedule the following 2 auctions (after [the 1st one scheduled by [this proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referenda/80)) using the scheduler pallet via **Root Caller**. The new Scheduler call will need to execute before block #16_568_788.
