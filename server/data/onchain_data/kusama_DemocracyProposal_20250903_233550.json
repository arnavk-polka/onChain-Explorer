      "title": "Swap Mangata X Slots",
      "content": "Mangata X is requesting to swap slots between Para ID 2110 (‚Äùoperating parachain‚Äù) and Para ID 2256 (‚Äùcrowdloan parathread‚Äù). Mangata X has been an operating parachain under Para ID 2110 since early last year. A crowdloan parathread 2256 had to be created to facilitate a second crowdloan. After successfully winning an auction, this proposal aims to swap slots.\n\nMangata X is currently the only DEX chain exposing the native tokens of the Turing and Imbue Networks to the broader ecosystem, as well as making several Bifrost tokens available for trade. It would be beneficial for the whole ecosystem to support Mangata X in continuing operations.\n\n## Why are you not just sending an upward message from both chains?\nWe announced a crowdloan start date to the community and when we tried to initiate the crowdloan and Kusama told us it is not possible. [We have flagged this as an issue on Github.](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/6592#issuecomment-1398277227)\n\nWe had to quickly create a new ParaID and did not have the time to compile a proper WASM. Hence, it will not be possible to let the new parathread signal its intention. Additionally, we were not aware that slot swapping is available at the time, as we could not find any documentation on it. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqAtu4s_jpc) was created since then to explain parts of the situation.\n\n## Proposal\n\nThe proposal enacts a `utility.batchAll` call that contains two `registrar.swap` calls that are inverse to each other and signal to the relay chain that the slots may be swapped.\n\nEncoded Call: `0x18020846033e080000d00800004603d00800003e080000`\n\nCall Hash: `0xdb8d15125539d52a1c01d2e709a29d4e46de387713c8ad14006f4ec1472264fa`\n\n![](https://mangata-finance.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F9043ef09-4b3b-480c-9f9b-ab4ce64a8154%2FUntitled.png?id=a270aceb-7b51-4017-a5a5-c9c74220e41e&table=block&spaceId=3586d15e-276d-44da-8dca-5f85a846ca5e&width=1340&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n## Proofs\n\nThe owner accounts of both Para IDs have submitted proof that they support the swap:\n\n[https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/16515848-4](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/16515848-4)\n\n![Untitled](https://mangata-finance.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F6ed86c44-882c-46cf-b0e5-9fead4b1b7ed%2FUntitled.png?id=6d828d53-2df4-4c4c-a579-ddad9bf95af3&table=block&spaceId=3586d15e-276d-44da-8dca-5f85a846ca5e&width=1860&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n[https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/16515859-2](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/16515859-2)\n\n![Untitled](https://mangata-finance.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2F3040d65a-af44-42e1-80e0-0a1788f7cfc7%2FUntitled.png?id=85273e8a-d667-4cb4-9c02-3189983225ef&table=block&spaceId=3586d15e-276d-44da-8dca-5f85a846ca5e&width=1850&userId=&cache=v2)",

      "content": "This is a proposal to swap the slot leases of Zeitgeist parachain (2101) with parachain 2231.\n\nThe new parachain runtime seems to contain a bug that could not be spotted during onboarding in a local relay chain environment, since it worked flawlessly. However, on the live environment the collator panics during block production. The original plan was to execute the swap via XCM, however this is not possible now anymore. Once lease 25 expires, Zeitgeist parachain will downgrade if no swap is executed before.\n\nTo be able to provide continuous operation of the prediction market protocol, we kindly ask the Kusama community to execute the swap via governance.\n\nTo prove that the swap is authorized, a signature is applied by the manger of parachain 2231 (that will lose slot leases to 2101).\n\nMessage (includes timestamp): `[1668545144] I hereby authorize the swap of slot leases between parachain 2231 and 2101 on Kusama`\n\nManager account for 2231 (`registrar.paras(2231)`): `E8MLdGgiZxAJNUJggDYSM6j3tiLYEDRbtRmDF5fhse8xqaK`\n\nSignature: `0x2cbb57e83bb5cc37a7d0304d467f688561ec4cf05ed2aca85722e87a340ea07ef4e6eca4c83140dd356dbcded8b52f361e0cc1e333991a5ef5cfceaf1285be8a`",

The weights and fee allowance have been copied from https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1744 - the weight used by most previous proposals is no longer sufficient. The main goal for this proposal is to allow currencies from Statemine to be used on Kintsugi as collateral for vaults.\n\nAs is usual for opening HRMP channels, the extrinsic consists of a batch of two calls:\n\nA 11 KSM force transfer from Kusama treasury (```F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29```) to Statemine (```F7fq1jSNVTPfJmaHaXCMtatT1EZefCUsa7rRiQVNR5efcah```) to pay for fees and for the deposit.\nSend XCM message to Statemine to execute a transaction with superuser (root) permission.\n\n**Relaychain preimage Data:** ```0x1802080402006d6f646c70792f747273727900000000000000000000000000000000000000000070617261e80300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b00b01723010a630001000100a10f0204060203009435779d011f000101000214000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e800060003009435775c1802083c002c080000e8030000009001003c012c080000140d010004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000```\n\n**Relaychain preimage Hash:** ```0xd8e1922b946a22f45ea223582130271f6c5bf73dbc469c1c0bff243aad39a14e```\n\n**Relaychain preimage url:** [polkadot.js view](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/extrinsics/decode/0x1802080402006d6f646c70792f747273727900000000000000000000000000000000000000000070617261e80300000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b00b01723010a630001000100a10f0204060203009435779d011f000101000214000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e800060003009435775c1802083c002c080000e8030000009001003c012c080000140d010004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000)\n\n\nThe call above will execute the following on Statemine:\n**Statemine xcm call Data:** ```0x1f000101000214000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e800060003009435775c1802083c002c080000e8030000009001003c012c080000140d010004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000```\n\n**Statemine xcm call Hash:** ```0x9a427a849d70d4f2e4b105ed211f14e9b9a27eaee7cde2c1db8aecc9c0a24263```\n\n**Statemine xcm call url:** [polkadot.js view](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fstatemine.api.onfinality.io%2Fpublic-ws#/extrinsics/decode/0x1f000101000214000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e800060003009435775c1802083c002c080000e8030000009001003c012c080000140d010004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000)",

      "title": "YOLO - Setting the Minimum Commission to 8.5%",
      "content": "Good morning :)\n\nThis referenda seeks to increase the minimum commission from 3.0% to 8.5% and keeps all other staking configurations unchanged.  It is being proposed to foster a sustainable environment for all validators in light of reduced on chain returns as well as present market conditions.  \n\nAppreciating that there was no forward discussion I anticipate there will be emphatic responses.  To aid with your decision making I've also included some supporting data for your consideration.\n\n**Effects on validator earnings**\n\nA validator operating at 3% commission can stand to earn (485.2/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.03 = 1.75 KSM/month, this equates to ~70 USD/mth.  \n\nThe proposed configuration allows validators to earn (485.2/1000)* 4 * 30 * 0.085 = 4.94 KSM/mth which equates to ~ 200 USD/mth\n\n**Effects on nominators**\n\nAssuming a total stake of 6600 KSM, at 3% commission a nominator earns ~10.42% APY whereas at 8.5% commission a nominator* would earn ~9.83% APY, a 0.59% difference.\n\n**Validator commission distribution**\n\nThree hundred and eight (308) potential validators would be affected by the change to varying degrees.\n\n- 0.00% - 13 [Chilled stashed]\n- 3.00% - 234 - [+5.5%]\n- 3.14% - 1 - [+5.36%]\n- 4.00% - 6 - [+4.5%]\n- 4.20% - 1 - [+4.3%]\n- 5.00% - 28 - [+3.5%]\n- 5.60% - 1 - [+2.9%]\n- 6.00% - 4 - [+2.5%]\n- 7.00% - 1 - [+1.5%]\n- 8.00% - 19 - [+0.5%]\n- 9.00% - 1\n- 10.00% - 122\n- 13.00% - 1\n- 15.00% - 61\n- 20.00% - 4\n- 50.00% - 10\n- 100.00% - 493\n",

      "content": "This proposal aims to open HRMP channel between Statemine & Picasso. For more context please read here.\n\nLet me explain the technical details of this call. It is a batch transaction with two calls:\n\n1. A force transfer from Kusama treasury (`F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29`) to Statemine (`F7fq1jSNVTPfJmaHaXCMtatT1EZefCUsa7rRiQVNR5efcah`). The amount is 11 KSM. 10 KSM will be used for deposit to accept (5 KSM) and open (5 KSM) HRMP channel. 1 KSM will be used by Statemine parachain to pay for transaction execution fee on Kusama. Note that 1 KSM is more than enough and unused funds will be trapped in XCM asset trap. But that's totally fine as it can be claimed & used for transaction fee in later XCM executions.\n\n2. Send XCM message to Statemine to execute a transaction with superuser (root) permission.\n\nThe XCM message to Statemine is `0x1f00010100020c000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e800060002286bee5c1802083c01270800003c0027080000e803000000900100`, which can be decoded on Statemine, and it is `polkadotXcm.send`. It sends a XCM message back to Kusama, to with 1 KSM for transaction fee and perform a transact of call `0x1802083c01270800003c0027080000e803000000900100`.\n\nThe call is is a `batchAll` that accepts open channel request from Picasso, and make an open channel request to Picasso.",

We advise you to not vote or vote without conviction as to not lock up your tokens unneccessarily.\n\nIf you want to send a signal that you do not tolerate such behavior, we appreciate you voting with 0.1 weight, which results in no lockup.\n\n\n## Kusama: Stand up against theft and for an ethical ecosystem that cares about its users\n### Support our governance proposal to return 11,700 KSM from an attacker to their rightful owners.\n\n**11,700 KSM (~500,000 USD) were stolen from the Kusama DEX Mangata X.**\n\nLast week, a new type of governance attack targeted Mangata X. After the hostile takeover of the Mangata X on-chain Council, the attacker withdrew all KSM held by the Kusama DEX. It essentially meant the attacker cut off the life blood of the upcoming DEX and threatened to stop the growth trajectory, trust and liquidity of the DEX and erase the wealth of our community.\n\n**We cannot let thiefs stand in the way of our growing ecosystem!**\n\nMangata stands up for fairness. We believe that we can build a better, more equitable DEX that provides a level playing field for everyone. Crypto can do better! We didn‚Äôt want to let this chance die and made a difficult decision. A decision that allowed the chain to remain operational and protected the funds of our users:\n\n**We replenished the stolen funds with 500,000 USD of our own money.**\n\nWe provided full transparency to our community by publishing a detailed breakdown of the attack, our actions and an analysis in the [Council Incident Report](https://blog.mangata.finance/blog/2022-10-08-council-incident-report/). We also reached out to other parachains, the Kusama Council and core developers of the ecosystem to let them know about this new type of attack and warn them to make sure all measures are taken to prevent such kind of an attack to happen again.\n\n**This was not only an attack on a single chain, it is an attack on the entire Kusama ecosystem.**\n\nEven though thousands of people are working in the ecosystem and hundreds of thousands are stakeholders, it is still in its infancy. It has an incredible potential to fuel the third stage of the crypto revolution, but needs to be carefully developed. Every chain has a role in this growing ecosystem. From Web3 to DeFi to GM chain. Everyone has an important role to fulfill to make Kusama a success. We need to lead this growth with ethics and values.\n\n**Today, we ask you to stand up against theft and for an ethical Kusama ecosystem that cares about its users.**\n\nWe ask you to support our referendum to return the full amount from the attackers account back to Mangata X. This can be achieved if the Kusama community stands together and supports the referendum\n\n**Kusama needs to send a strong signal that it does not tolerate theft!**\n\nWe believe that crypto is bigger than code is law. We believe that ethics and values can have a place in Polkadot and Kusama.\n\nIf you do believe the same, we invite you to join our journey. Follow our socials to stay in the loop:\n- Twitter: [@MangataFinance](https://www.twitter.com/MangataFinance)\n- [Telegram](https://t.me/xmangata)\n- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9hQBPbwAQd_8Fjb4ryspbw)\n- [Discord](https://discord.gg/mangata)\n\nThe attacker can contact us on Element mangata_finance, Keybase mangata_finance, or Email hello@mangata.finance",

      "content": "We unwittingly used the genesis wasm for picasso to register the new parachain 2130 which we intended to use to swap to extended the original picasso (2087) parachain's lease. Unfortunately the picasso genesis wasm is no longer compatible with the relay chain so it doesn't produce blocks which means we can not swap via sending the swap instruction from parachain 2130 to the relay chain. Hence this proposal to swap directy on the relay chain.",

      "content": "This proposal aims to open HRMP channel between Statemine & Calamari.\n\nLet me explain the technical details of this call. It is a batch transaction with two calls:\n\n1. A force transfer from Kusama treasury (`F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29`) to Statemine (`F7fq1jSNVTPfJmaHaXCMtatT1EZefCUsa7rRiQVNR5efcah`). The amount is 11 KSM. 10 KSM will be used for deposit to accept (5 KSM) and open (5 KSM) HRMP channel. 1 KSM will be used by Statemine parachain to pay for transaction execution fee on Kusama. Note that 1 KSM is more than enough and unused funds will be refunded back to the Treasury account.\n2. Send XCM message to Statemine to execute a transaction with superuser (root) permission. The XCM message to Statemine is `0x1f000101000214000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e800060003005ed0b25c1800083c01240800003c0024080000e803000000900100140d01010000000004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000`, which can be decoded on Statemine, and it is polkadotXcm.send. It sends a XCM message back to Kusama, with 1 KSM for transaction fee and to perform a transact of call `0x1800083c01240800003c0024080000e803000000900100`. It will refund any unused funds back to the Kusama Treasury account `F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29`\n\nThe call is is a batch call that accepts open channel request from Calamari, and make an open channel request to Calamari.\n\nThis is a proposal whose proposer address (FzHWXZ2GXMHAYBKQYinNDkRFAAHm8sHFKpMss473e2FTfxL) is shown in on-chain info below.

      "title": "Fix Opening HRMP Channel Between Robonomics and Statemine",
      "content": "This proposal aims to fix the problem that occurred whilst opening the bi-directional HRMP channel between Robonomics and Statemine. The [previous attempt](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/207) successfully passed through the voting stage, but failed on the last stage due to insufficient weight provided for the XCM Transact operation to open channels. This proposal describes the fix for the problem and is based on [the solution](https://hackmd.io/f3NITCDrRJel0ewxzLGMqQ?view) provided by the Polkadot team.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe proposal is to send an XCM message (`xcmPallet.send`) to Statemine to execute a transaction with superuser (root) permission. This time it is not needed to transfer KSM from Kusama Treasury, so the transaction consists only of executing XCM Transact. \n\nPreimage design can be reviewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UX-LJnv3sxBkCJZ5WM5x8KgbvxcJQ4SO).\n\nEncoded call hash:\n\n`0x946b6aee1b23b04bc3a8d1e60642ca567ed6c2e968876eaa981fcf0588c08a39`\n\nEncoded call data of this transaction, which can be decoded on Kusama:\n\n```\n0x630001000100a10f020406020208af2fb5011f0001010002141804000000000760f0f8d1e8000013000000000760f0f8d1e800060003009435775c1802083c01000800003c0000080000e803000000900100140d01010000000004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\n### XCM message\n\nThe XCM message that is sent to Statemine looks like:\n\n```\n0x1f0001010002141804000000000760f0f8d1e8000013000000000760f0f8d1e800060003009435775c1802083c01000800003c0000080000e803000000900100140d01010000000004000101006d6f646c70792f74727372790000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n```\n\nThe message can be decoded on Statemine. It consists of `polkadotXcm.send`, which sends a XCM message back to Kusama to perform `Transact` of this call:\n\n`0x1802083c01000800003c0000080000e803000000900100`\n\nwhich can be decoded on Kusama. This call is a batch transaction with two calls: the first one accepts the open channel request (`hrmp.hrmpAcceptOpenChannel`) from Robonomics (ParaId: 2048), and the second one to make a reciprocal open channel request (`hrmp.hrmpInitOpenChannel`) to Robonomics.\n\nFollowing the guidelines for calculating weight, this time `requreWeightAtMost` is set to 2,000,000,000.\n\nThe message also includes a `ClaimAsset` instruction to claim trapped fee assets (about 0.999955 KSM) from the previous proposal. After `Transact`, it follows up with `RefundSurplus`, which refunds any unused weight from execution, and then `DepositAsset`, which instructs the executor to deposit any KSM that wasn't used on transaction fees back into Kusama Treasury.\n\nPreimage design of the XCM message can be reviewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1loEQuRS-_QwRg2EMH1XVbCLhtsw617Ji).\n\nPreimage design of the a batch transaction for accepting/requesting can be reviewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/127jr8HDlHsTxRbx7d4WdRJbwrTO-hDdb).\n",

      "content": "Dear community,\n\nI submit this proposal on behalf of myself and other participating members of the 1KV.  The proposal attempts to cancel eighteen (18) other proposals numbered seventy four (74) to ninety one (91) inclusive submitted by Paco reasoning given [here](https://twitter.com/paco_dot/status/1544223998636064769?s=20&t=ogqSdkYpxLZXQs-E8tCqhg).\n\nIt is in our opinion that the proposals serves no purpose above proposal seventy-one (71) and occupies the public proposal queue with high conviction (0.5 KSM per).   This increases the barrier to entry for other referenda and puts existing technical proposals seventy-two (72) and seventy-three (73) at lower priority. \n\nRegards,\nWill | Paradox",

      "content": "> Previous [proposal](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/proposal/66) fails because of wrong weight estimation, error fixed in this proposal.\n\nThe aim of this proposal is to open a bi-directional **HRMP** channel between **Statemine** and **Shiden**. Shiden‚Äôs parachain Id is **2007** and this is used in **HRMP** calls for channel opening.\n\nSince previous call was unsuccessful due to incorrect max weight, we do not transfer funds for channel opening from Kusama treasury, only 1 KSM to cover the execution fees. Unused funds are returned back to the treasury.\n\n### 1.

      "content": "This proposal aims to open the bi-directional HRMP channel between [Robonomics](https://robonomics.network/) and Statemine. It is based on similar processes for [Karura](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/163), [Moonriver](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/164), [Basilisk](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/172), [Parallel Heiko](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/188) and [Bifrost](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/165).\n\n### Technical Details\n\nThe proposal is to execute a batch transaction with two calls:\n\n1. A force transfer (`balances.forceTransfer`) of **11 KSM** from Kusama Treasury (`F3opxRbN5ZbjJNU511Kj2TLuzFcDq9BGduA9TgiECafpg29`) to Statemine (`F7fq1jSNVTPfJmaHaXCMtatT1EZefCUsa7rRiQVNR5efcah`) to pay for fees accepting the channel request. 10 KSM will be used for deposit to accept (**5 KSM**) and open (**5 KSM**) HRMP channel. **1 KSM** will be used by Statemine parachain to pay for transaction execution fees on Kusama.\n\n2.

This video will serve as a primer for anyone who plans to make a proposal and to get a sense of the uncertainty aspect of the proposal reaching the referenda queue and subsequently the fate of the referenda. The stats and thresholds, as well as their calculations will be presented in the video, along with hypothetical scenarios which would have swayed the ultimate result.

      "content": "Due to missing `Dest parachain check` on polkadot and an asynchronous bug in DAPP, Parallel Heiko chain's user lost 63KSM. The detailed information has been put inside: [ISSUE 5332](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5332). \n\nParallel Finance paid this loss to the user in [Extrinsic 12280950-4](https://kusama.subscan.io/extrinsic/12280950-4) first and then fixed ParaId fetching bug inside the DAPP. \n\nThe issue happened while reading ParaId asynchronously using `useApiCall`, there is no `await` so there is 0.0001% chance that user submitted xcmPallet.reserveTransferAssets with `undefined` ParaId, which is then serialized to `null` and converted to `0` finally. This issue has been resolved quickly and deployed to [Heiko DAPP](https://app-heiko.parallel.fi), but it'll be good if polkadot can check if parachain exists before sending.\n\nThen for getting this 63KSM back, Parallel Finance asked the user to sign the following message:\n\n```\nI confirm the receipt of 63 ksm transfer from Parallel Finance\n```\n\nUser signed and gave the signature which you can verify on Kusama like [THIS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33961674/163770047-777dab9d-fe31-4678-bef4-2b8f56608089.png)\n\n```\n0x44f7fb444c5b2fe146b17963a7d2307b05da0c0308cfc1d540614a74a675056c7897c4ee89945038d2dfc99bdaceba9c1f3ff90fa300f59a5387a3fdc18d778a\n```\n\n",

JAM is one of the early council members and you can get an appreciation of his 'genesis story' [here](https://youtu.be/B0Fex0fSYkQ).  His lack of a registered identity was a personal peeve so with an empty public queue I seized the opportunity for a soft-topic.  \n\nI should have done the same for Bruno via batch but it was a total omission on my part. With [resignation](https://bruno.id/withdrawing-from-polkadot-and-kusama-council/) in mind perhaps it wasn't that bad of an omission.\n\nWe are generally caught up with referenda of technical matters, governance can be used for softer matters as well.  Let's see how it goes.\n\nRegards,\nWill | Paradox",

All other parameters that are associated with the configuration remains the same as prior.  \n\nFor transparency the previous values are:\n\n- Minimum Nominator Bond : 0.1 KSM\n- Minimum Validator Bond: 0 KSM\n- Max Nominator Count : 20,000\n- Max Validator Count : 4,000\n- Chill Threshold: null\n- Minimum Commission: 0\n\nThe value of 3% was determined after several [days of discussion](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/post/1306) and reflects a conservative position which is further held by low rates of exchange.  We trust that the foregoing would benefit the chain by improving the sustainable operations of validators who have qualified into the active set.\n\nBest Regards,\nWill | Paradox",

      "title": "Unbrick Picasso",
      "content": "# Picasso Post Mortem\n\nOn Friday December 17, 2:55:54PM the Picasso parachain on the Kusama relay chain stopped producing blocks, the last block it produced was backed by [relay block #10,561,126](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.polkadot.io#/explorer/query/0x46d9d6036ad79e55f31d10b841cabb5fec3303618e91dfb99b860f289d6b697c). The reason was a faulty runtime upgrade that was applied at parachain block [#75,775](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpicasso-rpc.composable.finance#/explorer/query/0xcaf7f7aa3801aace93afb2828918c3719d688bd299be196b26daa1b1967adfe1).\n\n  \n\n![](https://t20465559.p.clickup-attachments.com/t20465559/cfd749f3-82af-4adb-a03f-85be03323ca3/Screenshot%202021-12-18%20at%207.18.22%20PM.png)\n\n  \n\nSpecifically, a runtime upgrade that changed it's block-times for the aura consensus worker. This piece of documentation here doesn't specify that this value shouldn't be changed once the chain is live and so was updated from `3000` (milli-seconds) to `6000` (milli-seconds). Which was more in line with the relay chain's own expected block times for para-chains which is 12 seconds.\n\n  \n\n![](https://t20465559.p.clickup-attachments.com/t20465559/2fc0fe24-5ed8-4556-950f-8c719cf5f1af/Screenshot%202021-12-18%20at%207.20.48%20PM.png)\n\n  \n\nThe reason it was `6s` in the first place was because our runtime was first a standalone substrate blockchain and had a `6s` expected block time, unfortunately when it was converted to a parachain, this value wasn't updated to parachain standard block time. Which in turn caused spotty block production on Picasso with block times averaging `30s`. Which makes sense, since the collators are authoring blocks every `6s` but are really only allowed to produce blocks every `12s` by the relay chain, so collators often miss their slots.\n\n  \n\nAfter the runtime upgrade, all our collators stopped producing blocks. Primarily because from the perpective of the parachain, the new slot numbers produced by the new runtime code are for earlier slots. From the logs of one of the collators:\n\n  \n\n```\n2021-12-18 05:54:00.506 DEBUG tokio-runtime-worker aura: [Parachain] Starting authorship at slot 136650570; timestamp = 1639806840450\n```\n\n  \n\nNote the slot number, now compare with slot number of the last block on the chain.\n\n  \n\n![](https://t20465559.p.clickup-attachments.com/t20465559/6b6e8c8b-8645-4f50-98e9-a0be410de316/Screenshot%202021-12-18%20at%206.59.53%20AM.png)\n\n  \n\nIt would take roughly 53 years for our chain to start producing blocks.\n\n  \n\nWith the chain unable to produce blocks it became clear we have only 2 options:\n\n  \n\n1.  Reset our parachain runtime wasm on the relay chain with a wasm file that reverts the changes to the `MinimumPeriod` then, create a new chain-spec with that same wasm blob specified as a wasm override, then update our collators so they can resume producing blocks.\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n*   None whatsoever\n\n  \n\nCons\n\n  \n\n*   We still haven't fixed the spotty block production issue which causes collators to miss their slots and would need to do a more complicated runtime upgrade in the future to address this issue.\n\n  \n\n2\\. We can call `paras.force_set_current_head` and `paras.force_set_current_wasm` inorder to reset the chain with a new wasm/header with the correct `MinimumPeriod`\n\n  \n\nPros\n\n  \n\n*   We don't have to plan a more complicated runtime upgrade in the future in order to fix block production times on Picasso as the new chain would be properly configured from the get-go\n\n  \n\n  \n\nCons\n\n  \n\n*   We lose our chain state, but technically its still a Poa chain and nothing critical yet has been stored on it.\n\n  \n\nAfter careful consideration we decided to go with approach 2. primarily because it's the faster route to solving all our problems (un-bricking the chain and `30s` block production). Otherwise we'd have to first modify the aura pallet to support slot offsets allowing us upgrade our chain and successfully change the `MinimumPeriod` value then properly test this new functionality. But luckily because Picasso is also still a Poa (proof of authority) chain, it can afford to be restarted.\n\n  \n\nStarting from scratch with the right config will prevent us from having any more troubles with potentially bricking Picasso even after it becomes community run.\n\n## Proposal\n\nWe'd like to restart the chain from genesis with a new header and wasm file using `paras.force_set_current_head` and `paras.force_set_current_code`",

      "content": "I would like to preface this by saying I support the Integritee project and team. It‚Äôs good stuff.\n\nHowever, there has been a trend as of late, within the ecosystem, of teams launching crowdloans and not being transparent, or changing facts halfway through, after community members have already locked their KSM up for 48 weeks. **This is absolutely unacceptable.**\n\nThe Integritee team recently performed a bait and switch on the community members. They opened their crowdloan with early contributor bonuses, and then the very next day announced they would be having an IDO with KSMStarter. I will not delve into KSMStarter here, as it has been covered extensively [elsewhere](https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1447284438841405443), but suffice to say the community knows they are scammy. Many of us no longer want to contribute to Integritee‚Äôs crowdloan, as we have been misled and lied to.\n\nThe case seems to be that one or more of the VCs backing the Integritee team is forcing them into this partnership. While it is very unfortunate that this project and team are involved in this, we must take these actions for the good of the ecosystem, and to send a message.\n\n**Do not try to trample on the community.\nDo not try to blindside the community.\nDo not try to pull a fast one on the community.\nBe transparent.**\n\nI sincerely hope that Integritee will renounce this partnership with KSMStarter and secure a slot in the future.\n\nThank you to JAM for assisting with the technicals of this proposal, despite having no strong opinion about the subject.\n\nHenceforth, this proposal aims to end Integritee‚Äôs crowdloan on block #10,094,420. This is the soonest that Kusama‚Äôs governance structure will allow. This is one block after this proposal will pass, if approved, and one day before the beginning of the 4th auction. The voting period for this proposal will begin on October 30th at 8AM UTC, at block 9,878,400, and end on November 6th at 8AM UTC at block 9,979,200.\n\nIf passed, there will be an 8 day enactment period, which will result in the changes included in this proposal to be implemented at approximately 8AM UTC on November 14th at block 10,094,400. Integritee‚Äôs crowdloan will be end 2 minutes later at block 10,094,420. \n\nImmediately thereafter, anyone will be able to call the ‚Äúrefund‚Äù function, and all the KSM contributed to Integritee‚Äôs crowdloan will be returned to the contributors. If they wish, the Integritee team can immediately open a new crowdloan if they wish to bid in the 4th auction in this lease period.\n\nWe are now in a waiting period until October 30th. Assuming no other proposals are submitted, this proposal will be selected to be voted on in the next voting period, from October 30th to November 6th. However, if any other proposals are submitted, we have some competition. You can assist us to win, if need be, by ‚Äúseconding‚Äù proposal 51. Please visit the [voting page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/democracy) (set to the Kusama chain) and you will see the ‚ÄúSecond‚Äù button for proposal 51. This will reserve .05KSM until the proposal is passed, or denied. \n\nYou can only reserve .05KSM at a time, so if you have more, you will have to second the proposal many times. You can batch multiple seconds in one transaction, let me know if you need help (it will still take a while). I did not want to bar anyone from helping, so I set it low. **If there is competition, the proposal with the most KSM ‚Äúseconded‚Äù to it will be selected for the next voting period.**\n\nOnce the proposal has been turned into a referenda and is up for vote, you will need to lock your KSM to vote for it as well, on the [voting page](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/democracy). Kusama‚Äôs governance structure features a time-lock voting system, the longer you lock your KSM, the more votes it gets you. **PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU CAN VOTE WITH STAKED KSM!** Longer time-locks will give your votes more weight, and help push this proposal through. \n\nWe may expect opposition.",

      "content": "Previously, the [#129](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/129) referendum proposal has been passed and is in the dispatch queue. Still, after the Bifrost team tested it, it was found that if the total weight of XCM messages in a single block exceeds `ump_service_total_weight`, they will be discarded, resulting in a loss of funds. \n\nFortunately, the original value of `ump_service_total_weight` is `100_000_000_000`; there are not enough XCM messages to trigger this issue. However, if proposal [#129](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/129) is executed, `ump_service_total_weight` will be reduced to `5_000_000_000`. Thus there will be a high probability of triggering hidden issues, so Bifrost proposes to cancel the implementation of the proposal [#129](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/129). Before the final conclusion, in order to minimize the harm, Bifrost proposed this referendum proposal to readjust `ump_service_total_weight` to `100_000_000_000`, Fortunately, the proposal [#129](https://kusama.polkassembly.io/referendum/129) has been revoked by the council through motion, so this proposal (#133) no longer needs to be executed. It can be rejected, thanks to everyone.\n\nThanks to the Acala team for cooperating with the test, and related [issues](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/3782) have been raised for repair.\n\nExpect Chaos",

      "title": "A registrar service on Kusama focusing on automatic verifications",
      "content": "## Introduction\n\nWith this proposal, we want to introduce a registrar service that focuses on automatic verifications, leveraging well-designed cryptographical challenges to further reduce human interventions. \n\nIn this document, we also share the implementation details and screenshots of key verification steps to offer readers a better understanding of how the respective verification workflow operates.\n\n\n## Implementation Details\n\nThe key components of the Litentry registrar are shown as follows. It mainly includes **Validators**, **Event Listener**, **ProvideJudgement** Service and **Database** Service. Figure1.1 presents the architecture of the Litentry registrar, and Figure1.2 shows the main workflow of the registrar.\n\nThe *Event Listener* listens to all events coming from the Kusama chain. Once a *JudgementRequested* event is triggered on Kusama and the *JudgementRequested* indicates to use the Litentry registrar, the *Event Listener* service will invoke *Validators* starting the verification process. \n\nAt the current stage, the *Validators* consist of three verification services, **Email**, **Element**, and **Twitter** verification. After receiving the verification request from the *Event Listener*, the Validator will invoke those verification jobs. They will send a verification link to the users provided accounts and wait for user confirmation from their accounts. As soon as the user confirms all verification links, the ProvideJudgement service will complete the final step, providing judgement for the user. The implementation details will be introduced in the next section separately.\n\nOnce the user proves the ownership of the **Email**, **Element,** and **Twitter** account, the *ProvedeJudgement* service will send a JudgementGiven transaction on the Kusama to confirm the ownership of the accounts that the user provides.\n\nThe *Database* service will temporarily store users‚Äô data, e.g. Kusama account, **Email**, **Element**, and **Twitter** account, so that we can recover services from an unpredictable crash. After completing the verification service, those data will be removed from the server permanently.\n\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1jfbLKJxzuv_0sbLdlFadz0mmFHLbvlWn)\nFigure 1.1 The Architecture of the Litentry Registrar\n\n\n## Security and Availability\n\nWe use JSON Web Token (JWT) to construct the verification protocol. A nonce and an *ObjectID* (comes from mongodb) are used to generate the JWT token to ensure security of the Litentry registrar. In this implementation, only the user who requests identity judgement, which implies his/her ownership of this Kusama account, will receive this encrypted token. Malicious users cannot construct this token because of an unknown encryption secret, since nonce and ObjectID  are encrypted. And the malicious user has no way to re-play the attacks. \n\nOn the other hand, the websocket (TCP connection) can be easily reset by the remote peer due to long-time idle. In this situation, the events from the Kusama would be never captured since the disconnection between them. To prevent this situation, we capture the events from the underlying websocket connection and reconnect to the Kusama automatically whenever it‚Äôs reset by the peer.\n\n#### Email Verification\n\nIn the email verification process, we use SendGrid to offer the email service. The JWT token is sent to the user through SendGrid. After that, a verification function is invoked on the server-side to check the JWT token's integrity. As soon as the verification link is confirmed, the status of email verification is set to *‚Äúverified‚Äù*.\n\n\n#### Element verification\n\nCompared with the email verification, the Element verification needs one more step. We firstly send an invitation to the user-provided Element account on Kusama data. Once the user accepts the invitation, a JWT token is generated and sent to the user's Element account. As soon as the verification link is confirmed, a verification success message is sent to the user and the status of Element verification is set to ‚Äúverified‚Äù.\n\n\n#### Twitter verification\n\nIn the Twitter verification process, users need to follow the Litentry official registrar account, namely Litentry Registrar (@LitentryReg). Users could also set their accounts to receive any private conversation in their privacy settings. Otherwise, they cannot receive the message from the Litentry registrar. The Twitter verification job then generates the JWT token and sends it to the user's Twitter account. As soon as the verification link is confirmed, a verification success message is sent to the user.  And the status of Twitter verification is set to ‚Äúverified‚Äù.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sObhcLRGLCzkg75F5Aao2SuZHLXzHj76)\nFigure 1.2  The main Workflow of Verification process\n\nAfter all fields provided by the user are verified, the *provideJudgement* service will send a transaction to provide the respective judgement for the user.\n\n\n## User Interaction Highlight\n\n### Email Verification\n\nUsers will receive an email called **\"Litentry Verification Service\"**. Figure 2.1 is an example of email verification. Users only need to click the button \"Verify Email Now\" to complete proof of email address. Then they will receive another confirmation email that shows the email has been verified successfully.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1gQmZEoSvYtYb7OxE1yBWA4Vus4Z7UoZO)\nFigure 2.1 Email Verification Example\n\n\n\n### Element Verification\n\nAs for Element, an invitation will be sent from the bot named **\"litentry-bot\"**. Once the user accepts the invitation, \"litentry-bot\" will send a verification link. Users only need to click the link to complete verification of the element account. When it proves the user is the account owner, they will receive a confirmation message such as \"Verified successfully\" (see the figure below).\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12vlbEviR60c2yYrmAYLLixNOpIAUXx-7)\nFigure 2.2 Element Verification Example\n\n\n\n### Twitter Verification\n\n‚ÄúLitentry Registrar‚Äú will send a direct message associated with a verification link to the user if he/she follows the Twitter account ‚Äú@LitentryReg‚Äù.  Once the verification link is clicked, \nthe verification of Twitter is completed, and you should receive a successful verification message. The following figure is an example of the Twitter account verification process.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Wtezykq7RLzYmM5Ep8Cn1H7RgegEev66)\nFigure 2.3 Twitter Verification Example\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\nWe strongly believe that with this Registrar service being part of the Kusama ecosystem, it can offer users with a more streamlined verification process at a reduced cost while improving the transparency and usability for providing judgement.\n\n",

      "content": "My proposal was to Redenominate Kusama 100:1 and thereby bring all of the benefits of DOT Referendum #52 to Kusama. As listed under Referendum #52. The main benefit of this change is to avoid using small decimals when dealing with DOT and to achieve an easier calculation system. Since Kusama is billed as the value brand between the two sister chains, it is even more important to Kusama and yet Kusama will be using 2 extra decimals over DOT. Additionally, as I now know others have mentioned, the redomination would bring conversations, comparisons, etc between DOT and Kusama into an apples vs apples realm instead of the current apples vs golden apples situation we currently have. Much has been made about DOT and KSMs ability to adapt and change without having to hard fork leading one to believe this change could be made with a simple on-chain rebase command which could change the entire blockchain. Apparently this is not the case. Apparently, it takes a massive amount of work to redenominate the chain. Even more so that when it was done with DOT as transfers have been enabled. It is unfortunate because when DOT was redenominated, would not have been the best time to redenominate Kusama. However, it now appears Kusama can never be redenominated, which is also going to be tragic. It is already a problem, but as KSM becomes more and more valuable this problem is going to do nothing but become worse. However, with all that said, at this point in the market cycle and DOT ecosystem lifecycle, there is absolutely nothing even as close as important as the deployment of the parachains. This is one of the main premises the DOT ecosystem is built on and nothing must get in the way of it. This is my mistake and if I had known it had been proposed before and if I knew how much work needed to be done to implement it, or if I had know how much confusion it could cause I never would have proposed it. To the developers, is there some ability to add rebase functionality into the code in a more convenient time in the future? Or anyway to accomplish this at a more convenient time as there are substantial benefits to KSM with the redenomination?",

The outcome will likely also mirror on Polkadot.\n\n**NOT** Voting means \"Yep, get rid of this extra costly human check\".\n\n## Context\n\nSince its introduction, `Registrar #1` is performing a human verification for every single identity verification.\nThis is even currently done twice per verification and I plan on reducing this to either 1 occurence or even 0.\n\nWhether a human verification should be maintained is the topic of this vote and I would like to gather the general opinion. This is a signaling vote and I reserve the right to make the final call on this topic.\n\nI am inclined to remove the human step for every single verification for the following reasons:\n- it takes time (quite some...)\n- Meanwhile, I have improved the automatic checks in the process to the point where my automatic checks are aligned with my \"human\" checks and the manual verification becomes rather useless\n- it increases the costs (= the registrar fee)\n- I have the feeling users don't really care about the extra check and would rather pay less\n\nIf my feeling is incorrect and this human check is valued, I will happily think about alternatives.",

      "title": "Redenomination KSM for better parallel chain slot auction testing.ÔºàThe revisionÔºöI'm sorry about my proposal Ôºâ",
      "content": "**The revisionÔºåI'm sorry about my proposal :**\n\nI am sorry that my proposal only considers the system and the market, not considering that the change of this matter will cost the developer a lot of time and energy, so I hope this proposal will be rejected, and I am sorry for my poor consideration\n\n**Here's the developers have to say and I can't agree moreÔºö**\n\nThe remark in the referendum is vague; it's only a signal in favor of or against redenomination, but doesn't state when it would take place or a strategy to handle it.\n\nRedenomination doesn't require anything for the protocol itself, but it requires tons of work interacting with users, wallets, custodians, data aggregators, and other people/teams affected by the decision. It probably falls on Parity/W3F to handle that.\n\na plan from the proposer of how they'd help make this happen is not developed.\n\nthe denomination of KSM doesn't change the economic properties of the network, so the argument that this is to bring Kusama into alignment with Polkadot doesn't hold much weight -The actual work required from a wallet perspective to track at a certain timepoint (like we had in Polkadot) and then dealing with all the messaging around it is not an easy job and requires a complete strategy by many teams, and this is not needed today.\n\nThe confusion this proposal will create if passes will be higher than its benefits: this proposal will not necessarily lead to better system testing accuracy and better market validation.\n\nIt is simply not a pre-condition for the network to prepare for slots auctions.\n\nKusama is a running network, with enabled transfers functionality, unlike Polkadot when redenomination happened: this makes things much more complicated when dealing with this kind of proposals.\n\n\n**Previous proposal:**\n**Reason for that:**\n\n**Cumulus master is already v1,Parallel chain slots may be auctioned at the end of the year.\nI think keeping KSM and DOT consistent will lead to better system testing accuracy and better market validation.\nWe all hope the Kusama parallel chain auction goes smoothly and has complete consistency with the main network Polkadot.\nSplitting KSM will make the kusama parallel chain slot auction and polkadot slot auction smoother and more consistent.\n**\n\nIn brief the proposal has the following four effects:\n\nThe total allocations of KSMs will increase one hundred times from ~10 million to ~1 billion. KSM allocation balances will increase by a factor of one hundred, such that 1 KSM (old) will be 100 New KSMs. The distribution of KSMs does not change, and holders of KSMs still own an equal share of the network as before the change. The precision of KSM will change from 12 decimal places to 10 decimal places. The main benefit of this change is to avoid using small decimals when dealing with KSM and to achieve an easier calculation system, the same as in the Polkadot redenomination of DOT.\n\n**What does this proposal change?**\n\nThe proposal is a change to what magnitude of units is considered the KSM, and does not imply any technical consequences. The lowest unit of the KSM, the Planck, does not change. Rather it is the number of Plancks that make up one KSM that does.\n\nLet's consider how many Plancks constitute a single KSM before the change. Since KSM has 12 decimal places, it would be:\n\n`1,000,000,000,000 Plancks = 1 KSM `\n\nAll KSM allocation holders will keep the same number of Plancks after this change, however where the decimal is being placed will be moved:\n\n```\n Before the change the decimal was here\n   v\n  1.000000000000 KSM \n   \n  100.0000000000 KSM \n     ^\n     After the change the decimal will be here\n```\n\n**This decimal move means that:**\n\n`10,000,000,000 Plancks = 1 KSM`\n\nThis change does not modify the overall allocation of KSMs at the Planck level, and the network share of individual holdings remains exactly the same.\n\nIt does change the fractional divisibility of the KSM from twelve decimal place to ten decimal places.\n\nIn the most basic terms, the proposal is only to change what is called a \"KSM\".\n\n`What is the system remark?`\n\nThe system remark is the utf-8 encoding of the first two sentences of this document.",

      "content": "This proposal takes its cue from the proposal on polkadot and is adapted to the times of kusama. To gradually increase the number of slots for validators, I propose scheduling the increase over time. The scheduled event mechanism aims to increase the number of validator slots steadily upon certain conditions: An increase by 1 every era (6hs) A repetition of the increase for 400 eras. The proposal aims to avoid an abrupt increase in the number of validators on the network reaching the threshold of 1000 validators.",
